intermediate	the canadian tennis player frank dancevic slammed australian open organizers for forcing players to compete in “inhumane” conditions. he collapsed on court as temperatures rose to 41c.dancevic collapsed during the second set of his fi rst-round match against france’s benoît paire on the uncovered court six at melbourne park and passed out for a minute. he said conditions were dangerous for the players. he also said the heat had caused him to hallucinate: “i was dizzy from the middle of the fi rst set and then i saw snoopy and i thought, ‘wow, snoopy – that’s weird.’”“i think it’s inhumane. i don’t think it’s fair to anybody – to the players, to the fans, to the sport – when you see players pulling out of matches, passing out,” he added. “i’ve played fi ve set matches all my life and being out there for a set and a half and passing out with heat stroke, it’s not normal.“having players with so many problems and complaining to the tournament that it’s too hot to play; i, personally, don’t think it’s fair and i know a lot of players don’t think it’s fair.”other players agreed. the british number one, andy murray, said: “it’s defi nitely something that you have to look at. as much as it’s easy to say the conditions are safe, it only takes one bad thing to happen. and it looks terrible for the whole sport when people are collapsing, ball kids are collapsing, people in the stands are collapsing. that’s not great.“i know when i went out before the match, the conditions at 2.30–3pm were very, very tough. whether it’s safe or not, i don’t know. there have been some problems in other sports with players having heart attacks.”caroline wozniacki said: “i put the water bottle down on the court and it started melting a little bit underneath the plastic. so, you know it was warm.”john isner said: “it was like an oven when i open the oven and the potatoes are done. that’s what it’s like.”the defending champion victoria azarenka said, “it felt pretty hot, like you’re dancing in a frying pan or something like that.”under a change to the rules for 2014, the decision on whether to stop matches at the tournament is now at the discretion of the tournament director, wayne mckewen.organizers said temperatures peaked at 42.2c in the early evening on tuesday and conditions had never reached the point where the matches would be stopped.“while conditions were hot and uncomfortable, the relatively low level of humidity ensured play would continue,” mckewen said in a statement.dancevic, who said he had felt dizzy from the middle of the second set, started playing again after medical attention but, unsurprisingly, lost 7–6, 6–3, 6–4. “i was really close to stopping completely,” he said. “i wasn’t really running too much towards the end. i wasn’t tired; i just felt my body temperature was too high.”a ball boy had earlier required medical attention after collapsing during milos raonic’s 7–6, 6–1, 4–6, 6–2 victory over daniel gimeno-traver on the equally exposed court eight and the tournament started only allowing the ball boys to work for 45 minute periods. china’s peng shuai also said the heat had made her cramp up and vomit, and she had to be helped from the court after her 7–5, 4–6, 6–3 defeat to japan’s kurumi nara.offi cials played down health risks – they said the majority of matches were completed without anyone needing medical attention.“of course, there were a few players who experienced heat-related illness or discomfort, but none required signifi cant medical treatment after they had completed their match,” tim wood, the tournament’s chief medical offi cer, said.roger federer said that, although conditions were tough, they were the same for both players. “it’s just a mental thing,” the swiss said. “if you’ve trained hard enough your entire life, or the last few weeks, and you believe you can do it and come through it, there’s no reason. if you can’t deal with it, you throw in the towel.dancevic disagreed. “some players are used to the heat – their bodies can genetically handle the heat and others’ can’t,” he said. “it’s dangerous. it’s an hour and a half since my match and i still can’t pee.”
intermediate	scientists have created an òatlas of the brainó that shows how the meanings of words are arranged across different regions of the brain. the atlas shows in rainbow colours how individual words and their meanings can be grouped together in areas of the brain.òour goal was to build a giant atlas that shows how one speci c aspect of language is represented in the brain, in this case semantics (the meanings of words),ó said jack gallant, a neuroscientist at the university of california, berkeley.no single brain region holds one word or concept. a single brain spot is associated with a number of related words. and, each single word lights up many different brain spots. together, they make up networks that represent the meanings of each word we use: life and love, death and taxes. all light up their own networks.the atlas was described as a great achievement by one researcher who was not involved in the study. the atlas shows how modern imaging can transform our knowledge of how the brain does some of its most important tasks. if scientists make further advances, the technology could have an enormous impact on medicine and other areas of study.òit is possible that this approach could be used to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking,ó said alexander huth, the main author of the study. one possible use would be a language decoder that could allow people who canõt talk, because they have a serious illness, to speak through a computer.to create the atlas, the scientists recorded peopleõs brain activity while they listened to stories. then, they matched the transcripts of the stories with the brain activity data to show how groups of related words produced brain responses in 50,000 to 80,000 pea-sized spots all over the cerebral cortex.huth used short, compelling stories. the stories had to be interesting so that the people in the experiment would focus on the words and not drift off. seven people listened to two hours of stories each. per person, that was a total of about 25,000 words ð and more than 3,000 different words ð as they lay in the scanner.the atlas shows how words and related terms light up the same regions of the brain. for example, on the left-hand side of the brain, above the ear, is one of the tiny regions that represents the word òvictimó. the same region responds to òkilledó, òconvictedó, òmurderedó and òconfessedó. on the brainõs right-hand side, near the top of the head, is one of the brain spots activated by family terms: òwifeó, òhusbandó, òchildrenó, òparentsó.each word is represented by more than one spot because words often have several meanings. one part of the brain, for example, responds to the word òtopó, as well as other words that describe clothing. but, the word òtopó lights up many other regions. one of them responds to numbers and measurements, another to buildings and places. the scientists have created an interactive website where the public can explore the brain atlas.interestingly, the brain atlases were similar for all the people in the experiment. this suggests that their brains organized the meanings of words in the same way. the scientists only scanned  ve men and two women, however. all are native english speakers. it is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different semantic brain atlases.using the atlas, researchers can now piece together the brain networks that represent very different concepts, from numbers to murder and religion. òthe idea of murder is represented a lot in the brain,ó gallant said.uri hasson, a neuroscientist at princeton university, said the work was great. he said that many studies just looked at brain activity when a single word or sentence was spoken but gallantõs team had shed light on how the brain worked in a real-world scenario. the next step, he said, was to create a more complete and precise semantic brain atlas. in the future, hasson believes it will be possible to reconstruct the words a person is thinking from their brain activity. the ethical implications are enormous.lorraine tyler, a neuroscientist and head of the centre for speech, language and the brain at cambridge university, said the research was a great achievement. but, the brain atlas in its current form does not show small differences in word meanings. òthis research is  centre for speech, language and the brain at cambridge university, said the research was a great achievement. but, the brain atlas in its current form does not show small differences in word meanings. òthis research is 4 comprehension check ground-breaking but there is still a lot to learn about how semantics is represented in the brain.ónan
intermediate	we may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm back to the future ii, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is just as exciting and almost as far-fetched. experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally changing transportation. òitõs a very dynamic time,ó said transport expert robert puentes. òthereõs a tighter connection between transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people.óas the transport infrastructure grows old, cities across the us are forced to rede ne what transportation is. urban planners, transportation experts and scientists are now realizing that old methods focused on reducing traf c congestion arenõt enough to solve problems like population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now a key part of protecting the environment.big us cities like los angeles and chicago are working to make better use of their streets by adding more bus lanes and pedestrian walkways, and expanding rail networks. at the same time, they are working on advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment. òthe most sustainable places to live are places that have multi-modal transport systems,ó puentes saidhere are three key ideas that experts predict will in uence transportation in the coming years.connectivity ride-sharing services like uber ð taxis booked via smartphone ð and apps like waze, which uses real-time traf c data to  nd the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people move around and affecting the way traf c moves through a city. communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era, according to allan clelland, an expert on transportation technology.according to a recent study, car travel has reduced among people born in the 1990s compared to previous generations. according to the study, people born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives.people still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to waze. experts say the traf c app has reduced congestion on motorways and reduced travel times for drivers. but it has also led to a problematic rise in cars moving through residential neighbourhoods.this trend could continue as vehicle-to-vehicle data communication, as well as communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure, grows. currently, a traf c light knows when a car is getting close but thatõs all. companies are working to develop technology that will allow a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.automation driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. however, the partial automation of cars is already underway. automation will probably happen in stages:  rst, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: that is, vehicles that are connected electronically and travel in single  le.the idea of a fully automated transportation system is intriguing because it could improve safety by removing human error. it could also help reduce carbon emissions and traf c congestion, and allow more people access to cars. but, even if driverless technology were ready to use now, it would take a long time to get fully automated because the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.to see what driverless cars might look like in action, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.environmental concern as the world races to avoid catastrophic climate change and countries and cities work to meet ambitious emissions goals, these policies could also have a big effect on the future of transportation. concern about the environment could lead to everything from zero- and low-emission vehicles to apps that encourage more walking, biking and carpooling.when considering the future of transportation, itõs also important to keep in mind why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. technologies that reduce the need for those trips ð for example, virtual meetings or telecommuting ð could also have a big effect on transportation.in the past, the idea of a  ying car represented the best in innovation but the technologies that people are imagining and developing now are possibly even more sophisticated ð and more useful in solving the social and environmental problems that we face in the coming decades.nan
intermediate	it was a beautiful summer evening and i decided to go for a swim off doolin pier in county clare, ireland, where i moved in 2012. there was a woman in the water with dusty, a dolphin who has a great relationship with a group of people she regularly swims with. dusty arrived in doolin in about 2008 and hundreds of people have swum with her since, giving the impression that she’s totally tame.that evening, the woman was tickling dusty’s tummy and it just looked so inviting. there were about 20 tourists and locals on the pier, looking at this lovely spectacle. just after i got into the water, dusty left the woman she was with and went crazy – i found out afterwards that she’s very territorial when she is with somebody. her tail was flapping wildly and, at first, i thought it was a display but, then, i realized she was angry. i knew i had to get out of the water so i swam towards the pier but, within seconds, dusty had crashed into me with her snout. it was very powerful and painful, and the speed was amazing. i was pushed forwards violently.all the people on the pier were staring down at me open-mouthed. dusty was still in the water beside me, her tail flapping crazily. that was more frightening than anything: i thought, if she hits me with her tail, i could go under and drown.i was at the pier but couldn’t get out because of my injuries. i felt pure terror. i shouted for help and a guy put his arm in and pulled me out on to the steps. then, another man appeared and said he was an orthopaedic surgeon. he had been driving into doolin when he saw what was happening on the pier. i was so cold and very worried – i didn’t know how bad my injuries were and my biggest fear was internal bleeding. he checked me over and said he couldn’t feel any evidence of bleeding but that i probably had broken bones. i found out later that i had six spinal fractures, three broken ribs and a damaged lung.i was in hospital for five days and off work for five months with limited mobility and pain. then, i was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress. my near-death experience had left me anxious about everything. i felt that people were looking at me in the wrong way, i began to struggle with loud noises and i suffered from memory loss. three months before the accident, i had opened a health-food shop but i had to let it go because i could no longer work.it was the hardest year ever but, now, it’s all behind me. i had therapy, osteopathy and massage, and am building up my own osteopathy practice now. i have a new empathy with patients because i have been one.i am grateful that i am healthy and i really want to prevent other people being injured. we have this lovely idea about dolphins and have faith in them – who would think a dolphin would ever attack a person? if you see a fierce animal coming towards you with its teeth bared, it’s scary, but dolphins have this lovely, wide smile.i don’t have any anger towards dusty. i respect her. but i was in her territory and she’s a wild, unpredictable animal. people need to know that. so many come here to swim with her and they don’t understand how dangerous it can be. several other people were injured that summer.after the man pulled me out of the water, dusty swam away but, then, she came back and was looking at me. our eyes met and i felt there was complete remorse in her. she was a totally different dolphin; the anger had gone. the people on the pier were in awe. when she had that little moment with me, that was the end of the terror. i made my peace with her.

intermediate	the customer next to you in the queue looks quite normal. but, instead of a shopping list, you notice sheõs carrying handwritten notes about the appearance and cleanliness of the store. sheõs been timing the speed of the queue on her phone ... and is that a tiny camera lens in her purse? sheõs probably a mystery shopper.there are approximately 50,000 mystery shopping trips carried out every month in the uk, according to the mystery shopping providers association, and, as more and more spending takes place online, the demand for mystery shoppers is growing. òretailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who are prepared to set foot in a physical store want a service and an experience they canõt get online,ó says simon boydell, spokesman for marketforce, which has more than 300,000 mystery shoppers. òour clients want to measure how well their stores are delivering on that experience.óòwe assign different store locations to each shopper and rotate them so that they never go back to the same shop within three months,ó says jill spencer of mystery shopping company aba. òeach day, they typically spend up to eight hours visiting  ve to ten stores, plus another hour or two  ling detailed reports on every aspect of their visit.ó for that, the mystery shoppers can earn up to £155 a day. they are also reimbursed for their expenses. mystery shoppers who  lm their visits with a hidden camera can earn even more ð around £300 a day.shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy. òiõm typically given between £5 and £20 to spend at each store, to assess the service i receive at the till,ó says mystery shopper laura. òiõm always given a scenario, such as buying something from a speci c department or a new product range, but i can often buy whatever i want ð and keep it.ólike most full-time mystery shoppers, laura is self-employed. her income is around £30,000 to £40,000 a year and that doesnõt include all the freebies she gets on the job. òwith the perks, itõs enough to live on.ó she  nds it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved. òi know it must be because of my feedback or why would they pay me to give it? some of the retailers i shop at win awards for customer service and i think that is down to us mystery shoppers. i feel iõm not just doing a service for my company; iõm doing a service for all shoppers everywhere.óitõs estimated that more than 500,000 people have registered as mystery shoppers in the uk, but just 10% or less manage to get regular work each month. this has led to a dramatic reduction in pay. òonce you got a fee, reimbursement for your purchase and mileage, but you now often just receive a contribution towards a purchase,ó say val, a 51-year-old former mystery shopper. òi worked for 40 different mystery shopping companies for almost 20 years but i gave up entirely three years ago because i had bills to pay and very few assignments paid an acceptable rate.ónowadays, mystery shopping companies mostly give freebies to incentivize their workers. òmarketforce shoppers typically get a couple of pounds for a visit as a token gesture for their time and effort,ó says boydell. òat the most, weõll pay £15 to £25 plus reimbursement for, perhaps, a meal for two or a hotel stay. we donõt directly employ any shoppers so we donõt have to pay them the minimum wage.óòiõd go on a cruise for nothing,ó says laura. òbut i think mystery shopping companies that pay you a nominal fee to travel to a restaurant and eat a meal are exploiting people. i wonõt touch those jobs anymore.ó there are plenty of people, however, that would. hannah, a 41-year-old lawyer, has done nearly 500 visits for the mystery dining company in her spare time without receiving 9 3 pay or travel expenses. she carries out their most exclusive assignments, enjoying £200 meals at michelin-starred restaurants and overnight stays at boutique hotels.but thereõs no such thing as a free lunch, even if you work for a mystery dining company. hannah says she typically spends two to four hours after each visit writing detailed reports on everything from the quality of the food to speci c interactions with staff, whom she always needs to be able to name or describe. she has to memorize all these details while eating her meal because she cannot openly write anything down.òthereõs lots to remember. youõre expected to give feedback while itõs fresh, so iõve had to get up at 5am to write a report before work. itõs a challenging thing to do; you need to be focused, articulate and detail orientated.ónannan
intermediate	the roof is plastic and the desks are just old chairs, but the students inside the chemin des dunes school are studying hard and hoping for a new life in france.“the french language is very difficult but we try hard. if we come every day, maybe our dreams will come true,” says kamal, a refugee from sudan’s darfur district who comes to three or four hours of classes every day. “it’s a good thing to keep your brain active.”the 29-year-old electrical engineer is one of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of refugees living in the “jungle” camp outside calais who have applied for asylum in france and really want to learn the language of what they hope will be their new home.like many of his fellow students, he is frustrated by the media coverage of the sprawling tentvillage. he says it focuses only on those people who use the village as a place to stay while they make risky attempts every night to sneak on board cross-channel lorries or trains.“i want people in the uk to know that not everyone wants to go there. there are a lot of people here who want to stay in france,” kamal said.france is already home to more than a quarter of a million refugees, according to united nations data – this is more than twice as many as the uk, even though the countries have similar populations.there are also 56,000 asylum seekers waiting for permission to stay in france – the second highest number in europe – while, in the uk, there are 36,000.but, while the applicants wait to hear if they can stay, france does not give them any financial support or allow them to work – and the slow process can take many months. the jungle camp offers a free meal a day and a plastic roof over their heads. many decide to live in these basic conditions for a few extra months, rather than jeopardize their chance to stay in france by working illegally.the idea for the school was first suggested by some of the asylum seekers at the start of the summer, when they were bored with sitting around waiting and nervous about starting a new life in france totally unable to communicate. it opened within weeks, on 11 july.“we did it so people can learn french,” said zimarco jones, the school’s nigerian founder, who arrived in calais in 2013 and is still waiting to hear if he can stay. “now, we need to build another one,” he says with a grin.the tiny classroom can hold 30 pupils, crammed into five rows of desks in front of a big green chalkboard and pictures of cartoon animals for each letter of the french alphabet. there are also classes in english, art and t’ai chi but the french lessons, given by volunteers from calais and other towns, are the most popular.“french is not as easy as english but, two weeks ago, i decided there was no way to get to the uk,” says george, another darfur refugee and student. he wanted to cross the channel because he speaks fluent english but, with language classes, he says he is happy to settle in france.“anywhere there is peace, i can stay, no problem,” he says. he is already waiting at the classroom more than half an hour before his teachers arrive.he admits he doesn’t know much about france but says that the classes are slowly helping him understand the country as well as the language.many of the volunteers at the jungle school are local teachers who are giving up their summer holidays.jenny flahaut, 33, who works at a children’s home, volunteered after seeing an advertisement on facebook. “i saw these people in calais every day and i wanted to do something for them,” she said.she is angry about the depiction of migrants in the media and about politicians who have never visited the camp, most recently david cameron, the british prime minister, who talked about “swarms” of people trying to reach the uk.“they don’t know them; they are not like that,” flahaut said as she prepared for an afternoon lesson. “most of them are very good people. they are welcoming and friendly. they want to improve their life and make it better, and learning is part of that.”the teachers and zimarco are focused, now, on setting up a separate classroom for around 200 women and two dozen children. there are ten times more men than women in the calais camp. most feel uncomfortable going to classes with male students they don’t know, the volunteers say.zimarco’s work starting the school is remembered in its unofficial name – everyone in the camp just calls it “zimarco’s school”. after setting up the new classroom, zimarco has more dreams for making the camp a place to live, not just survive. he wants to start a football team for migrants and even dreams of changing the camp name. he hates “the jungle” because he says it implies the residents aren’t people.“we have a discotheque, a house, a mosque, a school, shops,” he says. “we are not animals.”

tales.bits of bone and hair stick out from the black faeces. òit ate a red deer,õõ says mys_ajek, the university of warsaw biologist. òin my lab, i can tell you all about this wolf ð not only its diet but its gender, sexual habits, age, state of health and family connections.õõdna tests have shown that polish wolves are travellers. òone wolf reached the netherlands, where unfortunately it was hit by a car. they have a very big range. they need space. the average territory required by a polish pack is 250 square kilometres,õõ says mys_ajek.òcan we ever reintroduce wolves to scotland?õõ asks student alex entwisle, 23, on a study trip to southern poland from the uk. he and other animal science students have spent the day looking for droppings and paw prints in the beskidy mountains of the polish carpathians.their hot discussion topic is whether to reintroduce wolves to the british isles for the  rst time since the 18th century.mys_ajek toured the scottish highlands in 2015 for the wolves and humans foundation and answered questions from villagers about the polish experience. òthe big difference between scotland and poland is that we eat pork. we do not have many sheep here.òthe similarity is that we have a lot of animals ð 300,000 red deer and more than 800,000 roe deer. in poland, we also have too many wild boar ð about 200,000 ð and these are eating and destroying farmersõ cereal crops. here, wolves are part of the solution,õõ he says.the scientist says wolves can move up to 30 kilometres during a single hunt. òthe beskidy pack is a strong unit, eight or nine animals. this year, we have recorded  ve cubs, two young wolves and two adults.òwe track them using motion cameras in the forest and by following their prints in the mud and snow. in each family group, only one pair of adults has cubs each year. all pack members care for the young.õõmys_ajek, the son of a shepherd, doesnõt understand wolvesõ bad reputation. òwhy did we have to have the fairy tale little red riding hood, with its big bad wolf?õhe is fascinated by these aloof animals who remained in the wild 33,000 years ago when others decided on a much more comfortable life as domestic dogs.mys_ajek says only scienti c arguments ð the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population ð can save europeõs wild carnivores, especially the unpopular wolf. ònatural predators balance the ecosystem. they reduce the number of herbivores, which allows trees to grow tall for birds to nest in.õõthe ban on wolf hunting in the western carpathians became law in 1995 and in the whole of poland in 1998. there are now wolf packs in nearly all the countryõs major forests where the wolves coexist with humans.the polish government pays compensation for farm animals killed by wolves. mys_ajek advises farmers to put up electric fences. he has helped bring back the use of two deterrents that, for reasons no one understands, wolves  nd very scary: strings of small red  ags (that you hang around sheep pens) and the tatra mountain sheepdog.polandõs wolves have been helped by the countryõs late infrastructure development. in 1989, when the communists left power, poland had only one motorway. major road projects began after poland joined the european union in 2004 and they are required to consider wild animals.attitudes have also changed. òfor many years, hunting was cultural. in 1975, there were fewer than 100 wolves in poland. from the 1950s, hunting wolves was encouraged by the authorities. they paid a reward for killing a wolf worth a monthõs salary. it was carnage.õõmys_ajek says that polish wolves are much safer now but they are not completely safe. packs of wolves cross country borders and hunting still happens in neighbouring russia, lithuania, belarus, ukraine and slovakia.he says polandõs new government, elected in october 2015, doesnõt like wolves. òthe environment minister, jan szyszko, is a hunter. there are 120,000 licensed hunters in poland and they have a lot of in uence.òbeing a wolf advocate is not easy. you canõt argue to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction. most tourists want to see the animals but wolves stay away from humans. they have a very sensitive sense of smell.õõthe 12 british animal science students leave the polish carpathians without seeing a wolf. entwisle does not believe that scotland will ever be able to match polandõs success.òit would be amazing for the environment to have wolves back in scotland because of the problem of too many deer. but it would just not be possible because of the roads and sheep.òthere would be problems with farmers, too. in britain, we like predators to be far away and to watch them on television,õõ said entwisle.nannan
intermediate	lego’s profits rose strongly in the first half of 2014, helped by the success of its lego movie, which has stormed box offices in the us and uk.the danish toy firm’s sales rose across europe, the americas and asia as children bought products linked to the film. the film, released in february 2014, took more than $250m in the us and £31m in the uk by the first weekend in april.the movie cost about $60m to make and has been described as an almost perfect piece of marketing. it is entertaining and aimed at consumers who are likely to go out and buy the company’s products.lego’s finance director, john goodwin, said that the lego movie products had a positive effect on profits during the first half of 2014. they are now waiting to see how the products will continue to develop after the launch of the movie on dvd in the second half of 2014.jørgen vig knudstorp, lego’s chief executive, said: “it is a very satisfactory result that shows our significant growth in recent years in a tough economic environment. the result for the first half of 2014 is an outcome of our ability to develop, launch and distribute lego products, which children all over the world put at the top of their wishlists.”lego, based in the small town of billund, started producing its plastic bricks in 1949 and became a popular and well-known children’s toy around the world by the 1970s. but the group lost its way and was on the brink of collapse in 2003. knudstrop took over as chief executive, ending 70 years of family rule, and got rid of hundreds of surplus products. he then refocused the business on its bricks.the company opened its first factory in china in april and opened an office in shanghai to start expansion into the world’s second-biggest economy.nan
elementary	introduction did you know that, in the uk, there is no law that says restaurants have to pass on tips to staff?a new government report asked workers, employers and customers what they thought about tipping. after reading the report, the uk government says it wants to change the rules to make sure that low-paid workers get the tips that customers leave for them.the report said that some waiters are made to pay a 15% administration fee on tips that customers pay by credit or debit card.the government said that it wants customers to know that tips are voluntary. they want the tipping process to be made clearer so that everyone can understand it.we asked waiters around the uk what they think of tipping, including how much money they get from tips and if itõs fair.1. rodri, 37, london: ôaround 50% of a waiterõs income is tipsõ average tips: £60 per eight-hour shift i think they treat waiters best in ... the useverything has got fairer since the tipping scandal in the summer of 2015. this is when lots of restaurants were taking money from tips for administration fees. but you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains.i get about £60 in tips per shift. on a good night, this goes up to over £100 and, on a poor night, itõs around £40. around 50% of a waiterõs income is tips. all restaurants should have to tell customers what they do with tips. american waiters are lucky ð everyone tips in america.2. elle, 22, edinburgh: ôwe never know whether itõs fairõ average tips: £20 per eight-hour shift i think they treat waiters best in ... francei have three part-time jobs. my day job is in a cafe where the staff work both in the cafe and in the kitchen so all our tips go in a pot and we all get the same. my evening job is at a restaurant where we dont get our tips but we get the minimum wage plus an extra £2.50 per hour. my third job is events catering and nobody ever tips.in restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips by card, the staff never see how much the tip is ð so we donõt know if what we get is fair or not. the system seems better in france, where they donõt tip much but being a waiter is seen as a proper job with job security and good wages.3. ashley, 22, london: ôtips go towards customer breakagesõ average tips: £10-15 per eight-hour shift i think they treat waiters best in ... australiai work in a london pub in the evenings and i do day shifts at a local restaurant. in both places, all the tips are collected and shared out at the end of the night. money is taken from the tips to pay for breakages by staff and customers.it is very unfair that our tips are shared out, especially when one member of the team doesnõt work hard enough. itõs really unfair that money from our tips is taken for breakages by customers. the managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without taking our tips. i make around £20 a shift in tips but often i only get £10-15 of that money.i really need tips because i am only paid £7 an hour. iõd prefer to get a good basic wage (like in australia) and not have to rely on tips.4. tom, manchester: ôa big night of tips can help pay the rentõ average tips: £40 per eight-hour shift i think they treat waiters best in ... italywhere i used to work, waiters kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips. the rest went to the other staff in the restaurant.itõs hard to say how much i earn in a shift; maybe about £40. it can make a big difference. sometimes, waiters need a good night to be able to pay their rent.they have got tipping right in italy, where customers donõt add a big tip but usually round up their bill so, if their meal is û19, they leave a û20 note and donõt ask for change.nan
elementary	scientists have made an òatlas of the brainó. it shows how the meanings of words are organized in different regions of the brain. the atlas uses rainbow colours to show how words and their meanings are grouped together in areas of the brain. òwe wanted to build a giant atlas that shows how the meanings of words are represented in the brain,ó said jack gallant, a neuroscientist at the university of california, berkeley.no single brain region contains one word or idea. a single brain spot contains a number of related words. and, each single word appears in many different brain spots. together, they form networks that represent the meanings of each word we use: life and love, death and taxes. all have their own networks.the atlas shows how modern imaging can completely change what we know about how the brain does some of its most important tasks. with further work, the technology could have an enormous effect on medicine and other areas of study.òit is possible that we could use this technology to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking,ó said alexander huth, the main author of the study. one possible use would be a language decoder that could allow people who canõt talk, because they have a serious illness, to speak through a computer.to make the atlas, the scientists recorded peopleõs brain activity while they listened to stories. then, they matched the transcripts of the stories with the brain activity data to show how groups of related words produced 50,000 to 80,000 responses all over the brain.huth used short, interesting stories. the stories had to be interesting so that the people in the experiment would listen to the words and not fall asleep. seven people listened to two hours of stories each. each person heard about 25,000 words ð and more than 3,000 different words ð as they lay in the scanner.the atlas shows how words and related terms use the same regions of the brain. for example, on the left-hand side of the brain, above the ear, is one of the tiny regions that represents the word òvictimó. the same region responds to òkilledó and òmurderedó. on the brainõs right-hand side, near the top of the head, is one of the brain spots used for family terms: òwifeó, òhusbandó, òchildrenó, òparentsó.each word is represented by more than one spot because words often have many meanings. one part of the brain, for example, is used for the word òtopó and also for other words that describe clothes. but, the word òtopó also uses many other regions. one of them is for numbers and measurements, another for buildings and places.interestingly, the brain atlases were similar for all the people in the experiment. this suggests that their brains organized the meanings of words in the same way. but, the scientists only scanned  ve men and two women. all are native english speakers. it is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different brain atlases.lorraine tyler, a neuroscientist and head of the centre for speech, language and the brain at cambridge university, said the research was a great achievement. but, at the moment, the brain atlas does not show small differences in word meanings. òthis research is amazing and new, there is still a lot to learn about how the meaning of words is represented in the brain.ónannannan
elementary	in iceland, you can be called aagot, arney or ásfríður; baldey, bebba or brá. dögg, dimmblá, etna and eybjört are fine and so are frigg, glódís, hörn and ingunn. jórlaug is ok and so are obba, sigurfljóð, úranía and vagna. but, if you are a girl in iceland, you cannot be called harriet.“the situation is silly,” said tristan cardew, a british cook who moved to iceland in 2000. with his icelandic wife, kristin, cardew is appealing against a decision by the national registry in the capital reykjavik – the registry decided not to renew the cardew’s ten-year-old daughter harriet’s passport because it does not recognize her first name.the registry does not recognize the name of harriet’s 12-year-old brother duncan either, so, until now, the two children have travelled on passports with the names stúlka and drengur cardew, which mean girl and boy cardew. but, this time, the registry has decided to apply the law. “and the law says no official document will be given to people who do not have an approved icelandic name.”the situation meant the family were going to miss their holiday in france but they have applied to the british embassy for an emergency uk passport, which should now allow them to leave.names are important in iceland, a country of only 320,000 people. the law says that – unless both parents are foreign – the names of children born in iceland must be submitted to the national registry within six months of birth. if a name is not on a recognized list of 1,853 female and 1,712 male names, the parents must get approval from the icelandic naming committee.about 5,000 children are born in iceland each year and the committee receives about 100 applications. it rejects about half of these names because it wants to preserve the icelandic language. there is a law that says names must be able to have icelandic grammatical endings and should be written using the ordinary rules of icelandic spelling.what this means is that names with letters that do not officially exist in iceland’s 32-letter alphabet, such as “c”, are not permitted. also, names that cannot be used with the case endings used in icelandic are also rejected. “that was the problem with harriet,” said cardew.the country’s naming laws have been criticized in recent years: in 2013, blær – “light breeze” – bjarkardóttir rúnarsdottir won the right to be officially called her name, not “girl”. the former mayor of reykjavik, jón gnarr, has also called iceland’s naming law “unfair, stupid and against creativity”.the cardews could solve harriet’s problem by giving her an icelandic middle name. “but it’s a bit late for that and much too silly,” said cardew. “are they saying they don’t want us here?”nan
elementary	what is it like to look at the last of something? sudan is the last male northern white rhino on the planet. if he does not mate soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at ol pejeta conservancy in kenya, there will be no more rhinos like them, male or female, born anywhere. and they probably wonõt mate because sudan is 42 so he is old. there are only two other northern white rhinos in the world, both in zoos, both female.the image seems to show that humans are gentle ð armed men guard sudan and stay with him. but, of course, it shows that humans are cruel. sudan is in danger from poachers. the poachers kill rhinos and cut off their horns to sell them for medicine. sudan has had his horn cut off to stop the poachers but he is still in danger.sudan doesnõt know how precious he is. his eye is a sad black dot in his big face as he walks around the reserve with his guards. his head is a marvellous thing. it is a majestic rectangle of strong bone, a head of pure strength. how terrible that such a powerful head can be so vulnerable.sudan does not look so different from the artist albrecht durers rhinoceros from 1515. durer was a renaissance artist. he drew an exotic beast from an exotic place. in 1515, the ruler of gujarat in india sent a live indian rhinoceros to the king of portugal. the king sent it to the pope but the ship sank and it died.human beings ð we always kill the things we love. this hasnõt changed since the ice age. there are beautiful pictures of european woolly rhinos in caves in france that were painted up to 30,000 years ago. these ancient relatives of sudan were gentle and powerful, like sudan. a woolly rhino in chauvet cave seems young, an animal full of life. but the same people who painted such sensitive pictures of ice age rhinos helped to kill them all.today, people love rhinos. but, at the same time, people are killing more and more rhinos. the northern white rhino is the rarest kind of african rhino. there are more southern white rhinos and black rhinos. but, in some countries, more and more people want rhino horn to use as a traditional medicine. and this increases the poaching. in 2007, 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in south africa. in 2014, 1,215 rhinos were killed for their horns in south africa.the vulnerable northern white rhino has nearly been hunted to extinction ð in spite of the guards and their guns. the poaching is totally out of control. the javan rhinoceros is also nearly extinct. india has successfully protected the indian rhinoceros but here, too, poaching is a problem. sudan is such a majestic animal. have we learned nothing since the ice age?
elementary	nelson mandela, the most important person in africa’s fight for freedom and a hero to millions of people around the world, has died at the age of 95.south africa’s first black president died with his family with him at home in johannesburg after years of illness.the news was told to the country by the current president, jacob zuma, who said mandela died around 8.50pm local time and was at peace.“this is the moment of our deepest sorrow,” zuma said. “our nation has lost its greatest son.“south africans, nelson mandela brought us together and it is together that we will say goodbye to him.”zuma said that mandela would receive a state funeral.barack obama called mandela by his clan name – madiba. the us president said: “madiba transformed south africa – and moved all of us.”uk prime minister david cameron said: “a great light has gone out in the world” and he described mandela as “a hero of our time”.fw de klerk – the south african president who freed mandela from prison and shared the nobel peace prize with him in 1993 – said the news was very sad for south africa and the world.he was a great unifier,” de klerk said.in soweto, people came together to sing and dance near the house where mandela once lived. they sang songs from the anti-apartheid struggle. some people were wearing south african flags and the green, yellow and black colours of mandela’s party, the african national congress (anc).mandela’s death sends south africa deep into mourning nearly 20 years after he led the country from racial apartheid to democracybut his death will also be felt by people around the world who thought mandela was one of history’s last great political leaders, similar to gandhi and martin luther king.after spending 27 years in prison, including 18 years on robben island, mandela won the country’s first multiracial election in 1994, with his party, the anc.born with the name rolihlahla dalibhunga in a small village in the eastern cape on 18 july, 1918, a teacher at mandela’s school gave him his english name, nelson.he joined the anc in 1943. in 1952, he started south africa’s first black law firm with his partner, oliver tambo.when the anc was banned in 1960, mandela went underground. after the sharpeville massacre, in which 69 black protesters were shot dead by police, he took the difficult decision to begin an armed struggle. he was arrested and sent to prison for life.finally, in 1990, fw de klerk ended the ban on the anc and mandela was released from prison.archbishop desmond tutu, said: “he made people believe in africa and africans again.”mandela’s 91st birthday was celebrated by the first annual “mandela day” in his honour. he was married three times and he had six children, 17 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.nannannannannannannannannannan
elementary	mountain climber, kenton cool, has just flown down from everest base camp to kathmandu, the capital of nepal. cool is talking about the three amazing climbs he completed the previous weekend. early on saturday morning, he reached the summit of nuptse, the first of the three main summits in the everest “horseshoe”. later that day, he climbed to the summit of everest, and reached the top in complete darkness early on sunday. he then continued to the summit of lhotse, the third of the three peaks, on monday morning.he says he took advantage of a rare opportunity. “for the first time since the late 1990s, there were fixed ropes on all three mountains. what i did was still a great physical achievement. but the person who does it next will do it without ropes or bottled oxygen.”asked cool to look forward and imagine what top climbers might do 60 years from now. “i hate to think,” he says, but he mentions the swiss climber, ueli steck, who fled the mountain in april after an argument with a group of sherpas. steck was planning to climb everest’s west ridge and then immediately climb lhotse via a new route without fixed ropes. “ueli trained like a machine,” cool says. “he’s a fantastic climber. it would have been amazing.”what will tourism look like in the everest region in the future? one clue is in the amazing helicopter rescue by simone moro, steck’s climbing partner. moro flew back to everest on tuesday in a powerful helicopter to rescue a climber at 7,800 metres.it was the highest rescue ever on everest and highlights the increase in helicopter flights in recent years. by 2073, there might be a helipad on the mountain that would bring tourists. at the moment, they use helicopters to rescue both climbers and trekkers who walk to everest base camp.mountain geographer and environmentalist, alton byers, thinks it is not certain that everest can take more tourists. the combination of climate change and tourism, he says, is putting new pressure on the area. glaciers in the everest region are getting smaller, and even disappearing, and this is having a big effect already. “everywhere you go, people are talking about how there’s less water. there’s less water for agriculture and less water for all the new lodges that they are building.”they are building a new pipeline to bring water for the tourists. the local stream is contaminated with human waste and does not provide enough water for a place that is full of tourists. “every village is digging a pit for garbage. khumbu has the highest landfill sites in the world,” he says. human waste is now taken away in plastic barrels but then, according to byers, these barrels are emptied into a huge pit down the valley – it could contaminate the region’s streams and rivers.“we can solve these problems, but we need to be serious about it,” he says. “one climber can spend $85,000 to climb everest. and that’s fine. but we’re going to have to look at these other problems. for half a million dollars a year, you could solve most of them.”climate change is another problem. weather patterns are changing and this is also having an effect on tourism. cloudy weather is closing lukla airport, the entrance to the everest region, more often. they are building a new road for 4x4s to lukla, to make sure tourists and their money can reach everest. but byers is worried that these new roads, which they are building very quickly, could cause soil erosion and landslides. he says that everest is the perfect place to study some of these problems, like the effects of climate change and tourism.nannannannan
elementary	illegal downloading is morally wrong, and it is theft, the same as putting your hand in someone’s pocket and stealing their wallet is theft, says author philip pullman. in an article for magazine index on censorship, pullman, who is president of the society of authors, strongly defends copyright laws. he criticizes internet users who think it is ok to download music or books without paying for them.“the technology is so dazzling that people can’t see that what they’re doing is wrong,” he writes. “it is outrageous that anyone can steal an artist’s work without punishment. it is theft, just as putting your hand in someone’s pocket and taking their wallet is theft.”his article comes after music industry leaders met british prime minister david cameron in downing street to discuss the issue of web piracy.pullman, writer of the his dark materials trilogy, says authors and musicians work in poverty for years to bring their work to the level “that gives happiness to their audiences and, when they achieve that, the possibility of making money from it is taken away from them”. he concludes: “if we want to enjoy the work that someone does, we should pay for it.”pullman is writing in the next issue of the campaign group’s magazine in a dialogue with cathy casserly, chief executive of creative commons. casserly argues that there is a lot wrong with copyright, which was created a long time ago. she writes: “copyright closes the door on the many ways that people can share, build upon and remix each other’s work, possibilities that we could not imagine when those laws were made.” she says artists need to think creatively about how they earn money from their work.index on censorship agrees. the magazine’s editor, rachael jolley, said: “existing copyright laws don’t work in the digital age and they criminalize consumers. we need new ideas for how artists, writers and musicians can earn a living from their work.”illegal downloading is a very big problem. between november 2012 and january 2013 in the uk, 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated along with 52 million tv shows, 29 million films,18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files.18% of internet users aged over 12 say they have pirated items, and 9% say they are afraid they will get caught. pullman writes in his article: “the ease and speed with which people can get music in mp3 is still very surprising to people like me who have been building up their itunes list for some time.”after the downing street meeting, cameron asked the conservative mp mike weatherley to be his adviser on the subject. the bpi, an organization that supports music companies, said: “mike weatherley is a strong supporter of copyright and the artists and creative producers it’s there to protect. we hope his influence and the prime minister’s support for copyright will change how we see illegal downloading in the uk.”nan
elementary	margaret thatcher, the most famous british prime minister since winston churchill, has died at the age of 87. she was in poor health for many years, suffering from dementia. the british government says that her funeral will be at st paul’s cathedral.the british prime minister, david cameron, said: “i was very sad when l heard of lady thatcher’s death. we’ve lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great briton.” he added: “she was our first woman prime minister – and she didn’t just lead our country, she saved our country.” he added that he believed she would be remembered as the greatest british peacetime prime minister.president barack obama said, “here in america, many of us will never forget her close friendship with president reagan.”margaret thatcher was the first woman leader of an important western state. she was prime minister for 11 years until members of her own party removed her in 1990.when they heard of her death, politicians from all parties sent tributes.british labour party leader, ed miliband, said: “she will be remembered as a unique person. she changed the politics of a whole generation. she was britain’s first woman prime minister. she was a huge figure in the world. the labour party disagreed with a lot of what she did, but we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength.”the former conservative prime minister, sir john major, said that people who worked closely with her would always remember her courage and determination in politics and her humanity and generous spirit in private.the “iron lady” was a close ally of the us president ronald reagan in the final years of the soviet union. the union broke up because of reforms introduced by mikhail gorbachev. he was the russian leader who thatcher liked and worked closely with. as a result, many ordinary people in ex-communist countries still think of her as someone who supported their freedom.it was a surprise when thatcher became party leader in 1975. within ten years, she had become famous around the world – people both admired and hated her – for her reforms in the uk and her strong beliefs in foreign policy. she had a long battle with the ira, which almost killed her with a bomb in 1984.in the uk, thatcher’s main economic policy was the denationalization of state-owned industry – the new word “privatization” became used in many countries. she also defeated militant trade unions, particularly the national union of miners, after a long and terrible strike that lasted almost a year. with money from britain’s north sea oil fields, she was able to change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies – including some members of her own party.as the british economy became healthy again after the problems that her policies caused, it seemed for a short time that no-one would ever defeat her. but, as her friends and supporters retired or were replaced, she started to make mistakes and became more and more unpopular. finally, in 1990, after a vote among conservative mps failed to support her, john major took control of the party.after she retired, she wrote her memoirs and continued to promote her values around the world.nannannannannan
elementary	angry waiters are asking people to support their battle to keep their tips. protesters plan to target pizzaexpress restaurants, to try to get the restaurant chain to stop taking a percentage of tips for staff that have been paid on credit and debit cards. protesters have also started an online petition ð they hope that people who go to the restaurants will support them.some employees are very angry because pizzaexpress keeps, as an admin fee, 8p out of every £1 paid when tips are given by card. the chain, which has 430 restaurants in the uk, earns around £1 million a year from this practice, according to the union unite.òwe believe this 8% fee is unfair. if the chain values its staff, it should pay them the total tips from customers,ó said chantal chegrinec of unite. òwe are starting with pizzaexpress but they are not the only company who do this. and we will target other companies after this.óthe  rst protest will take place at a pizzaexpress restaurant at the british museum in london. unite did a survey of pizzaexpress staff after a chinese company bought the chain in 2014. lots of the staff complained about the 8% deduction from their tips so thatõs why unite began the campaign.one angry pizzaexpress employee, who does not want to give her name, said that the admin fee cost her £3 a night. òi have worked at pizzaexpress for 15 years,ó she said in a letter to unite. òafter all this time, iõm still only paid the national minimum wage of £6.50 an hour. so you see my colleagues and i need customer tips to increase our low wages. i work hard and am good at my job but, when pizzaexpress thinks it can take a percentage of our tips, i get upset.órestaurant chains ask and zizzi also deduct 8% of the tips paid by card. but other chains deduct even more. cafe_ rouge, bella italia and belgo deduct 10%; strada and giraffe do, too.a spokesperson for pizzaexpress said that the money they take from tips pays for a system that they use to share the tips among staff. òstaff use this system to decide how to share tips made by card,ó she said.the chain sells 29 million pizzas a year in its uk restaurants. it says it does not make a pro t from the admin fee. but other restaurant groups do not deduct an admin fee from tips. wagamama, pizza hut and tgi friday all take nothing. frankie & bennyõs, chiquitos and garfunkels used to take 10% but stopped years ago.unite recently targeted ten pizzaexpress restaurants in south london. they distributed lea ets to customers ð the customers were òshocked and disgustedó by the practice. pizzaexpress says they mention the admin fee at the bottom of the menus. but the employee who wrote to unite said that customers were always surprised by the admin fee. most customers then paid the tip in cash. almost 6,000 people have signed uniteõs online petition.one waiter said that at least a third of his money is from tips. he doesnõt work for pizzaexpress but has worked for 11 years for another restaurant chain. òi work in a busy london restaurant and i usually serve 150 people every night. i earn £40 to £50 in tips,ó he says. òthat seems like a lot but that money is very important to me because my basic pay is only £6.50 an hour.ónan
elementary	rare mountain gorillas live in the virunga national park in dr congo. the country could earn $400 million a year from tourism, hydropower and carbon credits, said a wwf report. but a british company want to look for oil there.if they look for oil at the unesco world heritage site that crosses the equator, as the congolese government and exploration firm soco international hope, it could lead to terrible pollution and conflict, says the wwf.soco say that they would look for oil in a part of the park called block v, and that their work would not affect the gorillas.soco chairman rui de sousa said that soco knows about the environmental importance of the virunga national park. he also said that oil companies have a central role in today’s global energy supply and that a successful oil project could help a whole country.but raymond lumbuenamo, country director for wwf democratic republic of the congo, based in kinshassa, said that security in and around the park would get worse if soco started looking for oil.“security is already bad. the un is involved with fighting units and the m23 rebel force is inside the park. oil would be a curse. it always makes conflict worse. the park might become like the niger delta. developing virunga for oil will not make anything better.”many people live in the park – over 350 people per square kilometre. oil would not create many jobs, and many more people would come looking for work, lumbuenamo said.one danger is that another eruption of one of the volcanoes in the park could damage oil company buildings and machines and lead to oil spills in the lakes. “virunga’s rich natural resources are for the congolese people, not for foreign oil companies,” lumbuenamo said.but raymond accepted that, although the gorillas were safe now, the park would probably not be able to make $400 million. “it would be difficult to make the kind of money that the report talks of.”the wwf report says that ecosystems in the park could support fishing and ecotourism, and play an important role in providing water and stopping soil erosion.the park is africa’s oldest and most diverse. it is home to over 3,000 different kinds of animals. “virunga is a valuable asset to dr congo,” the report says. “plans to look for oil put virunga’s future in danger,” it says.nannannannannannan
advanced	it was not so much how hard people found the challenge but how far they would go to avoid it that left researchers gobsmacked. the task? to sit in a chair and do nothing but think.so unbearable did some  nd it that they took up the safe but alarming opportunity to give themselves mild electric shocks in an attempt to break the tedium.two-thirds of men pressed a button to deliver a painful jolt during a 15-minute spell of solitude.under the same conditions, a quarter of women pressed the shock button. the difference, scientists suspect, is that men tend to be more sensation-seeking than women.the report from psychologists at virginia and harvard universities is one of a surprising few to tackle the question of why most of us  nd it so hard to do nothing.in more than 11 separate studies, the researchers showed that people hated being left to think, regardless of their age, education, income or the amount of time they spent using smartphones or social media.timothy wilson, who led the work, said the  ndings were not necessarily a re ection of the pace of modern life or the spread of mobile devices and social media. instead, those things might be popular because of our constant urge to do something rather than nothing.the  rst run of experiments began with students being ushered ð alone, without phones, books or anything to write with ð into an unadorned room and told to think. the only rules were they had to stay seated and not fall asleep. they were informed ð speci cally or vaguely ð that they would have six to 15 minutes alone.the students were questioned when the time was up. on average, they did not enjoy the experience. they struggled to concentrate. their minds wandered even with nothing to distract them. even giving them time to think about what to think about did not help.in case the unfamiliar setting hampered the ability to think, the researchers ran the experiment again with people at home.they got much the same results, only people found the experience even more miserable and cheated by getting up from their chair or checking their phones.to see if the effect was found only in students, the scientists recruited more than 100 people, aged 18 to 77, from a church and a farmersõ market. they, too, disliked being left to their thoughts.but, the most staggering result was yet to come. to check whether people might actually prefer something bad to nothing at all, the students were given the option of administering a mild electric shock.they had been asked earlier to rate how unpleasant the shocks were, alongside other options, such as looking at pictures of cockroaches or hearing the sound of a knife rubbing against a bottle.all the students picked for the test said they would pay to avoid mild electric shocks after receiving a demonstration.to the researchersõ surprise, 12 of 18 men gave themselves up to four electric shocks, as did six of 24 women.òwhat is striking is that simply being alone with their thoughts was apparently so aversive that it drove many participants to self-administer an electric shock that they had earlier said they would pay to avoid,ó the scientists write in science.jessica andrews-hanna at the university of colorado said many students would probably zap themselves to cheer up a tedious lecture. but, she says more needs to be known about the motivation of the shockers in wilsonõs study.òimagine the setup ð a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will deliver a harmless but uncomfortable shock, and they are told to just sit there and entertain themselves with their thoughts,ó she said.òas they sit there, strapped to this machine, their mind starts to wander and it naturally goes to that shock ð was it really that bad?òwhat are the experimenters really interested in? perhaps this is a case where curiosity killed the cat.ó
advanced	male bosses are being paid bonuses double the size of those given to female colleagues in identical jobs – a disparity that means men enjoy salary top-ups of £141,500 more than women over the course of a working lifetime.the figures, released by the chartered management institute (cmi), reveal that men in uk management roles earned average bonuses of £6,442 in 2012 compared with £3,029 for women.in the most senior roles, female directors received bonuses of £36,270 over the past 12 months, compared with £63,700 awarded to male directors.the latest figures highlighting the inequitable nature of pay in british business led to calls for action from campaigners on workplace equality.ann francke, the cmi’s chief executive, said: “it’s time to move this issue into the mainstream management agenda.“this is about changing our approach to management to allow for greater flexibility, less masculine cultures, more emphasis on outcomes rather than time in the office and greater transparency around performance and rewards.“in solving this issue, we would actually raise the performance of organizations and the well-being of individuals at work. what are we waiting for?”dr ruth sealy, a senior research fellow at cranfield school of management, added: “it is not surprising. bonuses are a method of payment that can be used with discretion. as to what should be done about it, these things should be made more transparent.”while statisticians warned that some of the data may be skewed by factors such as women entering occupations where there is less of a culture of bonus payments, the discrepancies in the sizes of awards do appear to be aggravating britain’s pay gap, which the government says is closing but still sees full-time male employees earn 10% more than women.maria miller, the minister for women and equalities, said: “the cmi figures are yet another damaging example highlighting that, in the world of work, women still lose out to their male counterparts and that the playing field is far from level.“changes in the workplace are happening and it’s good that the pay gap is closing – but there is still more to do before we see full equality in the workplace.“the government is playing its part: we have made pay secrecy clauses illegal, given tribunals the power to force employers who break equal pay laws to carry out equal pay audits and signed 120 companies up to our think, act, report scheme, which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit, promote and pay women.“we’ve also looked at other pay gap causes, such as having to juggle work and family responsibilities, by introducing shared parental leave and the right to request flexible working to all employees.”large companies such as tesco, bt, unilever and the international law firm eversheds are among those signed up to think, act, report. the scheme has only attracted 120 supporters in nearly two years of existence, having risen from 54 participants in november 2012.however, the cmi’s data did provide some evidence to support miller’s contention that the overall pay gap is narrowing: the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses has appeared to shrink, decreasing from an average of £10,060 in 2012 to £8,502 in the cmi’s most recent figures.however, the institute cautioned against direct comparisons between the 2012 and 2013 samples – which both polled around 40,000 managers – as they are not identical.a sub-set of 17,000 individual managers, whose salaries and bonuses have been tracked over a number of years, showed that male managers’ earnings are rising faster than women’s for the first time in five years, with men enjoying total increases of 3.2% compared with 2.8% for women, when salaries and bonuses are combined.at the most senior level, male directors’ earnings rose by 5.3% over the past 12 months, compared with just 1.1% for female directors.
advanced	you can no longer legally smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the worldõs drinking capital, new orleans, louisiana. city after city has banned indoor smoking but thatõs different because other cities donõt attract tourist dollars by aggressively advertising a òlet the good times rolló attitude, as new orleans does. an indoor smoking ban here will have consequences as unique as new orleansõs cultural ecosystem itself.as the wall street journal recently reported, new orleans city government has, since hurricane katrina in 2005, begun trying to turn down the volume a bit. with the support of neighbourhood groups, the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly, while, at the same time,  ghting to implement a new ònoise ordinanceó (read: music ordinance).òthis is just the wrong time for them to have pursued something like this,ó complains bar- owner william walker, who, for reasons of personal choice, hates the anti-smoking law. òforcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to exacerbate the tension thatõs already there.ómany of new orleansõs best bars and some of its live music spots are in relatively quiet residential neighbourhoods. this neighbourly coexistence is a big part of what makes new orleans different and charming. recently, though, this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of new orleansõs musical personality feels at stake.martha wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music. òthe bar was one of the deciding factors in me buying the house so i wonõt ever complain about the noise,ó says wood, who also manages a live-music bar which, following a series of noise issues in 2013 (including complaints about the loud smokers outside), became one of new orleansõs  rst ever bars legally disallowed from serving drinks to go. ònow, any small infraction could get us shut down,ó says wood. òwe recently installed a smoke eater to help with the smoke because we canõt open the doors at night because of the ônoiseõ.óthe maple leaf club went smoke-free voluntarily in 2014 as did another club where artists had been demanding smoke-free nights. òa lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so i wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesnõt host music,ó says zalia beville, manager of the all ways lounge, which went smoke-free in 2013 because, she says, òthe horn players and the singers, they asked us for it.óluckily, all ways has an outdoor patio, unlike lost love lounge, whose owner, geoff douville, loves the ban ð heõd previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar  nancially viable. òthereõs no way i could have banned smoking in my bar without it being a rule throughout the whole city,ó says douville. òpeople act like i have that choice, as a business owner. but, if i make that rule, they walk down the block to a bar with smoking. so i need it to be uniformed across the board for everybody.ómany small business owners also fear smoke- free revenue loss. smoker neil timms owns an english pub and met the smoking ban before, in england. òback home in coventry, every pub where i was a regular closed within a year of the smoking ban,ó remembers timms of the ukõs ban, begun in 2007. to avoid the same fate, heõs spending money to build a patio.lost loveõs douville, though, feels the ban to be a great business opportunity. òthe number of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar, with our food, but would never come because they didnõt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days ð weõre now an option for all those people.ó nor does douville worry about noise complaints like walker does: òno court is gonna label a bar a ônuisanceõ after the city has rati ed a smoking ban that requires you to go outside!ó he says. òi want to see a judge reconcile ôno loiteringõ with ôno smoking insideõ.ócouncilwoman latoya cantrell, who introduced and pushed the ban, disagrees: òthe responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their clientele respectful outside their establishment as well,ó she says. òthe owners and bartenders need to tell them to go have a smoke but be respectful to their communities. the idea that we canõt have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous. it can be a win-win. i think itõs about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.ócantrell does acknowledge the cityõs uniqueness in terms of a smoking ban. òhow is new orleans different from the rest of the country? new orleans is known as ôthe city that care forgotõ,ó she says. ònew orleans needs to stand up and say ôwe care about our peopleõ. the most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions, these citizens are the backbone of our hospitality industry, which drives the economy in the state of louisiana.ó she adds, ònew orleans is also unlike other places because you do have the option of taking your drink outside with you when you go out to smoke.ómany worried that the already strained new orleans police department didnõt need any part in policing smokers. so the health department will handle bar warnings and  nes. bar customers are encouraged to òcome  ll out a form or call 311 and to include date-and-time-stamped photographs documenting illegal smokingó. for this reason alone, neil timms says heõll comply with the ban: òi donõt want someone to be sitting in the corner smoking and someone takes a photo of õem and gets beaten up.óunworried, geoff douville says that heõs used to noise complaints by now so bring on the ban. òwatch: the nosy neighbours who complain about the noise now are gonna be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban to begin with.ó in the end, douville shares cantrellõs win-win optimism. òof course theyõre gonna complain,ó he accepts. òbut it doesnõt mean theyõre gonna win.ó
advanced	coal is likely to rival oil as the world’s biggest source of energy in the next five years, with potentially disastrous consequences for the climate, according to the world’s leading authority on energy economics.one of the biggest factors behind the rise in coal use has been the massive increase in the use of shale gas in the us.new research from the international energy agency (iea) shows that coal consumption is increasing all over the world – even in countries and regions with carbon-cutting targets – except in the us, where shale gas has displaced coal. the decline of coal consumption in the us has helped to cut prices for coal globally. this has made it more attractive, even in europe where coal use was supposed to be discouraged by the emissions trading scheme.maria van der hoeven, executive director of the iea, said: “coal’s share of the global energy mix continues to grow each year and, if no changes are made to current policies, coal will catch oil within a decade.”coal is abundant and found in most regions of the world, unlike conventional oil and gas, and can be cheaply extracted. as a result, coal was used to meet nearly half of the rise in demand for energy globally in the past decade. according to the iea, demand from china and india will drive world coal use in the coming five years, with india likely to overtake the us as the world’s second biggest consumer. china is the biggest coal importer, and indonesia the biggest exporter, having temporarily overtaken australia.according to the iea’s medium-term coal market report the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today – the equivalent of the current coal consumption of russia and the us combined. global coal consumption is forecast to reach 4.3bn tonnes of oil equivalent by 2017, while oil consumption is forecast to reach 4.4bn tonnes by the same date.with the highest carbon emissions of any major fossil fuel, coal is a huge contributor to climate change, particularly when burned in old-fashioned, inefficient power stations. when these are not equipped with special “scrubbing” equipment to remove chemicals, coal can also produce sulphur emissions – the leading cause of acid rain – and other pollutants such as mercury and soot particles.van der hoeven said that, without a high carbon price to discourage the growth in coal use and encourage cleaner technologies such as renewable power generation, only competition from lower-priced gas could realistically cut demand for coal. this has happened in the us, owing to the extraordinary increase in the production of shale gas in that market in the past five years.she said: “the us experience suggests that a more efficient gas market, marked by flexible pricing and fuelled by indigenous unconventional resources that are produced sustainably, can reduce coal use, carbon dioxide emissions and consumers’ electricity bills. europe, china and other regions should take note.”that would mean producing much more shale gas, as conventional gas resources are running down in their easily accessible locations.in europe, the emissions trading scheme was supposed to discourage high-carbon power generation by imposing a price on carbon dioxide emissions. this was done through issuing generators and energy-intensive companies with a set quota of emissions permits, requiring them to buy extra permits if they needed to emit more than their allowance. but an over-allocation, coupled with the effects of the financial crisis and recession, has led to a large surplus of permits on the market, which has in turn led to a plunge in permit prices. at current levels – a few euros per tonne of carbon – there is little incentive to seek out lower carbon fuels, and coal is enjoying a renaissance in europe.that means one of the world’s only regulatory market mechanisms aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions is failing in its key goals. the world faces the likelihood of an increased risk of climate change as a result of this runaway consumption of the highest carbon fossil fuel.
advanced	for 85 years, it was little more than a featureless grey blob on classroom maps of the solar system, but, on 15 july, pluto was seen in high resolution for the first time, revealing dramatic mountain ranges made from solid water ice on a scale to rival the alps or the rockies.the extraordinary images of the former ninth planet and its large moon, charon, beamed 4bn miles back to earth from the new horizons spacecraft, mark the climax of a mission that has been quietly underway for nearly a decade.alan stern, the mission’s principal investigator, described the images as a “home run” for the team. “new horizons is returning amazing results already. the data look absolutely gorgeous, and pluto and charon are just mind-blowing.”one of the biggest surprises was the discovery that “there are mountains in the kuiper belt”, the solar system’s mysterious “third zone” where pluto sits amid around 100,000 smaller icy objects. john spencer, a mission scientist, said the mountains appear to be around 11,000ft high and several hundred miles across. “these are pretty significant mountains.”the detailed image of one edge of the dwarf planet showed not a single crater, hinting that the surface has been recently “paved over” by geological activity, which could include dramatic geysers blasting plumes of ice into the atmosphere or cryo-volcanoes that erupt in explosions of ice rather than molten rock.in a nod to pluto’s former status as the ninth planet, until it was downgraded to a dwarf planet in 2006, the nasa press conference began with a rundown of spectacular images of the sun and the eight official planets. “we’ve brought what was previously a blurred point of light into focus,” said dwayne brown, nasa spokesman, as scientists and journalists waited for the image to be unveiled.stern described the images as “just skimming the surface” of what would be learnt about the planet during the coming year. they have already produced some surprises. scientists believe the mountains are made from water ice with just a thin veneer of “exotic” ices, methane and nitrogen. “you can’t make mountains out of methane and nitrogen,” said spencer.“water ice is strong enough to hold up big mountains and that’s what we think we’re seeing here. this is the first time we’ve seen this. the methane and nitrogen are just a coating.” the mountains on pluto are likely to have formed no more than 100m years ago – extremely recently given the 4.56bn-year-old solar system. this suggests the close-up region, which covers about 1% of pluto’s surface, may still be geologically active. the images are the first to show ice mountains outside of the moons of giant planets and raises the question of what kind of geological process could be generating the mountainous landscape.the structures, together with the smoothness of pluto’s surface, suggest that geological activity is taking place and smoothing over depressions caused by asteroid impacts. scientists believe this “paving” process could be the result of internal heat that softens rock and ice or from snowfalls that cover the surface. for scale, the images are so detailed that, if the craft were flying over london, we would be able to pick out the runways at heathrow airport.the distance to pluto – 5bn km – means it takes new horizons hours to send back a single picture and it will take 16 months to send all the data it has accumulated during the fly-by. the team also announced that the heart-shaped feature visible on pluto will now be known as the tombaugh regio, in honour of clyde tombaugh, who discovered the dwarf planet in 1930.the new view of charon reveals a varied, complex terrain. an area of cliffs and troughs stretching about 1,000km suggests widespread fracturing of charon’s surface, which could also be the result of geological activity. the image also shows a dramatic canyon estimated to be 7 to 9km deep.cathy olkin, a mission scientist, said: “charon just blew our socks off when we had the new image today. the team has just been abuzz. there is so much interesting science in this one image alone.” pluto is thought to be composed of about two thirds rock encased in a lot of ice, with surface temperatures of about minus 230c. as the £460m mission travels onwards into the kuiper belt, scientists hope that it will open up a window on the ancient solar system and the origins of planets, potentially helping to explain the formation of the earth itself.andrew coates, head of planetary science at the mullard space science laboratory, said: “these kuiper belt objects are the building blocks of the outer solar system. they’re all very cold – it’s like a cosmic deep freeze. it’s the best way of preserving solar system history. that is what is so fascinating about this. it’s a really thrilling time for solar system exploration.”in august 2015, mission scientists will choose which of two objects to visit next. nasa estimates that the spacecraft will be able to keep recording and transmitting until the mid-2030s. then, its plutonium power source will run out and it will shut down, drifting outwards towards the edge of the solar system and deep space beyond.new horizons also observed the smaller members of the pluto system, which includes four other moons: nix, hydra, styx and kerberos. a new sneak-peek image of hydra is the first to reveal its apparent irregular shape and its size, estimated to be about 43 by 33km. “new horizons is a true mission of exploration, showing us why basic scientific research is so important,” said john grunsfeld, associate administrator for nasa’s science mission directorate.“the mission has had nine years to build expectations about what we would see during closest approach to pluto and charon. today, we get the first sampling of the scientific treasure collected during those critical moments and i can tell you it dramatically surpasses those high expectations.”the observations also indicate hydra’s surface is probably coated with water ice. future images will reveal more clues about the formation of this, and the other moon, billions of years ago.
advanced	in canada’s arctic, summers are marked by a bright light that bathes the treeless tundra for more than 20 hours a day. for some, it’s a welcome change from the unrelenting darkness of winter. but, for the small but growing muslim community of iqaluit, nunavut, life in the land of the midnight sun poses a real challenge during the month of ramadan, during which muslims typically fast from sunrise to sunset.“i haven’t fainted once,” said 29-year-old abdul karim, one of the few in the city who has carefully timed his ramadan fast to the arctic sun since moving from ottawa in 2011. this year, that means eating at about 1.30am before the sun rises and breaking his fast at about 11pm when the sun sets. “the only reason to stop would be if it hurts my health,” karim said. pointing to his sizable frame, he laughed as he added: “but, looking at my condition, i don’t think fasting will hurt me.”as the end of ramadan draws near for muslims around the world, much of the holy month’s focus on community work, prayer and reflection has been a constant in communities around the world. but in iqaluit and the other muslim communities in the arctic, the long days have forced a shift in how the element of fasting is approached.most in iqaluit adhere to the timetable followed by muslims in ottawa, some 1,300 miles south of the city – following the advice of muslim scholars who have said muslims in the far north should observe ramadan using the timetable of mecca or the nearest muslim city. it still means fasting for some 18 hours a day, said atif jilani, who moved to iqaluit from toronto in 2015. “it’s long days, but more manageable.”many in the 100-strong community break their fast together, gathering in the city’s brand new mosque – completed in february amid temperatures that dropped as low as -50c with wind chill – for nightly suppers. as they tuck into traditional foods such as dates and goat or lamb curries, the sun shines brightly through the windows.it’s a scene that plays out across canada’s northernmost mosques during ramadan, as muslim communities wrestle with the country’s unique geography. the 300 or so muslims in yellowknife, in the northwest territories, have several options when it comes to fasting during ramadan, said nazim awan, president of the yellowknife islamic centre, with exceptions made for those who are pregnant or ill. “there might be some superhumans who want to fast for 23 hours, but the other option is to follow the intent and spirit of fasting by following nearby cities or they can follow the times of mecca and medina.”in recent years, much of the community has opted to follow the ramadan timetable of edmonton, in alberta. some, such as awan – a father of two young children, including a 12-yearold who recently started fasting – follow the timings of mecca. he hopes to encourage his son with the more manageable timetable of about 15 hours of fasting as compared with about 18 hours in edmonton. “if i fast yellowknife or edmonton times, my son might say, ‘papa, you are really insane. what are you doing?’” he said.faced with the impossibility of following the local movements of the sun, the 100 or so muslims in inuvik, a small town that sits 125 miles north of the arctic circle, have also been following edmonton’s timetable. “we currently have 24 hours a day of sun,” said ahmad alkhalaf. “there’s no sunrise or sunset.”the adherence to edmonton’s schedule was already in place in 2001 when he moved from toronto to the small northern community of 3,500 people. “my first ramadan here was in december. there’s no sun at that time; it’s dark all day and night. so we used edmonton time.”at times, it can be psychologically challenging to follow the clock rather than what is happening outside, alkhalaf said. “you’re supposed to break your fast when it’s dusk and we eat when the sun is out. it’s not usual to have iftar [the meal breaking the fast] when the sun is up,” he said.in inuvik, where much of the population is inuit, the muslim community has sought to strike a balance between ramadan and the local culture and traditions. the iftar meal includes dates and rich curries – as well as local game such as reindeer, prepared in accordance with islamic law. “we make a soup or curry … but instead of using beef, we use reindeer.”in iqaluit, as the muslim community prepares to mark the end of ramadan, some reflect that 2016’s timing – stretching across some of the longest days of the year – has made it one of the more challenging of recent years. it’s particularly true for those like karim who have determinedly followed the local sunrise and sunset. but, his efforts will be rewarded years from now, said karim, thanks to the lunar calendar. ramadan will eventually fall during winter, which, in iqaluit, sees the sun rise and set within a few hours each day. “i’ll follow those hours, too,” he said with a laugh. “oh yes, definitely.”
advanced	junior smart knows a lot about gangs. he is now 36 and his life can be divided into two distinct phases. he tells how in his late teens, after his mother died, he became drawn into a south london gang, which, at the time, helped fill a huge vacuum.“they became my new support group,” he says. “at first it was just a bit of fun but then it became more serious, more and more about making money. they got involved in criminality. that is how it was.” at school smart failed his gcses, then retook them at college and passed the lot. he secured a full-time job in administration and worked as a dj. but, on the side, he was making money illegally as part of the gang.eventually he was arrested for serious drug-related offences and was sent to prison for 12 years. instantly, he says, his sense of invincibility was shattered. “the first night after i was arrested was the biggest wake-up call of my life,” he says. “i had been living a dual life. i had been living as one person to my peers and another person to my peers’ enemies. i spent a long time sorting myself out.”today, junior smart runs a team of 12 full-time workers and six volunteers, which aims to turn young criminals and gang members away from crime. most of those working there are, like smart himself, ex-offenders. a few are still serving their sentences but are regarded as having reformed enough to be allowed out during the day to help. they work with the police, the probation service and other, voluntary organizations to help those who feel trapped and frightened in the violent criminal gangs that operate across london.for smart, the extraordinary journey from gang member to mentor began when he witnessed, from within, a prison system that was so obviously failing its inmates. he recalls a drug addict he befriended who, to his dismay, kept returning. “i was touched by the people who kept coming back in,” he says. “i couldn’t believe that nothing was being done about it. i was talking to the inmates and they knew what needed to be changed in their lives, but the problem is that the prison system only deals with the ‘index’ offence.”“one guy had a £300-a-week cocaine habit, which he funded through burglary. he would tell me stuff about how he would walk into a house, even when he knew people were there. so although he had a drug addiction, it never got dealt with. the thing that got me about that is that it is simply a revolving door.”that case and scores of others persuaded smart to start working as a prison “listener” – an inmate who helps reassure new arrivals and talks them through their first days inside. from there he developed what he calls his own “little plan” to run his own scheme once out of prison – using the experience of ex-offenders to help others reject the revolving door of prison life. he was released early, after five years. “at the end of my sentence i got an opportunity to put my little model into practice,” he says.so what does he think now? does he believe that, after the riots of last august, and the government’s promise to crack down on gangs, things are getting better? he is careful to offer some praise to the police and says much of their work in hauling in gang members has been good. but overall he is highly critical of a disjointed government approach that believes that, once the leader of a gang is arrested, the problem is solved. he agrees with the findings of a report that says the arrest of gang leaders can even make things worse. he says the effect of removing the leader is often to destabilize the entire gang.he draws a diagram of the hierarchy on a pad. “when you arrest the top guy, people start fighting for position all the way up. who was the most loyal? who had the most respect? it is a bit like a family. they are more likely to act out, through violence. it means that the arrest of the gang leaders has been nullified because it has not had a long-term effect. they have not even given the community a respite.”can it actually make the streets more dangerous? “it can do, because in the vacuum the recruitment and manipulation of young people becomes even more prevalent, creating new lower levels all the way down ... people take sides. if one gang or another territorial street network knows that an elder [leader] has been taken out, then they suddenly think that gang’s weak ... and so we have inter-estate disputes going on. and what happens when that elder is in prison? he forms alliances with other gang members, or when he gets released he then tries to retake control. that is when violence happens.”in order to spread risk down to the lowest levels, he says gangs are now recruiting far more in primary schools. the youngest members are called “tinies”. “over the last years we have seen more and more of this. the tinies can be as young as eight to eleven years old.” the young are brought in to shield their seniors from risk. it is often they who are charged with doing the street dealing or even the stabbing, he says.smart says that, with a lack of government funding and commitment to long-term rehabilitation, the challenges are immense, particularly in the current economic climate. “i try to engage a young person who has been earning £300 a week through illegal methods. it was hard before, to try to convince him. but with unemployment high and cuts to benefits, it makes things tougher.”that said, his project, which has well over 1,000 clients, is delivering results. fewer than 20% of those who come in for help reoffend. from personal experience, smart refuses to write off a single individual as beyond redemption and that is what drives him on. “i don’t think that about anybody,” he says.
advanced	scientists have implanted a false memory in the brains of mice in an experiment that they hope will shed light on the well-documented phenomenon whereby people ‘remember’ events or experiences that have never happened.false memories are a major problem with witness statements in courts of law. defendants have often been convicted of offences based on eyewitness testimony only to have their convictions later overturned when dna, or some other corroborating evidence, is brought to bear.form in the human brain, susumu tonagawa, a neuroscientist at the massachusetts institute of technology (mit), and his team encoded memories in the brains of mice by manipulating individual neurons. memories of experiences we have had are made from several elements, including records of objects, space and time. these records, called engrams, are encoded in physical and chemical changes in brain cells and the connections between them. according to tonagawa, both false and genuine memories seem to rely on the same brain mechanisms.in their work, tonagawa’s team used a technique known as optogenetics, which allows the fine control of individual brain cells. they engineered brain cells in the mouse hippocampus, a part of the brain known to be involved in forming memories, to express the gene for a protein called channelrhodopsin. when cells that contain channelrhodopsin are exposed to blue light, they become activated. the researchers also modified the hippocampus cells so that the channelrhodopsin protein would be produced in whichever brain cells the mouse was using to encode its memory engrams.in the experiment, tonagawa’s team placed the mice in a chamber and allowed them to explore it. as they did so, relevant memory-encoding brain cells were producing the channelrhodopsin protein. the next day, the same mice were placed in a second chamber and given a small electric shock, to encode a fear response. at the same time, the researchers shone light into the mouse brains to activate their memories of the first chamber. that way, the mice learned to associate fear of the electric shock with the memory of the first chamber.in the final part of the experiment, the team placed the mice back in the first chamber. the mice froze, demonstrating a typical fear response, even though they had never been shocked while there. “we call this ‘incepting’ or implanting false memories in a mouse brain,” tonagawa told science.a similar process may occur when powerful false memories are created in humans. “humans are very imaginative animals,” said tonagawa. “independent of what is happening around you in the outside world, humans constantly have internal activity in the brain. so, just like our mouse, it is quite possible we can associate what we happen to have in our mind with bad or good high-variance ongoing events. in other words, there could be a false association of what you have in your mind rather than what is happening to you.”he added: “our study showed that the false memory and the genuine memory are based on very similar, almost identical, brain mechanisms. it is difficult for the false memory bearer to distinguish between them. we hope our future findings along this line will further alert legislatures and legal experts to how unreliable memory can be.”chris french, head of the anomalistic psychology research unit at goldsmiths, university of london, is a leading researcher in false memories in people. he said that the latest results were an important first step in understanding their neural basis. “memory researchers have always recognized that memory does not, as is often assumed, work like a video camera, faithfully recording all of the details of anything we experience. instead, it is a reconstructive process, which involves building a specific memory from fragments of real memory traces of the original event, but also possibly including information from other sources.”he cautioned that the false memories created in the mice in the experiments were far simpler than the complex false memories that have generated controversy within psychology and psychiatry – for example, false memories of childhood sexual abuse, or even memories for bizarre ritualized satanic abuse, abduction by aliens, or “past lives”. “such rich false memories will clearly involve many brain systems and we are still a long way from understanding the processes involved in their formation at the neuronal level,” said professor french.mark stokes, a neuroscientist at oxford university, said the experiments were a “tour de force” but that it was important to put them into perspective. “although the results seem to imply that new memories were formed by the artificial stimulation (rather than the actual environment), this kind of phenomenon is still a long way from most people’s idea of memory,” he said. rather, he said, it was equivalent to implanting an association that perhaps someone cannot place but that makes them wary of a specific environment for no apparent reason. “it is unlikely that this kind of pairing could lead to the rich set of associations related to normal memories, although it is possible that, over time, such pairing could be integrated with other memories to construct a more elaborate false narrative.”the mouse models created by the mit team will help scientists ask ever more complex questions about memories in people. “now that we can reactivate and change the contents of memories in the brain, we can begin asking questions that were once the realm of philosophy,” said steve ramirez, a colleague of tonagawa’s at mit. “are there multiple conditions that lead to the formation of false memories? can false memories be artificially created? what about false memories for more than just contexts – false memories for objects, food or other mice? these are the once seemingly sci-fi questions that can now be experimentally tackled in the lab.”as the technology develops, said french, scientists need to think about its uses carefully. “whatever means are used to implant false memories, we need to be very aware of the ethical issues raised by such procedures – the potential for abuse of such techniques cannot be overstated.”
advanced	throughout a momentous day at liverpool’s anglican cathedral for the families of the 96 people who died so needlessly at sheffield wednesday’s hillsborough football ground, one phrase dominated above all else: the truth. these were the words most infamously abused by a headline in the sun newspaper, above stories which we now know, in extraordinarily shocking detail, were fed by the south yorkshire police to deflect their own culpability for the disaster on to the innocent victims.margaret aspinall, whose son james, then 18, died at what should have been a joyful day out, an fa cup semi-final between liverpool and nottingham forest, said the families had been forced to fight, for 23 years, for just that: the truth. aspinall, chair of the hillsborough family support group, said that, although the families’ loss would never fade, she was “delighted” at the unequivocal, “profound” apology given for hillsborough’s savage failings by david cameron.the hillsborough independent panel had inspected 450,000 documents generated by the police, sheffield wednesday and all other bodies responsible, and delivered its remarkable 395-page report indicting official failings and vindicating the victims and football supporters.some of what happened to cause the disaster, and the police’s subsequent blame-shifting, has been exposed before. but the depth of what the families call a cover-up, in particular the deliberate police campaign to avoid its own responsibilities and falsely blame the supporters, was still startling.in a concerted campaign – led, the panel found, by the chief constable, peter wright – the south yorkshire police put out their story that drunken supporters or those without tickets had caused the disaster. the victims had their blood tested for alcohol levels. this was “an exceptional decision”, the panel said, for which it found “no rationale”. when victims had alcohol in their blood, the police then checked to find if they had criminal records.the report, substantially authored by professor phil scraton of queen’s university, belfast, and unanimously agreed by the panel of eight experts, found there was “no evidence … to verify the serious allegations of exceptional levels of drunkenness, ticketlessness or violence among liverpool fans”.the report found that even as the nightmare began for the families of the victims, wright was meeting his police federation in a sheffield restaurant to prepare “a defence” and “a rock-solid story”. the secretary of the south yorkshire police federation branch, constable paul middup, told the restaurant meeting before wright turned up: “the chief constable had said the truth could not come from him, but had given the secretary a totally free hand and supported him,” as had many senior officers.the meeting was held just four days after the disaster. it was the day that the sun splashed its headline “the truth” over lies fed to it by four senior south yorkshire police officers. middup was encouraged to continue this police campaign of defaming liverpool supporters for supposed drunkenness and misbehaviour and “to get the message – togetherness – across to the force”.the panel’s report sustained the allegation made in parliament that the orchestrated changing of junior officers’ statements by senior south yorkshire police officers amounted to a “black propaganda unit”. the officers’ statements, presented as official police accounts to the subsequent inquiry, were changed to delete criticism of the police themselves on the day, and, largely, emphasize misbehaviour by supporters. the panel found that 116 of 164 statements were amended “to remove or alter comments unfavourable to south yorkshire police”.the police had claimed this was done only to remove “conjecture” and “opinion” from the statements, but the panel had no doubt the operation, to craft a case rather than deliver truthful police accounts, went further. “it was done to remove criticism of the police,” scraton said.this propaganda did not convince the original inquiry, which ruled as quickly as august 1989 that the police stories of fan drunkenness and misbehaviour were false, and criticized the police for making the claims. the report revealed that sheffield wednesday’s football ground was unsafe in crucial respects, that the football association had selected it as the venue for the match without even checking if hillsborough had a valid safety certificate, which it did not.in that landscape of neglect, it was the mismanagement of the crowd by the police, commanded by an inexperienced chief superintendent david duckenfield, that was “the prime cause” of the disaster. the police lost control outside the ground, where 24,000 liverpool fans had to be funnelled through just 23 turnstiles, so duckenfield ordered a large exit gate to be opened and a large number of people to be allowed in. his “blunder of the first magnitude”, according to the inquiry, was the failure to close off the tunnel that led to the already overcrowded central section of the leppings lane terrace.the inquiry report established this but the police, undaunted, repeated their claims to the subsequent inquest. its procedure was marked by the coroner’s decision not to take evidence of what happened after 3.15pm on the day of the disaster, thereby excluding an emergency response the panel found to have been chaotic. the finding that 41 of the 96 who died could possibly have been saved had the police and ambulance service done their jobs decently is damning of those bodies and, aspinall said, difficult for the families to contemplate.in the light of the panel’s report, the attorney general will now consider whether to apply to the high court for the inquest verdict of accidental death to be quashed and a new inquest held. there may be prosecutions too, after all these years, of sheffield wednesday, south yorkshire police and sheffield city council, which failed in its duty to oversee the safety of the football ground. trevor hicks, the president of the hfsg, both of whose teenage daughters, sarah and victoria, died in the crush, said: “the truth is out today. tomorrow is for justice.”
advanced	organic food has more of the antioxidant compounds linked to better health than regular food, and lower levels of toxic metals and pesticides, according to the most comprehensive scienti c analysis to date. the international team behind the work suggests that switching to organic fruit and vegetables could give the same bene ts as adding one or two portions of the recommended ô ve a dayõ.the team, led by professor carlo leifert at newcastle university, concludes that there are òstatistically signi cant, meaningfuló differences, with a range of antioxidants being òsubstantially higheró ð between 19% and 69% ð in organic food. it is the  rst study to demonstrate clear and wide-ranging differences between organic and conventional fruits, vegetables and cereals.the researchers say the increased levels of antioxidants are equivalent to òone to two of the  ve portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be signi cant and meaningful in terms of human nutrition, if information linking these compounds to the health bene ts associated with increased fruit, vegetable and wholegrain consumption is con rmedó.the  ndings will add to the controversy over organic food and whether it is better for people, with one expert saying that the  ndings were exaggerated. tom sanders, a professor of nutrition at kingõs college london, said the research did show some differences. òbut the question is are they within natural variation? and are they nutritionally relevant? i am not convinced.ó he said leifertõs work had caused controversy in the past. òleifert has had a lot of disagreements with a lot of people.ó sanders added the research showed organic cereals have less protein than conventional crops.the results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 peer-reviewed studies from around the world ð more than ever before ð which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit, vegetables and cereals. òthe crucially important thing about this research is that it shatters the myth that how we farm does not affect the quality of the food we eat,ó said helen browning, chief executive of the soil association, which campaigns for organic farming.plants produce many of their antioxidant compounds to  ght back against pest attacks, so the higher levels in organic crops may result from their lack of protection by chemical sprays. but, the scientists say other reasons may be important, such as organic varieties being bred for toughness and not being overfed with arti cial fertilizers.leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants òhave previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancersó. but, they also note that no long-term studies showing health bene ts from a broad organic diet have yet been conducted. the researchers found much higher levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, in conventional crops. pesticide residues were found on conventional crops four times more often than on organic food. the research was funded by the eu and an organic farming charity.the research is certain to be criticized: the inclusion of so many studies in the analysis could mean poor-quality work skews the results, although the team did òsensitivity analysesó and found that excluding weaker work did not signi cantly change the outcome. also, the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in conventional produce were still well below regulatory limits. but, the researchers say cadmium accumulates over time in the body and that some people may wish to avoid this, and that pesticide limits are set individually, not for the cocktail of chemicals used on crops.a further criticism is that the differences seen may result from different climates, soil types and crop varieties, and not from organic farming, though the researchers argue that combining many studies should average out these other differences. the greatest criticism, however, will be over the suggestions of potential health bene ts. the most recent major analysis, which took in 223 studies in 2012, found little evidence. òthe published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are signi cantly more nutritious than conventional foods,ó it found.this was also the conclusion of earlier, smaller studies published in 2009 in a scienti c journal and by the uk food standards agency, though the latter considered just 11 studies. the 2012 study did note that eating organic food might help people avoid pesticide residues. sanders said he was not persuaded by the new work. òyou are not going to be better nourished if you eat organic food,ó he said. òwhat is most important is what you eat, not whether itõs organic or conventional. itõs whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all. people are buying into a lifestyle system. they get an assurance it is not being grown with chemicals and is not grown by big business.óopinion polls show healthy eating (55%) and avoiding chemical residues (53%) are key reasons cited by shoppers for buying organic produce. but, many also say care for the environment (44%) and animal welfare (31%) are important, as is taste (35%). browning said: òthis research backs up what people think about organic food. in other countries, there have long been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming. we hope these  ndings will bring the uk into line with the rest of europe.ó
