intermediate	according to american researchers, a nasal spray containing the ‘love hormone’ oxytocin could help children with autism behave more normally in social situations. scans of autistic children showed that a single dose of the chemical improved brain responses to facial expressions. this is something that could make social interactions feel more natural and rewarding for them.the researchers said oxytocin might increase the success of behavioural therapies that are already used to help people with autism learn to cope with social situations. “over time, what you would expect to see is more normal social responding, being more interested in interacting with other people, more eye contact and more conversation,” said kevin pelphrey, of yale university.autism is a developmental disorder that more than one in 100 people have. the condition affects people in different ways, but leads to difficulties in social interaction and communication. so far, there is no established treatment for the social problems caused by autism.researchers at yale have studied the brain chemical oxytocin as a possible treatment for the social problems caused by autism because it plays an important role in bonding and trust. results have been mixed, though: one recent study found no significant benefit for young people given the chemical over several days. but pelphrey said oxytocin might help the brain learn from social interactions; it would work best when used with therapies that encourage people with autism to interact more socially, he said.the scientists scanned the brains of 17 young people aged eight to 16 with autism while they looked at images of cars or the eyes of people expressing different emotions. the scans were given 45 minutes after the young people inhaled a placebo or oxytocin through a nasal spray.the scans showed that the reward circuits in the children’s brains behaved more normally after a dose of oxytocin: that is, they were more active when the person was looking at faces and less active when looking at the inanimate cars. the study appears in the latest issue of the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences in the united states.“the study suggests that oxytocin might treat something for which we don’t have a treatment in autism, and that’s the core social motivation,” said pelphrey. he warned that it was too early to use oxytocin as a treatment for the social difficulties caused by autism and said people should not buy oxytocin online. “we don’t want them trying oxytocin at home. it’s impossible to say what they are buying. we are nowhere near thinking this is a ready treatment. it needs more follow-up,” he said. “this is an important new study in identifying changes in brain activity in key areas of the brain,” said simon baron-cohen, director of the autism research centre at cambridge university.a surprising finding, however, is that oxytocin nasal spray did not change performance in social recognition tasks. and, it is also not yet clear if oxytocin only has benefits for people with autism or has any unwanted side effects. finally, oxytocin effects only last about 45 minutes, so there may be practical considerations as to whether this could be used as a treatment.“from a scientific perspective, this study has a lot of evidence from animal and human work to justify serious attention, but more research is needed. doctors should be cautious about the potential of this hormone until we know much more about its benefits and risks, in much larger studies.” said simon baron-cohen.uta frith, who studies autism at university college london, said: “according to this study, oxytocin may have the effect of making faces more interesting. disappointingly, this effect is seen only in brain activity and not in behaviour. demonstrating an effect on behaviour will be critical if nasal spray treatment is to be of any value.”nan
intermediate	it is no longer legal to smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the worldõs drinking capital, new orleans, louisiana. many other cities have banned indoor smoking but new orleans is different ð it attracts tourists with a òlet the good times rolló attitude. an indoor smoking ban in new orleans could have unique consequences.since hurricane katrina in 2005, new orleans city government has begun trying to turn down the volume a bit. with the support of neighbourhood groups, the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly, while, at the same time,  ghting to implement a new ònoise ordinanceó.òthis is just the wrong time for something like this,ó complains bar-owner william walker, who hates the anti-smoking law. òforcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to increase the tension thatõs already there.ómany of new orleansõs best bars and live music venues are in quiet residential neighbourhoods. this neighbourly coexistence is a big part of what makes new orleans different and charming. but, recently, this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of new orleansõs musical personality feels at risk.martha wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music. òi bought the house partly because of the bar so i wonõt ever complain about the noise,ó says wood, who also manages a live-music bar. this bar became one of new orleansõs  rst ever bars legally banned from serving drinks to go, after a series of noise issues in 2013 ð including complaints about the loud smokers outside.the maple leaf club went smoke-free voluntarily in 2014. the same happened at another club where artists had been demanding smoke-free nights. òa lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so i wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesnõt host music,ó says zalia beville, manager of the all ways lounge.luckily, all ways has an outdoor patio, unlike lost love lounge, whose owner, geoff douville, loves the ban ð heõd previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar going. òthereõs no way i could have banned smoking in my bar without a ban throughout the whole city,ó says douville. òpeople act like i have that choice, as a business owner. but, if i make that rule, customers walk down the block to a bar with smoking.ómany small business owners also fear smoke- free revenue loss. smoker neil timms owns an english pub and met the smoking ban before, in england. òback home in england, every pub i knew closed within a year of the smoking ban,ó remembers timms of the ukõs ban, begun in 2007. he doesnõt want his pub to close so heõs spending money to build a patio.but douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity. òthere are lots of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar, with our food, but would never come because they didnõt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days ð weõre now an option for all those people.ó nor does douville worry about noise complaints: òno court is going to say a bar is a ônuisanceõ after the city has rati ed a smoking ban that requires you to go outside!ó he says.councilwoman latoya cantrell, who introduced the ban, disagrees: òthe responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their customers respectful outside as well,ó she says. òthe owners and bartenders need to tell them to go and have a smoke but be respectful to their communities. the idea that we canõt have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous. we can have clean air without noise problems ð i think itõs about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.ócantrell recognizes that the city is different. òhow is new orleans different from the rest of the country? new orleans is known as a place where you can relax and have fun,ó she says. ònew orleans needs to stand up and say ôwe care about our people.õ the most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions are the backbone of our hospitality industry, which drives the economy in the state of louisiana.ómany were worried that the police would not have time to enforce the ban. so the health department   will handle bar warnings and  nes. bar customers are encouraged to ò ll out a form or call 311 and to include photographs of illegal smokingó. for this reason alone, neil timms says heõll comply with the ban: òi donõt want someone to be sitting in the corner smoking and someone takes a photo and gets beaten up.óunworried, geoff douville says that heõs used to noise complaints by now. òyou will see: the nosy neighbours who complain about the noise now are going to be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban.ó in the end, douville shares cantrellõs optimism. òof course theyõre going to complain,ó he accepts. òbut it doesnõt mean theyõre going to win.ó
intermediate	the greek island of agios efstratios is so remote, so forgotten by the banks, the government and most of the modern world that there isnõt a single atm or credit-card machine on the island. before the economic crisis in greece, residents of this tranquil island in the northern aegean managed quite well. they did their banking at the post of ce and the few dozen rooms to rent were fully booked every summer with people who had heard ð by word of mouth ð of its spectacular empty beaches, clear seas and fresh seafood.but, because the island still uses only cash, the closure of the greek banks has been devastating. residents have to make nine-hour round trips to the nearest big island to get cash and greek visitors say they canõt get hold of enough money to come. òtourist numbers have reduced by 80% this year,ó said mayor maria kakali, in an of ce in the village where she grew up, with a population of around 200 people. òeven people born here and living in athens, who have their own places on the island, arenõt coming.ókakali has badgered the government and a major greek bank into promising an atm within weeks but she still feels it may be too late for this season on an island where tourism is the main source of income: òwe have almost no reservations in august, when usually we have people calling us up asking to  nd a room and we canõt help them.ó a hard winter ahead may be slightly improved because 50 workers will live and work in the village to expand the harbour. but there is an even bigger crisis ahead because the government has said it will end a tax break for islands.the tax break was created to help island communities survive the problem of mass emigration. the lower sales tax reduced the costs of living on the islands, where everything had to be imported and it made tourism more affordable. tourist favourites such as mykonos fear that losing the tax breaks will make it hard for them to compete with turkey. but, for agios efstratios, it is a far greater problem. òif we have to pay a tax of 23%, iõm sorry to say it but we will all die on the island,ó says kakali.food and fuel are already more expensive than on the mainland. even in summer the island has only three shops, two restaurants and not a single of cial hotel. òthis is an expensive island. everything, even milk or bread, has been bought and sold three or four times before it gets to us and everyone has to take a pro t,ó said provatas costas, a 58-year-old  sherman.for agios efstratios and its closest large neighbour, lemnos, the timing of the crisis is particularly cruel. they were seen as remote for years partly because you could only reach the islands by slow and unreliable ferries. in 2015, the government had  nally given the contract to a new, ef cient company and this has brought many new visitors to explore the islandsõ charms. but, then, the bank controls hit. òit started as the best season in 30 years and, in one week, it became the worst,ó said atzamis konstantinos, a travel agent in lemnos.lemnos has dozens of wild beaches, where you can swim and sunbathe virtually alone, a small nightlife scene and many cultural sites. it is the eighth largest island in greece so it is in line for the  rst round of tax increases in autumn 2015 but it is far less wealthy than many smaller islands. it has just over 3,000 beds for visitors, compared with tens of thousands on an island such as rhodes. òwe have been suffering economically in recent years and now we will suffer more,ó said lemnos mayor, dimitris marinakis. òwhen there is not enough money, you reduce your consumption and the whole economy gets worse.óif taxes go up, even more young people will leave, warns mayor kakali, who has worked to improve education on the island to help keep it an attractive place for families. because it is one of the smallest islands, agios efstratios has until 2017 before the tax rise comes in. kakali hopes that, because things change very fast in greek politics, the island might still avoid the tax. if not, though, she plans to travel to athens to remind the distant government what the tax rise would cost.òthe truth is the government doesnõt pay much attention to the islands of the north aegean,ó she said, òso i would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament, to tell them: ôthere is still life in these islandsõ.ónannan
intermediate	as soon as the children at one primary school in stirling, scotland, hear the words òdaily mileó, they put down their pencils and leave the classroom to start running around the school  eld. for three-and-a-half years, all the pupils at st ninianõs primary school have walked or run a mile each day. they do it at different times during the day and, despite the rise in childhood obesity across the uk, none of the children at the school are overweight.the daily mile has done so much to improve these childrenõs  tness, behaviour and concentration in lessons that many other british schools are doing the same. they are getting pupils to get up from their desks and take 15 minutes to walk or run round the school or local park.elaine wyllie, headteacher of st ninianõs, said: òi get at least two emails a day from other schools and local authorities asking how we do it. the thought of children across the country running every day because of something weõve done is phenomenal.one in ten children are obese when they start school at the age of four or  ve, according to the health & social care information centre, and, in the summer of 2015, a study found that schoolchildren in england are the least  t they have ever been. primary schools therefore accept the bene ts of the daily mile. it has been introduced in schools in various parts of the uk and other schools are planning to launch the initiative during the 2015-16 academic year. in stirling alone, 30 schools have already started or will soon start the daily mile.òitõs a common-sense approach to childrenõs  tness, which is free and easy. the most important thing is that the children really enjoy it; otherwise, you couldnõt sustain it. they come back inside bright-eyed and rosy-cheeked, how children used to look,ó said wyllie. at st ninianõs, teachers take their pupils out of lessons to a specially built circuit around the schoolõs playing  eld for their daily mile whenever it best suits that dayõs timetable. only ice or very heavy rain stop them.the extent of the bene ts isnõt known yet but researchers from stirling university have launched a comparative study to look for evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile. dr colin moran, who is leading the study, said: òthe children donõt seem to have problems with obesity; they seem happier and staff say they settle into lessons faster so we designed a study that would test all of these things.ó st ninianõs pupils will be compared with children from another school in stirling that hasnõt yet started the scheme.kevin clelland, a primary school teacher from leeds, visited st ninianõs and, then, convinced his colleagues it was a great idea. he said: òitõs such a simple thing to do but seems to have such an amazing impact. weõre really committed to improving the  tness of our pupils.ó his school is now building a track.active cheshire, a sports and  tness organization in cheshire, is taking a group of senior people from the local authority up to scotland to assess the results of the daily mile. the hope is to introduce it across the 450 schools in their region if a pilot programme is successful.paralympian, tanni grey-thompson, chair of ukactive, a health organization for physical activity, said: òall children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day, whether in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground. itõs fantastic to see initiatives like the daily mile, showing real leadership from the education sector to improve childrenõs  tness levels and their cognitive behaviour, and make a real difference to schools, teachers, parents and young peopleõs lives. we know sitting still kills; not sitting still helps children build skills that will stay with them for life.óthe scottish government also supports the initiative. a spokesperson said: òlearning in pe is enhanced by initiatives like the daily mile, which can encourage and support parents in fostering healthy habits with their children from a young age. we are pleased to see so many scottish schools are taking part or planning to do so.ó
intermediate	chemists have waited a long time for a new element to turn up and, now, four have been discovered by researchers in japan, russia and the us. the four new elements are the first to be added to the periodic table since 2011, when elements 114 and 116 were included. the new elements, all highly radioactive, complete seventh row of the periodic table and mean that science textbooks around the world are now out of date.the us-based international union of pure and applied chemistry (iupac), the global organization that controls chemical names, terminology and measurement, verified the elements on 30 december, 2015 after examining studies dating back to 2004. the scientists who found them must now come up with formal names to replace the latin-based temporary names – ununtrium, ununpentium, ununseptium and ununoctium – which reflect their atomic numbers, 113, 115, 117, and 118. the atomic number is the number of protons found in an element’s atomic nucleus.iupac announced that a russian-american team of scientists at the joint institute for nuclear research in dubna and lawrence livermore national laboratory in california had produced enough evidence to claim the discovery of elements 115, 117 and 118. the organization gave credit for the discovery of element 113, which had also been claimed by the russians and americans, to a team of scientists from the riken institute in japan. the decision means japan becomes the first asian country to name an element. under iupac rules, new elements can be named after mythological concepts, minerals, a place or country, or a scientist.when elements 114 and 116 were given formal names in 2012, scientists chose flerovium and livermorium respectively, after the flerov lab at dubna’s joint institute of research and the lawrence livermore lab in the us, where the elements were discovered. kosuke morita, who led the research at riken, said his team now planned to “look to the uncharted territory of element 119 and beyond”. jan reedijk of iupac, said: “the chemistry community is eager to see the table finally completed down to the seventh row.”the japanese team is considering three names for ununtrium: japonium, rikenium and nishinarium, after the nishina center for accelerator-based science, where the element was found. “they have been thinking about it for a while already,” said polly arnold, professor of chemistry at edinburgh university. “this is painstaking work. the work helps us with our models and with understanding radioactive decay. if we understand it better, hopefully we can improve how we deal with nuclear waste and things that are important in the real world. it also leads to fantastic technological advances in building the kit to make these observations.”along with new names, the scientists must suggest two-letter symbols for the elements. when iupac has received the researchers’ suggestions, they will go to public review for five months. that allows scientists and others to raise any objections. in 1996, the symbol cp was suggested for copernicium, or element 112, but it was changed to cn when scientists complained that cp referred to another substance.to discover the elements, researchers at the three labs slammed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for radioactive decays that should come from the new elements. ununtrium and ununpentium are thought to be metals. ununseptium could be a metalloid. the fourth element, ununoctium, may be a gas, like other elements, helium, neon and argon. it is hard to know for sure because so few atoms of each element have ever been made.paul karol, chair of the iupac panel that verified the elements, said: “it will be a long time before we can find practical uses for the new elements.”
intermediate	on one day in august, one in seven people on earth, 1 billion people, used facebook, according to founder mark zuckerberg. in ten years, the social network has completely changed peopleõs relationships, privacy, their businesses, news media, helped to end regimes and even changed the meanings of common words.òa more open and connected world is a better world. it brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society,ó wrote zuckerberg.these are just some of the ways his company changed everything ð for better or worse.1 facebook has changed the de nition of òfriendó òto friendó is now a verb. and, unlike in real life, it is easy to òunfriendó someone, a word invented to describe ending a facebook friendship when that person is no longer improving your facebook newsfeed.although the meanings of the words òshareó and òlikeó are basically the same, facebook has made the terms more important to us.school and university reunions are unnecessary ð you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and youõve seen pictures of your schoolmatesõ babies. you wonõt be surprised to see an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyõre dating someone else from the romantic sel es.but, unlike in real life, on facebook, all your friends have the same importance. a classmate from university who you havenõt seen for 15 years, a friend-of-a-friend from a party or a colleague youõve never actually spoken to in person ð they are all facebook friends in the same way as your closest friend or your spouse or your mum.it doesnõt necessarily mean we see them the same way. professor robin dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have about 150 people as a social group. facebook hasnõt changed that yet, he believes. but dunbar says he fears it is so easy simply to end friendships on facebook that, eventually, people may not need to learn to get on with each other.2 we care less about privacy the surprising thing is that facebook users happily hand over their information.pew research center found that most young people are more than willing to hand over their details. ninety- one per cent post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.but, because so much of a personõs life is shared online, facebook gives people a way to create an image and a fanbase. academics have described a new phenomenon: the òfacebook selfó.more than 80% of facebook users list their interests, which allows brands to target them effectively. but most younger users limit who can see their pro les, with 60% allowing friends only.3 facebook has created millions of jobs ð but not in its own of ces facebook provides indirect employment for people whose job it is to make facebook work for their brand.òit is a tool like no other,ó said michael tinmouth, a social media strategist who has worked with brands such as vodafone and microsoft. òmarketers have an understanding of a brandõs customers like they have never had before. the data available is extraordinary. you know who your customers are, who they are friends with and how they engage with your brand.óand advertisers pay a lot for that. facebook reported advertising revenue had increased by 46%, reaching $3.32bn.facebook is also a mine eld for brands. suddenly, customers donõt simply complain on the phone to a customer service representative or on a small specialist internet forum ð angry customers can post their complaints for hundreds of their friends to see or even on the brandõs own page.4 facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by facebook. manchester universityõs olga onuch found facebook had been the key way for reaching half of all the euromaidan protesters in ukraine. many of the people interviewed in onuchõs research said they relied on facebook for the truth about what was happening ð they donõt trust traditional media.5 facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news about 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63% of users overall, according to the pew research center. about a third of facebook users post about politics and government.most people will  rst read an item of breaking news via facebook or other social media, mostly on mobiles.facebook has also changed the ways journalists write stories. it is a resource many reporters cannot now live without. for better or (often) worse, it is a place to  nd information on almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly  nd themselves at the centre of the dayõs biggest news story.6 users are changing facebook it used to be a site for students of top us universities.in 2014, ten years after its launch, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a facebook account. and 39% are connected to people they have never met in person.more than ever, the site is a gateway not just to your friends but to the rest of the internet.we may as well get used to it, said david kirkpatrick, author of the facebook effect. òit might very well go away further down the road but something this big takes a long time to disappear,ó he told bbc radio 4õs today programme. òfacebook has proven its ability to change and it will continue to be a very, very major player.ónannan
intermediate	the world shares him and london claims him but stratford-upon-avon intends to spend 2016 celebrating william shakespeare as their man: the bard of avon, born in the warwickshire market town in 1564, who died there 400 years ago.stratford remained hugely important during shakespeareõs life, says paul edmondson, the head of learning and research at the shakespeare birthplace trust. òpeople often see shakespeare as someone who turned his back on stratford and his family, went to london to earn his fortune and only came back to die,ó he said. òbut stratford is where he bought land and property, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought. we are going to spend the year re-emphasizing the importance of shakespeare, the man of stratford.óthe anniversary of the death of the man from stratford, the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world, will be celebrated across britain and the globe. macbeth will open in singapore, romeo and juliet in brussels. shakespeareõs globe is completing the  rst world tour in the history of theatre. it has taken hamlet to every country except north korea. in london, they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema, one screen to showcase each of shakespeareõs plays.the national theatre, the royal shakespeare company and nearly every other theatre production company in the country will celebrate the anniversary. interpretations of the plays will range from the highly traditional to the experimental. there will also be hundreds of lectures, recitals, international academic conferences,  lms, concerts, operas and major exhibitions.for a man famous in his own lifetime, there is little documentary evidence for shakespeareõs life and times. the plays would probably not have survived if his friends and fellow actors had not gathered together every bit of every play they could  nd ð drafts, prompt scripts, scribbled actorsõ parts and 17 plays not known in any other version ð into the precious first folio published in 1623, seven years after shakespeareõs death.the actor mark rylance has called it his favourite book in the world and most of the surviving first folios will be on display ð including those belonging to the british and bodleian libraries, and a tattered copy recently discovered in france. some of the most precious surviving documents will be collected together in an exhibition at somerset house in london, including four of his six known signatures, which are all slightly different.the exhibition, by me, william shakespeare, will include his will, the court papers relating to the audacious move when shakespeare and his fellow actors dismantled a theatre on the north side of the thames and rebuilt it as the globe on the south bank, and accounts showing payments from the royal treasury for boxing day performances for james i and queen anne.the director of the globe, dominic dromgoole, recently jokily claimed shakespeare was a true londoner. stratford, however, will be insisting that the town made and educated shakespeare. they are restoring his old school room. it will open as a permanent visitor attraction.shakespeare bought the splendid new place, the second best house in the town, where he died, according to literary legend, on st georgeõs day, 23 april, the same day as his birth. òyou donõt buy a house like new place and not live there,ó paul edmondson said. òthe general public and many academics have consistently underestimated the importance of stratford to shakespeare.óedmondson believes that, after shakespeare bought the house in 1597, all his thinking time was spent there and that the late plays, including the tempest, were at least planned in his library and probably written there. the shakespeare birthplace trust describes new place as òthe jewel in the crown of the 400th anniversary celebrationsó.however, shakespeareõs house was demolished 300 years ago and the house that replaced it was demolished in 1759 by a bad-tempered priest, francis gastrell, in an argument over taxes. he had already cut down shakespeareõs mulberry tree, under which the writer is said to have sat and worked, because he was irritated by all the tourists peering into his garden.the gap where the house was has never been  lled. but the news that shakespeareõs kitchen had been found in the partly surviving cellars went round the world. the whole site is being displayed for the anniversary, with the oundations marked and the garden restored. òwithout stratford,ó edmondson said, òthere would have been no shakespeare.ónan

intermediate	illegal downloading is a kind of “moral squalor” and theft, as much as putting your hand in someone’s pocket and stealing their wallet is theft, says author philip pullman. in an article for index on censorship, pullman, who is president of the society of authors, strongly defends copyright laws. he criticizes internet users who think it is ok to download music or books without paying for them.“the technical brilliance is so dazzling that people can’t see the moral squalor of what they’re doing,” he writes. “it is outrageous that anyone can steal an artist’s work and get away with it. it is theft, just as putting your hand in someone’s pocket and taking their wallet is theft.”his article comes after music industry leaders met british prime minister david cameron in downing street to discuss the issue of web piracy.pullman, writer of the his dark materials trilogy, says authors and musicians work in poverty and obscurity for years to bring their work to the level “that gives delight to their audiences and, as soon as they achieve that, the possibility of earning a living from it is taken away from them”. he concludes: “the principle is simple, and unaltered by technology, science or magic: if we want to enjoy the work that someone does, we should pay for it.”pullman is writing in the next issue of the campaign group’s magazine in a dialogue with cathy casserly, chief executive of creative commons, which offers open content licences “that lets creators take copyright into their own hands”. casserly argues that there is a lot wrong with copyright, which was created “in an analogue age”. she writes: “copyright closes the door on the many ways that people can share, build upon and remix each other’s work, possibilities that were unimaginable when those laws were made.” she says artists need to think creatively about how they distribute and earn money from their work, quoting the science fiction writer cory doctorow, who said: “my problem is not piracy, it’s obscurity.”index on censorship agrees. the magazine’s editor, rachael jolley, said: “existing copyright laws don’t work in the digital age and risk criminalizing consumers. we need new models for how artists, writers and musicians earn a living from their work.”the debate is a lively one and the scale of illegal downloading is enormous. data collected by ofcom (the independent regulator and competition authority for the uk communications industries) suggests that between november 2012 and january 2013 in the uk, 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated, along with 52 million tv shows, 29 million films, 18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files.ofcom says 18% of internet users aged over 12 admit that they have recently pirated content, and 9% say they fear getting caught. pullman writes in his article: “the ease and speed with which music can be acquired in the form of mp3 downloads is still astonishing to those of us who have been building up our itunes list for some time.”following the downing street meeting, cameron appointed the conservative mp mike weatherley to be his adviser on the subject. a spokesman for the bpi, the record industry trade body, said: “mike weatherley is a strong champion of copyright and the artists and creative producers it’s there to protect. we hope his influence and the prime minister’s support for copyright will influence the approach of the uk’s intellectual property office.”nan
intermediate	the uk prime minister, david cameron, has declared a òclear resultó in the scottish independence referendum ð scotland voted by a 10.6-point margin against ending the 307-year- old union with england and wales. the prime minister promised a devolution revolution in great britain, as he welcomed scotlandõs decision to remain inside the uk. òthere can be no disputes, no reruns ð we have heard the will of the scottish people,ó he said in a statement.earlier, scotlandõs  rst minister, alex salmond, remained de ant at a scottish national party rally in edinburgh ð he said he accepted scotland had not, òat this stageó, decided to vote for independence. he said the referendum was a òtriumph for democratic politicsó and he would work with the government in london in the best interests of scotland and the rest of the uk. òwe have touched sections of the community who have never before been touched by politics,ó he said.the yes campaign won four big successes ð it won 53% of the vote in scotlandõs largest city, glasgow, 57% in dundee and 51% in north lanarkshire. however, the no campaign was victorious in 28 authorities. it won easily in areas where it was expected to do well, including edinburgh, aberdeenshire and borders, but also in areas that could have gone to the yes campaign, including the western isles. in the  nal count, the no camp won 2,001,926 votes (55.3%) and the yes camp won 1,617,989 votes (44.7%).in his speech, cameron made clear that there would be constitutional reforms, including in scotland, but not until after the general election. he also said that scottish measures would happen in tandem with changes in england. òwe have heard the voice of scotland and, now, the millions of voices of england must be heard,ó he said.cameron added: òthe people of scotland have spoken and it is a clear result. they have kept our country of four nations together and, like millions of other people, i am delighted. as i said during the campaign, it would have broken my heart to see our united kingdom come to an end. and i know that feeling was shared by people not just across our country but around the world because of what we have achieved together in the past and what we can do together in the future. so, now, it is time for our united kingdom to come together and to move forward. a vital part of that will be a balanced settlement, fair to people in scotland and, importantly, to everyone in england, wales and northern ireland as well.ed miliband, the leader of the labour party, said the referendum was a vote from the scottish people for change. òwe know our country needs to change. we will deliver stronger powers for a stronger scottish parliament, a strong scotland.ó but he said that would go beyond scotland. òwe will also meet the desire for change across england, across wales, across the whole of the united kingdom.ónick clegg, the deputy prime minister, said the referendum was ònot only a new chapter for scotland within the uk but also wider constitutional reform across the unionó. he said a vote against independence was ònot a vote against changeó. òwe must now deliver on time and in full the radical package of newly devolved powers to scotland,ó he added.yet that result raises the risk of further problems ð mps from cameronõs conservative party are threatening to vote against the prime ministerõs promise to quickly increase the scottish parliamentõs powers and protect its spending.the uk independence party leader, nigel farage, said cameronõs offer of more devolution for england did not go far enough. òthe english are 86% by population of this union. theyõve been left out of all of this for the last 18 years. we still have a situation where scottish mps can vote in the house of commons on english-only issues. i think what most english people want is a fair settlement,ó he said. cameron will try to calm tensions when he makes another statement on the result. the prime minister will explain how he will deliver further devolution to scotland, including giving greater powers over tax and welfare to the scottish parliament in edinburgh. the prime minister wants to move fast to show that the three main uk party leaders will meet the commitments they made during the referendum campaign.for the no campaign, there was relief: a number of opinion polls in the  nal days of the campaign had said the vote was on a knife-edge. this brought yes scotland within touching distance of victory after a dramatic surge in support.nannan
elementary	when pope benedict xvi was elected in 2005, he said he was “a simple, humble worker in god’s vineyard”. and on a grey, cold, windy monday in february, he resigned in the same way: like an old workman with pains in his back and no more strength in his arms. the first german pope in modern times gave an exact departure time. “from 28 february 2013, at 20.00 hours”, he told a gathering of cardinals in the vatican, “the see of rome, the see of saint peter, will be vacant and there will be an election for a new pope.”one of the cardinals at the gathering was a mexican cardinal, monsignor oscar sanchéz barba, from guadalajara. he was in rome for an official meeting. “we were all in the apostolic palace,” he said. “the pope took a sheet of paper and read from it.“we were all …” – sanchéz barba couldn’t find the word. the cardinals had just heard the man they believe is god’s representative on earth resign. “the cardinals were just looking at one another,” sanchéz barba said.angelo sodano, the dean of the college of cardinals, who probably already knew about the pope’s decision, gave a short speech. he told the pope that the cardinals would be loyal to him and added that he and the others present had listened to the pope’s words with a feeling of confusion. at the end of his speech, the pope blessed the cardinals and left. “it was so simple; the simplest thing you can imagine,” said sanchéz barba. “then we all left in silence. there was absolute silence … and sadness.”john thavis spent 30 years reporting on the vatican and has a book, the vatican diaries, that will be published soon. he said he had a feeling before that the pope was going to resign. thavis said that in the long interview benedict gave to a german journalist in 2010, he had said he would resign if he felt he could no longer do the job. “i asked myself: if i were pope and wanted to resign, when would i choose? he has completed his series of books and most of his projects. also, there were no dates in his calendar of events he had to attend. i thought the most likely date was 22 february but i got it wrong.”soon after the announcement, the vatican was saying that the pope’s decision was brave. thavis agreed: “what i find particularly courageous is that he is going now, when he is not sick; and that he’s leaving because he’s tired and not because he’s ill.” but is that the whole story? does the pope know more about his state of health than the vatican has so far made public?benedict said that he is resigning not just for physical reasons but also for psychological reasons. he said that the position of pope needed both strength of mind and strength of body, and in the last few months he felt that he was slowly losing that strength. there will no doubt be other theories in future days and weeks, just as there were following the death of pope john paul i in 1978, 33 days after his election. already people are saying that there was a secret in benedict’s past and that somebody was going to tell everyone. the vatican will no doubt say those stories are nonsense. but we can understand why some people think there might be a secret, because benedict’s decision is so historic.at st peter’s basilica, julia rochester, from london, still didn’t know what the pope’s resignation meant. “if you’re god’s chosen person, how do you choose not be chosen?” she asked. it is a question many catholics will be asking their priests in future weeks.
elementary	the last time she performed, we did not have mobile phones. now, 35 years later, as she performs again, singer kate bush sees a very different world.these days, most concerts are now lit up with phones and tablets, but bush does not want her fans to watch her shows through a screen.in august, before her concerts at the hammersmith apollo in london, bush asked her fans to put down their mobile phones at her gigs.bush wrote on her website: “i have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows. we have chosen a theatre, not a large venue or stadium. please do not take photos or videos during the shows.“i very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iphones, ipads or cameras.”bush is not the first singer or musician to say she doesn’t like phones at concerts. roger daltrey from the who recently said it was “weird” that people looked at their screen and not the artist on stage.he said: “i feel sorry for them, i really feel sorry for them. looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally – if you’re doing that, you’re 50% there, right? it’s weird.”in 2013, beyoncé told a fan, “you can’t even sing because you’re too busy filming. put that damn camera down!”recently, dutch football fans at psv eindhoven protested against the introduction of wi-fi in their stadium. they held up banners that said “no wi-fi. support the team,” and “you can sit at home.” manchester united have also told fans to leave their “large electronic devices” at home.singer jarvis cocker said, “it seems stupid to have something happening in front of you and look at it on a screen that’s smaller than a cigarette packet.”even in the world of classical music, one of the world’s top pianists surprised the audience in june 2013 when he left the stage because a fan was filming his performance on a smartphone. krystian zimerman returned moments later and said: “the destruction of music because of youtube is enormous.”but sam watt says that filming at concerts makes the experience even better. he works for vyclone, a phone app that puts together many videos uploaded by fans to create one long video of a show.“fans filming is now part of the concert experience – that is a just a fact. we take the videos that people are filming at concerts and mix them together with everybody else who was filming. the result is a really fantastic video,” he said.“we think that filming at concerts adds to the experience, and i think that, if kate bush came round for a cup of tea, we could have a really interesting discussion about this,” he added. “people are going to film and they want those memories – you’ve got to accept it.”nannannannannannan
elementary	when larry pizzi first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago, he asked: “why would anyone want to spoil a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it?”it’s a question that some people still ask. many bicycle shops in the us do not sell e-bikes.pizzi is ceo of currie technologies, the number one seller of e-bikes in the us. he believes that things will change very soon. other people who sell bikes agree. familiar brands including trek, raleigh and specialized all offer electric bikes and they believe that the market is going to grow.the us is different from other countries when it comes to electric bikes. nearly 32 million e-bikes were sold in 2014, most of them in china, where people mostly use them for transportation. they are popular in many parts of europe, too. they’re common in the netherlands and switzerland; german postal workers use them and bmw sells one for about $3,000.electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds, which use motors; you pedal an electric bike with – or without – help from an electric motor. riding an e-bike feels like riding a normal bike with a strong wind behind you; the motor just helps you go faster or climb hills. you can usually ride e-bicycles on bike lanes and they can’t travel faster than 20mph.e-bikes are banned in some states in the us, including new york. some bike shops don’t like putting motors on bicycles because it makes them too heavy. some e-bikes weigh nearly 30kg.e-bikes are also expensive. while cheap bikes sell for just $700, you will pay at least $1,500 for a quality e-bike with a good battery. the best bikes cost more than $3,000.but e-bike technology, particularly the batteries, is improving. “batteries are getting smaller, they’re getting lighter, they’re getting more reliable and they are lasting longer,” says don dicostanza, the ceo of pedego, an electric bikemaker and retailer.perhaps most importantly, more cities are building bike lanes so bicycle commuting has become more popular. electric bikes make commuting more practical – and fun – because people don’t have to worry about hills, strong winds, tiredness and sweat.most of our customers are “baby boomers who want to have the cycling experience they had as a kid,” says pedego’s don dicostanza. “the main reason they stopped riding bikes was because of hills.” pedego has opened nearly 60 stores in the us.electrobike has 30 stores in mexico. it opened its first american store in venice beach, california in 2014 and hopes to have 25 us stores in a year. ceo craig anderson says: “we want to help reduce traffic, help reduce our carbon footprint and encourage a healthy lifestyle.” he tells customers: “ride this bike once and try not to smile.”currie’s larry pizzi thinks that e-bikes will become popular in north america. “a lot of young people are using e-bikes for transportation, instead of cars.”there is even a cargo bike with a stronger motor and rack at the back. “you can carry two children,” says pizzi. “you can carry 45kg of shopping. it’s a minivan alternative.”nannannannan
elementary	felix baumgartner stood at the edge of space above new mexico and paused for a moment. it was a small step away from the capsule, but a 24-mile drop back down to earth. “our guardian angel will take care of you,” said mission control, and baumgartner jumped.ten frightening minutes later, the austrian landed back on earth. he fell at speeds of up to 725 miles per hour, and he broke three world records. he became the world’s first supersonic skydiver when he broke the sound barrier. “we love you felix,” shouted his team in the control room.he was wearing a special suit to protect him against the very big pressure changes during the jump. without the suit, a man’s blood would boil and his lungs would explode. baumgartner later said that all he could think about was getting back alive, but he also said: “sometimes you have to go up really high to see how small you are.”his other two records were for the highest altitude manned balloon flight and the highest altitude skydive. the jump was on a sunny morning in good weather. baumgartner went up into clear skies in an enormous balloon – it was 30 million square cubic feet and its skin was one-tenth the thickness of a sandwich bag. at the bottom of the balloon was a capsule, where baumgartner sat in his suit.at the correct height, baumgartner went through a checklist of 40 things with his helper joe kittinger. kittinger held the record for the highest altitude manned balloon flight before baumgartner. baumgartner had a problem with his visor. “this is very serious, joe,” he told kitttinger. “i can’t see when i breathe out.” but they decided to continue, and a record 8 million people watched live on youtube.the ascent, during which the skies slowly turned black, took two and a half hours. but the descent was much quicker. three cameras, which were attached to baumgartner’s suit, recorded his free-fall of just over four minutes and then the parachute opening.baumgartner has done lots of dangerous things before. he has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave. he did two practice free-falls to prepare for this jump – one from 71,000 feet and a second from 97,000 feet. but nothing can compare with his jump above the town of roswell, a place famous for its ufo sightings.he was trying to break five different records: the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free-fall; the highest free-fall altitude jump; the highest manned balloon flight; the longest free-fall; and his jump platform is probably the largest manned balloon in history. the jump beat two of kittinger’s records: before, the retired us air force colonel held the high altitude and speed records for parachuting. kittinger jumped from a balloon 19 miles above the earth in 1960 and gave advice to baumgartner during the ascent.someone asked him, “what do you want to do next?” baumgartner said: “i want to inspire young people. i’d like to sit in the same place in the next four years as joe kittinger. if there is a young guy who wants to break my record, i want to give him advice.” he said the most exciting moment for him was when he was standing outside the capsule “on top of the world”. he added: “the most beautiful moment was when i was standing on the landing area and mike todd [the man who dressed baumgartner in his suit] came and he had a smile on his face like a little kid.”baumgartner said that he felt like todd’s son. he said: “todd was so happy that i was alive.” earlier, todd said: “the world needs a hero right now, and they have got one in felix baumgartner.” this will be the last jump, baumgartner said. he has promised to settle down with his girlfriend, and fly helicopters on rescue missions in the us and austria.nannannannan
elementary	more than one million british workers might be employed on zero-hours contracts. this number comes from a poll of more than 1,000 employers by the chartered institute of personnel and development (cipd).recently, some uk organizations ð from shops to buckingham palace ð have been criticized for employing staff without a guarantee of work and pay each week. employees on zero-hours contracts often get no holiday or sick pay and have to ask permission before looking for extra work with another company.the cipd found that 38% of zero-hours contract workers describe themselves as employed full-time. they say they typically work 30 hours or more a week. one-third of voluntary sector employers use the contracts and one in four public sector organizations.the retail company sports direct employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on zero-hours contracts. other companies using the contracts include cinema chain cineworld and buckingham palace, which uses the contracts for its 350 summer workers. pub group j d wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff ð 80% of its workforce ð on zero-hours contracts.vidhya alakeson, from the resolution foundation, said: òif itõs true that there are around one million people on zero-hours contracts, then that would be a big part of the workforce.óunions say that employers put pressure on staff to sign the contracts. in this way, the employers can avoid their responsibilities to employees and reduce staff bene ts.dave prentis, of the trade union unison, said: òthe majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice.óworkers on zero-hours contracts are often only told how many hours they will work when weekly or monthly rotas are created. but they have to be available for extra work at short notice. they may get holiday pay, but they do not get sick pay.the charity national trust, which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts, said it gives the same pay and bene ts to workers on zero-hours contracts as to full-time staff.òwe believe zero-hours contracts are essential in our organization, because we are very weather-dependent,ó the national trust said. òitõs important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.ópolitician chuka umunna said, òwhile some employees welcome the  exibility of zero-hours contracts, for many, zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come,ó he said.the poll shows that 17% of employers in the private sector use zero-hours contracts, lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.industries where employers were most likely to have at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).nannannannan

elementary	people today might not hear the sounds of the natural world because they screen out the noises around them, says a us researcher.more background noise can make people oblivious to the uplifting sounds of birdsong, water and trees in the wind. you can often hear these sounds even in cities, said kurt fristrup, a senior scientist at the us national park service.the problem is even worse because people listen to music through their earphones instead of listening to the birds and other sounds of nature. natural sounds are easily drowned out by traf c, music and others noises, fristrup said.òthis learned deafness is a real problem,ó fristrup told the american association for the advancement of science meeting in san jose. òwe are training ourselves to ignore the information that comes into our ears.òthis gift that we are born with ð the ability to hear things hundreds of metres away, all these incredible sounds ð might be lost,ó he said.this is the problem: we hear so many noises that we stop listening.for the past ten years, the us national park service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 parks in the us, including yosemite in california, yellowstone and denali in alaska. there was noise from human activity in all the parks, for example aircraft, motorbikes, motorboats and tour buses.fristrupõs team say that noise pollution more than doubles every 30 years. òitõs not surprising people put on earphones,ó he said.òmore background noise has the same effect on your hearing as fog has on your vision ð you are aware of only a small area around you,ó he said. even in our cities, there are birds and things to appreciate in the environment but we are losing the ability to hear them.people quickly become used to changes in their environments, including more noise. fristrup worries that we will forget how much quieter the world could be. òif  nding peace and quiet becomes too dif cult, many children will grow up without the experience and i think itõs a very big problem,ó he said.other scientists reported health bene ts from listening to natural sounds. speaking at the same meeting, derrick taff, a social scientist at pennsylvania state university, said that listening to recordings from national parks, of waterfalls, birdsong and wind, helped people feel less stressed.òwe know that natural sounds are very important to people. they are some of the main reasons people visit protected areas. they want to hear the natural quiet, the birdsong, and the wind and water,ó taff said. òwe may be losing this as people are listening to their ipods all the time. my advice is to go to your protected areas and experience what you are missing.ónannannan
elementary	the small room looks like a classroom. the posters on the walls show letters of the alphabet and a map of bangladesh.but, it is hard to concentrate – there is the loud hammering and chemicals in the air that hurt the throat and eyes. but, the children who learn in this three-square-metre room are lucky. they have escaped working in the factories opposite.for 14 years, sohay, a non-governmental organization (ngo), has worked in slums in dhaka to send child workers to school. it especially tries to help children who do dangerous work.the classroom is one of 23 centres that sohay has set up in dhaka. the classes at the centres help children enter primary school. when they are in school, the children get extra help with their homework at the centres.alamin, ten years old, used to work in a plastic factory. he now goes to one of the centres. his parents are happy that he’s now in school and not doing dangerous work. his friend rabi says he wants to forget his past in the factory. “i like school,” he says.sohay also has classes for parents and managers to stop child labour. it can be very difficult for working children to go to school. they are not like other children. after they stop working, they sometimes find it difficult to make friends and adapt to school. it is also difficult to make sure they stay in school – lots of these children don’t finish school.seven-year-old zhorna akter sumayya has two older brothers – they both work (one at a restaurant, one at a local club). but, she went to a sohay centre and she now goes to school. her family live in the slum and her parents need the money their sons make but they want their daughter to go to school.in 2015, sohay helped 1,540 children to leave dangerous work and helped 2,125 more children – those who would soon start work – to go to school. about 780 more children are preparing to start school in 2017.the labour law of bangladesh 2006 does not allow children younger than 14 to work but unicef says that, in bangladesh, 4.7 million children younger than 14 are employed and 1.3 million children aged five to 17 do dangerous work.nannannannannannan
elementary	mcdonaldõs is the worldõs biggest burger chain and a symbol of american consumer capitalism. but, these days, the golden arches of mcdonaldõs are not looking so golden. the company has got much bigger since 2003 but, now, the numbers of customers are falling. mcdonaldõs says that its worldwide sales have fallen by 3.3%.the company has problems almost everywhere. in china, sales fell by 23%. in europe, sales fell by 4%, mostly because of problems in ukraine and the anti-western mood in russia. health inspectors have investigated around 200 of mcdonaldõs 450 restaurants in russia and they have closed ten restaurants.but the worst crisis is in the us, where mcdonaldõs has around 40% of its restaurants. almost 60 years since ray kroc opened his  rst restaurant in des plaines, illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a big mac and fries. sales have fallen every month for 12 months in the us. many younger diners are eating at rival companies such as chipotle mexican grill. the number of 19-to-21-year-olds who visit mcdonaldõs once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011.another problem is that mcdonaldõs hamburgers were recently named the worst in america in a poll of more than 32,000 american diners ð they said they would rather eat a burger at five guys, smashburger or fuddruckers. many people also believe that mcdonaldõs is less healthy than most of its rivals, especially chipotle. chipotle uses antibiotic-free meat and òlocally sourced, seasonaló ingredients.mcdonaldõs asked customers for their opinions in the us in october. someone asked òhave you ever used pink slime in your burgers?ó ð ôpink slimeõ is the beef  ller that is used for dog food. mcdonaldõs stopped using this meat product in 2012 but mcdonaldõs chief executive don thompson said the company still had to improve peopleõs opinions about the freshness and quality of its ingredients.mcdonaldõs has always had a reputation for fast service at low prices. but, since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, people think it is more expensive than its rivals and many consumers complain that service is slower.but mary chapman at food analysts technomic said that it wasnõt fair to say that mcdonaldõs was more expensive than its rivals. òprices have gone up but they havenõt gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-food chains in the us.ó prices at mcdonaldõs have increased by 4.8% since 2009, much less than the fast-food average (up 19.4%).but people are right when they complain that the queues are longer. mcdonaldõs has a bigger menu than some other restaurants, with more complicated items ð its chicken mcwrap takes 60 seconds to make. òi think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not,ó said chapman.mcdonald managers are promising to improve peopleõs opinions about its food in the us. thompson has promised more organic food and òbuild your own burgersó. but, to reduce queues, he also wants to introduce simpler menus. how can the company have simpler menus and, at the same time, a larger selection of  llings? òthey want to simplify the menu but also offer ôbuild your own burgersõ ð that sounds tricky,ó said consumer expert mark kalinowski. only four out of mcdonaldõs 14,000 us restaurants have tested òbuild your own burgeró, he said. òright now, we are sceptical; we would like to see more detail.ósales are falling but mcdonaldõs continues to expand around the world: by the end of 2014, it expects to open 1,400 new restaurants. kalinowski thinks that mcdonaldõs sales will continue to fall but he thinks it will be number one for many years.nannannan
elementary	a menu scandal at some of japan’s top hotels and department stores is damaging the international reputation of japanese food.one luxury hotel group admitted that it lied about ingredients on its menus. since then, there have been similar stories from restaurants run by famous hotels and department stores in japan.the story began when the hankyu-hanshin hotel group admitted that it gave false descriptions of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and october 2013.for example, the red salmon ‘caviar’ that customers ordered was in fact the eggs of the flying fish.the hotel group’s president, hiroshi desaki, went on television to announce a 20% pay cut for himself and 10% for other executives. but this did not make customers less angry.days later, desaki resigned – he said that the hotel group had betrayed their customers.so far, the company has refunded 20 million yen to more than 10,000 consumers. in total, they will refund 110 million yen.customers who believed they ate expensive kuruma shrimps were told they in fact ate much cheaper black tiger shrimps.complained in a blogpost that a ‘scallop’ dish he ordered at the prince hotel in tokyo contained a similar, but cheaper, type of shellfish.the hotel investigated the complaint and as a result corrected more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants. its report scared hankyu-hanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they, too, lied to customers who believed they were paying high prices for top ingredients.the hotel okura group – where barack obama has stayed – said they also injected beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly described tomatoes as organic.“we apologize for lying to our clients,” it said.the list of fraudulent ingredients gets bigger: orange juice from cartons that was sold as freshly squeezed; mont blanc desserts with korean chestnuts instead of the french ones on the menu; shop-bought chocolate cream that the menu said was home-made; imported beef sold as expensive wagyu beef.the menu scandal has come at the wrong time. japan is trying to persuade south korea and other countries to start to buy japanese food again after the fukushima nuclear accident.food industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 forced luxury hotels to save money.“menu descriptions were created to sound good to the customers, and, when hotels couldn’t get the ingredients on the menu, they just used food from different places,” hiroshi tomozawa, a hotel and restaurant consultant, told kyodo news.nannannannannannan
advanced	jmw turner, one of britain’s greatest painters, is to be the face of the new £20 note, following a nationwide vote.it will be the first time an artist has appeared on a british banknote, after the governor of the bank of england, mark carney, asked the public to nominate a deceased cultural figure they felt deserved the high honour.turner, renowned for his dramatic seascapes, beat off competition from 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, film-makers and actors put forward by 30,000 members of the public.the list included alfred hitchcock, alexander mcqueen, derek jarman, laura ashley, william morris and vanessa bell, which was then narrowed down by a panel of artists, critics and historians to a final choice of five.the final five – barbara hepworth, charlie chaplin, josiah wedgwood, william hogarth and turner – were selected on the basis of their “unquestioned” contribution to both the visual arts and british society as a whole, as well as their enduring influence.fittingly, the announcement of the new banknote was made at the turner contemporary gallery in margate, which stands on the former site of mrs booth’s lodging house, where turner would always stay when he visited. the announcement was made jointly by carney and the artist tracey emin, who grew up in the town.carney said it had been “so important to get this right and have a proper process that involved the public,” adding that, far from banknotes being purely a practical necessity, “if done properly, they can be a piece of art in everyone’s pocket”.“money is memory for a country and its people,” said the bank of england governor. “banknotes of the bank of england are a celebration of the uk’s heritage, a salute to its culture, a testament to its great achievements, including those of its most notable citizens. in short, money has not just economic value, it has cultural value as well.“the fact that we will have turner on the £20 note shows now that the british people are a nation of people who appreciate creativity and appreciate the arts,” said emin.the note will feature turner’s 1799 self-portrait, which currently hangs in tate britain, as well as one of his most recognizable works, the fighting temeraire, a tribute to the ship that played a distinguished role in nelson’s victory at the battle of trafalgar in 1805.emblazoned on the note will also be a quote from the artist – “light is therefore colour” – as well as his signature, taken from his will, in which he bequeathed many of his works to the nation.the new £20 note, which replaces the one featuring social philosopher and economic theorist adam smith, will enter circulation by 2020. this is the first time the public have been given a say over whose face appears on a british banknote.carney overhauled the process in 2013, following a high-profile campaign to ensure that women, apart from the queen, remained on banknotes, after the bank decided to phase out the elizabeth fry £5 note.historical figures were first introduced onto banknotes in 1970. turner joins winston churchill and jane austen as the significant figures who will feature on the new polymer notes – a plastic-type material that the new notes will all be made from – churchill on the £5 and austen on the £10 note. following in the footsteps of florence nightingale and elizabeth fry, the pride and prejudice author is only the third woman to be the face of british currency.turner was born in 1775 in london, the son of a barber, and he entered the royal academy schools at the age of 14. it was 1786, when he was sent to margate, that his love affair with painting and drawing the north-east kent coast began. he would return to that coast throughout his life and it was where he painted some of his most dramatic oils and watercolours, describing its skies as “the loveliest in all europe”.turner was a particularly prolific artist, producing more than 550 oil paintings and 2,000 watercolours over his lifetime. his life was also the subject of a film, in 2014, by mike leigh, with timothy spall taking on the role of the complex artist.victoria pomery, the director of turner contemporary, said: “the decision to celebrate jmw turner, one of the greatest technical pioneers in the history of british art, is extraordinary, not least because it has proven by a public vote that turner is the nation’s favourite artist. brilliantly, it is an official acknowledgment of the immense historical value of the visual arts to the uk.“but it is also a stark reminder that we must place increasing value on our future as a nation of creative minds. we must invest to support the next great artists and innovators.”
advanced	europe is to become the first place in the world to force ‘real-world’ emissions tests on car makers, opening up a new front in the fight to tackle air pollution. new regulations will introduce the tests to reveal what cars’ emissions are like when driving on roads and in traffic rather than in ideal, laboratory-like conditions, as is currently the case.green lit by european commission vice president, frans timmermans, the tests are designed to enforce a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre, a level met by only one car out of 16, according to researchers. other countries, such as china and korea, which are also considering real-world emissions tests, will be watching what happens next closely.pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and particulates are thought to be responsible for at least one quarter of the 29,000 annual pollution-related deaths in the uk alone. that figure is likely to rise, when the committee on the medical effects of air pollutants publishes what it calls “strengthening evidence” of damage to public health from nitrogen oxide emissions later in 2015.but the current ‘new european drive cycle’ laboratory test for measuring these emissions is a quarter of a century old and has been outpaced by technological developments in the car industry. studies have shown that the results of lab techniques to measure car emissions can easily be fixed by using techniques such as taping up doors and windows to minimize air resistance, driving on unrealistically smooth roads and testing at improbably high temperatures. campaigners say that car makers also use tricks such as programming vehicles to go into a low emissions mode when their front wheels are spinning and their back wheels are stationary, as happens in such lab experiments.“the commission is finalizing a proposal to introduce a new emissions testing procedure that will allow proper assessment of the vehicles in real driving,” said lucia caudet, a commission spokesperson. the proposal still needs approval from other commissioners and a technical committee but “we don’t expect any major internal hurdles,” a european union (eu) source added.“one key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 citizens annually is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars, causing many times more pollution on the road,” said greg archer, the clean vehicles manager for transport and environment. “the development of a new, real-world driving emission test is an important step forward in tackling urban air pollution. eu states should now support the commission’s proposals and ignore the whingeing from car makers that the rules are too tough.”according to research by the international council on clean transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg/km standard, with some models running at 22 times above the recommended limit. only one car out of 16 met the 80g target. around one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport – mostly diesel – and, in urban areas, concentrations can rise as high as 64%, european environment agency figures indicate.campaigners say that the car industry has tried to delay reforms to car test cycles but industry groups deny this, arguing that a five-year lead-time is necessary for technical and economic reasons. “real driving emissions (rde) is a totally new regulation that will force significant emission control hardware changes that may be demanded in the middle of a vehicle’s production lifetime,” said cara mclaughlin, a spokesperson for the european automobile manufacturers association (acea). “however, acea fully accepts that rde will apply to new types of cars from september 2017.”in an unusual move, the car association sent timmermans a draft regulation of their own for him to consider, after eu representatives finally agreed a regulation to implement the nitrogen oxide limits with beefed-up road trials and strict monitoring of exhaust fumes. acea’s draft regulation would have covered fewer pollutants and further delayed the regulation’s phased introduction until 2020. test distances would have been shortened from 1,300m to below 700m, minimum temperatures would have been raised from -7c to -3c and more rural roads would have been used. “the lobbyists were all over this,” archer said. “this was a real attempt at subversion of the legislative process.”after timmerman’s apparent rejection of the acea proposal, the regulation will now pass to commissioners for a rubber stamp, and member states for final amendments, before an expected introduction in september. by 2017, the first real-world car emissions tests are expected to begin in earnest. with a similar battle already looming over the testing of co2 emissions for cars at the end of 2015 – and with comparable debates in other countries – the introduction of the eu’s new emissions tests will be watched closely.
advanced	from all across rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring burundi, people  ock to the southern town of butare to a little shop called inzozi nziza (sweet dreams). they come for a taste of the unknown, something most have never tasted ð the sweet, cold, velvety embrace of ice cream.here, at the central african countryõs  rst ice- cream parlour, customers can buy scoops in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple  avours. toppings include fresh fruit, honey, chocolate chips and granola. black tea and coffee are also on sale.the shop, which has òice cream, coffee, dreamsó across its signage, is milking local curiosity about the dessert ð and òchanging livesó in the process, says inzozi nzizaõs manager, louise ingabire.òice cream is important,ó she says between mouthfuls of a honey- avoured offering. òsome rwandans like ice cream, but itõs a new thing. we still have some work to do, to tell others that theyõll enjoy it.ótrue to inzozi nzizaõs motto, the shop can certainly make dreams come true. òi didnõt have a job before: i just stayed at home. now, i have a vision for the future. i am making money and i can give some of it to my family,ó says the 27-year-old.butare, which has 89,600 residents and is located 135km south of the capital, kigali, is the home of the national university of rwanda. inzozi nziza has become a hub for tired students looking to treat themselves to something cool and different.òitõs something uniting people here,ó kalisa migendo, a 24-year-old agriculture student, says. òif you need to go out and talk to a friend, a girl or a boy, you come to inzozi nziza for an ice cream.ómost of the ingredients are sourced locally and the milk comes from a depot in nearby nyanza. the vanilla beans and cocoa are imported.inzozi nziza was opened by the theatre director odile gakire katese. she met alexis miesen and jennie dundas, co-founders of blue marble ice cream in brooklyn, new york, and formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010.òan ice-cream shop, katese proposed, might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits, hopes and family traditions,ó miesen says.at the start, miesen and dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative and non-pro t. they did not set  nancial targets, but waited for 18 months before they transferred their shares to the women, who had by then proved their business credentials.the shopõs success is no exception, says fatuma ndangiza, deputy chief executive of the rwanda governance board. òsmall businesses are mostly managed by women but when it comes to big business where you have to compete for big tenders, very few women are there. women are newcomers to big business,ó she points out. òwe have more women entrepreneurs. itõs an area where women are taking an interest, both in and outside kigali.óthough ice cream is somewhat new to rwanda, ndangiza is enthused by the idea of the shop. òi think itõs great. it requires a lot of skills and changing peopleõs mindsets because selling and eating ice cream is not part of our culture. i think being able to innovate and introduce this on the market, and the process of making it, is quite interesting.óthe butare shop employs nine women, who spend their spare time practising with ingoma nshya, rwandaõs  rst and only female drumming troupe, which was established by katese ten years ago.the musicians are hutu and tutsi women, some survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million tutsis and moderate hutus were killed.some members of ingoma nshya are widows, some orphans. others have been affected by the massacre in different ways.historically, says ingabire, rwandan women were forbidden to drum and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry. òbut itõs something which brings unity.óingabireõs father, two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide. òsome of us are survivors; some know someone who was killed,ó she says. òwhen iõm drumming with them, it gives me power because weõre still alive and survivors.óthe popular eatery features in a documentary by rob and lisa fruchtman, sibling  lm-makers. sweet dreams, which tells the story of how the women have forged a promising post-genocide future, also includes the female drummers.the  lm, which has been screened in more than a dozen countries, including the us, uk and several african states, premieres in rwanda in 2014. òwe feel the  lm is about resilience, hope, bravery, resourcefulness and the ability to change the course of your own life,ó says lisa fruchtman, who won an academy award for  lm- editing in 1984.
advanced	he is not the first person to express scepticism about mars one, a vastly ambitious private mission aiming to settle humans on mars from 2025. but joseph roche is different from most critics: he’s on the shortlist of astronauts.roche, an astrophysicist at trinity college dublin who was announced in february as among the 100 people in line for the mission, has written for the guardian expressing his grave doubts about the viability of mars one.the selection process, roche writes, “was not rigorous enough to reach the requisite standard of more traditional astronaut selection programmes”. he also says the dutch mars one team have displayed “a certain naivety” in believing they can succeed alone in the supposed $6bn mission and should now accept it is very unlikely to happen.he writes: “more openness and transparency would benefit mars one greatly but i think that the shortcomings of the selection process, coupled with their unwillingness to engage and collaborate with the scientific community mean that the time might have come for mars one to acknowledge the implausibility of this particular venture and turn their efforts towards supporting other exciting and more viable upcoming space missions.”roche also expressed worries about the way the mission organizers publicized a so-called top-ten candidates. the ranking, he said, didn’t mean these were the most likely potential astronauts but was, instead, based on how many “supporter points” each had earned through acts such as buying official merchandise.he writes: “these points are mars one’s supporter points which ‘represent the degree of your support to mars one’s mission’.” these points play no role in the selection process and serve only to show how much each supporter has donated to mars one.”the official timeline for the mission says the group plans to dispatch a stationary lander and satellite to mars in 2018, followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022. humans would start arriving in 2025 and crews of four would be sent every two years to add to the settlement. they would not return to earth.in february, a prominent supporter of the project, gerard ’t hooft, a dutch nobel laureate in physics, said he did not believe this timetable was realistic. he said: “it will take quite a bit longer and be quite a bit more expensive. when they first asked me to be involved, i told them: ‘you have to put a zero after everything’.”roche also spoke to medium, a us blogging platform that has previously expressed grave sceptism about mars one, reporting among other things that the supposed 200,000 applications to be astronauts in fact totalled 2,761.he told medium about the selection process in more detail: “i have not met anyone from mars one in person. initially, they’d said there were going to be regional interviews; we would travel there, we’d be interviewed, we’d be tested over several days and, in my mind, that sounded at least like something that approached a legitimate astronaut selection process.“but then they made us sign a non-disclosure agreement if we wanted to be interviewed and then, all of a sudden, it changed from being a proper regional interview over several days to being a ten-minute skype call.”roche told the guardian he did not want to give more interviews as he was wary about being negative about the idea of space travel.in his comment piece he writes: “i am passionate about pushing the boundaries of scientific endeavour and that is why the ambitiousness of the mars one plan appealed to me. although mars one were never likely to overcome the financial and technical barriers during their proposed timeline, it was refreshing to hear a new idea that challenges us to think about our own role in the future of space exploration.“being part of the subsequent public debate over the ethics and morality of future missions has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable aspects of my candidacy with mars one. if a one-way mission to mars ever became possible, then i would always volunteer. for an astrophysicist, that is not a difficult decision to make but it is also a moot point because i do not think we will see a one-way mission in my lifetime.”
advanced	not just the identity of the man in the car park with the twisted spine, but the appalling last moments and humiliating treatment of the naked body of richard iii in the hours after his death have been revealed at an extraordinary press conference at leicester university.there were cheers when richard buckley, lead archaeologist on the hunt for the king’s body, finally announced that the university team was convinced “beyond reasonable doubt” that it had found the last plantagenet king, bent by scoliosis of the spine, and twisted further to fit into a hastily dug hole in grey friars church, which was slightly too small to hold his body.but, by then, it was clear the evidence was overwhelming, as the scientists who carried out the dna tests, those who created the computer-imaging technology to peer onto and into the bones in extraordinary detail, the genealogists who found a distant descendant with matching dna, and the academics who scoured contemporary texts for accounts of the king’s death and burial outlined their findings.“what a morning. what a story,” said philippa langley, of the richard iii society. she had been driving on the project for years, in the face of incredulity from many people, and finding funds from all over the world when it looked as if the money would run out before the excavation had even begun.work has started on designing a new tomb in leicester cathedral, only 100 yards from the excavation site, and a ceremony will be held to lay him into his new grave there, probably next year. leicester’s museums’ service is working on plans for a new visitor centre in an old school building overlooking the site.richard died at bosworth on 22 august 1485, the last english king to fall in battle, and the researchers revealed how for the first time. there was an audible intake of breath as a slide came up showing the base of his skull sliced off by one terrible blow, believed to be from a halberd, a fearsome medieval battle weapon with a razor-sharp iron axe blade weighing about two kilos, mounted on a wooden pole, which was swung at richard at very close range. the blade probably penetrated several centimetres into his brain and, said the human bones expert jo appleby, he would have been unconscious at once and dead almost as soon.the injury appears to confirm contemporary accounts that he died in close combat in the thick of the battle and unhorsed – as in the great despairing cry shakespeare gives him: “a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!” another sword slash, which also went through the bone and into the brain, would also have proved fatal. but many of the other injuries were after death, suggesting a gruesome ritual on the battlefield and as the king’s body was brought back to leicester, as he was stripped, mocked and mutilated.one terrible injury, a stab through the right buttock and into his pelvis, was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour. it suggests the story that his naked corpse was brought back slung over a horse, mocked and abused all the way, is true. bob savage, a medieval arms expert from the royal armouries who helped identify the wounds, said it was probably not a war weapon but the sort of sharp knife or dagger any workman might have carried.michael ibsen, the canadian-born furniture maker proved to be the descendant of richard’s sister, heard the confirmation on sunday and listened to the unfolding evidence in shocked silence. “my head is no clearer now than when i first heard the news,” he said. “many, many hundreds of people died on that field that day. he was a king, but just one of the dead. he lived in very violent times and these deaths would not have been pretty or quick.”it was mathew morris who first uncovered the body, in the first hour of the first day of the excavation. he did not believe he had found the king. the mechanical digger was still chewing the tarmac off the council car park, identified by years of research by local historians and the richard iii society as the probable site of the lost church of grey friars, whose priests bravely claimed the body of the king and buried him in a hastily dug grave, probably still naked, but in a position of honour near the high altar of their church. the leg bones just showing through the soil were covered up again.ten days later, on 5 september, when further excavation proved morris had hit the crucial spot, he returned with lin foxhall, head of the archaeology department, to excavate the body. “we did it the usual way, lifting the arms, legs and skull first, and proceeding gradually towards the torso – so it was only when we finally saw the twisted spine that i thought: ‘my word, i think we’ve got him.’”as far as langley is concerned, richard was the true king, the last king of the north, a worthy and brave leader who became a victim of some of the most brilliant propaganda in history, in the hands of the tudors’ imagemaker, shakespeare. there remains the dark shadow of the little princes in the tower, an infamous story even in richard’s day: the child edward v and his brother richard were declared illegitimate when richard iii claimed the throne, imprisoned in the tower of london and never seen alive again. although it is by no means certain that the bones found at the tower centuries later are theirs, there may be more dna detective work to be done there.

boston is 34th. canadian cities, led by vancouver, far outrank their us rivals in the table.òyou donõt realize how safe vienna is until you head abroad,ó said hartlauer. òwe also have terri c public transport, with the underground working 24 hours at weekends, and it only costs û1 per trip.óvienna bene ted enormously from the fall of the berlin wall, becoming the gateway to eastern european countries that often have historic ties to the former austro-hungarian empire.òour big usp is our geographical location,ó said martin eichtinger, austrian ambassdaor to london, who lived in vienna for 20 years. òthe fall of the berlin wall helped de ne vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in central europe.óaccording to the world bank, austria has one of the highest  gures for gdp per head in the world, just behind the us and ahead of germany and britain, although quite some way below neighbouring switzerland.zurich in switzerland is named by mercer as having the worldõs second highest quality of life but the viennese say their city is far more fun. òthere are more students in vienna than any other german-speaking city,ó said hartlauer. òitõs a very fast growing, young and lively city,ó she added ð though she conceded she works for the cityõs tourist board.vienna has long been overlooked by british weekend city break tourists, who instead  ock to barcelona or berlin and tend to think of austria as somewhere for skiing, lakes and mountains.but, after an increase in budget  ights from regional british cities such as manchester and edinburgh, vienna is fast catching up as a popular destination. in 2015, there were 588,000 british visitors to vienna, up 18% on the year before. the  ow is both ways; eichtinger said london has become the number one city destination for austrian visitors.òvienna has ranked top in the last seven published rankings,ó said mercer. òit scores highly in a number of categories; it provides a safe and stable environment to live in, a high level of public utilities and transport facilities and good recreational facilities.óthe european migrant crisis, which has seen large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers pass through vienna en route to germany, has had little impact on the city of nearly 1.8 million people, said eichtinger. òwe have managed to accommodate 90,000 refugees in austria but the numbers have slowed in recent months.ólondon has never been in the quality-of-life top ten, says mercer, damaged by its poor scores for air pollution, traf c congestion and climate. after london, edinburgh is the next-ranking british city, in 46th place.paris has suffered the biggest fall in the most recent rankings. òparis remained stable for several years but has, this year, dropped ten places in the overall ranking,ó said mercer.òthe drop was essentially due to the terrorist attacks in 2015. however, it is important to highlight that safety issues are a very highly weighted factor within the ôbasketõ so any small adjustments can have a big impact on the ranking.óauckland in new zealand was the highest ranking english-speaking city in the survey, in third place, followed by vancouver in  fth. australian cities also perform very highly in the survey, with sydney 10th and melbourne 15th. the economist has consistently ranked melbourne as the worldõs most liveable city, although its survey has been criticized as too anglocentric.war and political unrest are behind all the worst-ranked cities in the world. surprisingly, damascus is named as only the seventh worst, ranked better than not just baghdad but also bangui in central african republic, sanaõa in yemen, port-au-prince in haiti, khartoum in sudan and nõdjamena in chad.
advanced	an international agreement to improve safety in bangladesh’s clothing factories is facing the threat of legal action as factory owners demand compensation for the cost of closures and repair work. with some repair programmes expected to take months, factory owners say they cannot shoulder the costs of paying staff while factories are closed, alongside the expense of some major works needed to ensure buildings are safe. the building overhauls are being carried out in the wake of the collapse of the rana plaza complex in the capital of bangladesh, dhaka, in 2013, in which 1,138 people were killed.the problems come as hundreds of bangladeshi clothing factories per month are inspected for firesafety and structural problems under the accord on fire and building safety in bangladesh, which is backed by over 170 international brands, including primark and marks & spencer, and international trade unions, including industriall.the owner of one dhaka-based factory, softex cotton, has threatened legal action against the accord after his factory was closed down due to structural problems, prompting a demand for a reported $100m in compensation.another factory owner, who declined to be named, said that once a factory closed its doors, even for a few months, it would lose orders and close permanently: “there is no such thing as temporary closure,” he said. the factory owner said that the accord agreement had “pussyfooted” around the issue of who paid for factory closures amid efforts to get as many brands as possible to sign up to a deal in the wake of the rana plaza disaster. he said there was no clear process in place to handle the costs involved.jenny holdcroft, policy director for industriall, which has been closely involved in the accord, said that the agreement ensured that factories would not lose orders during closure because brands had committed to maintain orders with suppliers for two years.while 12 factories have been identified so far by the accord as needing significant work, holdcroft said many of those only needed partial closure in order to reduce stress on the building so production could continue on other floors. the accord also legally binds brands to ensure that workers are paid during factory closures. she said the detail on who would make payments had been left open in order to ensure that all those factory owners who could afford to pay for repairs and compensation for workers made the necessary contribution.“this was always going to be a topic of negotiation. brands don’t want to commit to paying so that rich factory owners who have just pocketed the profits and not been spending on their factories for years continue to do so. there was obviously going to be disruption. if there was no disruption, there would be no change,” she said. a spokesman for the accord said negotiations over payments and even legal action would not hold up its work to improve safety in factories.however, pressure on the accord to contribute to the payment of displaced workers has ratcheted up after a rival factory-safety group backed by us retailers including walmart and gap, the alliance for bangladesh worker safety, set aside $5m to help pay factory workers for up to two months while work is carried out on the buildings it has identified as needing improvement. it has, so far, identified five factories in four buildings where production needed to be suspended.“the alliance is sharing the workers’ salary along with entrepreneurs so now there is a big confusion. we had a big meeting with the accord to make them understand they have to come forward or how will we help our workers?” said shaidullah azim, a director of the bangladeshi garment manufacturers and exporters association.
advanced	they are the darkness seekers – and they are growing in number. on black fell, looking down on northumberland’s beautiful kielder water reservoir, a group of people wait in a car park next to a strange wooden building with a minimalist design beamed down from the future. this is kielder observatory, the centre of britain’s nascent astrotourism industry. and those waiting outside were the lucky ones. many more had applied for a night of stargazing at the observatory but numbers are strictly limited.inside, next to a woodburner and under dimmed lights, the observatory’s founder and lead astronomer, gary fildes, a former bricklayer with tarzan hair, delivers a pep talk to his colleagues and volunteers. the team discusses the prospect of seeing the northern lights but fildes is doubtful. instead, they decide to train their powerful telescopes on jupiter and venus and later to pick out stars such as capella and betelgeuse. an additional attraction is the appearance of the international space station.“remember,” fildes tells his team, “it’s about interaction, it’s about entertainment, it’s about inspiring people.” he puts on some music. pink floyd, the jam, the pogues. “by 9.30, the sky is going to be sexy,” fildes says. “it’s going to be epic.”fildes, 49, is at the forefront of the uk’s burgeoning astrotourism industry. the pivotal moment for northumberland came in 2013 when the entire national park housing hadrian’s wall, along with kielder water and forest park, some 1,500 sq km, was awarded dark sky park status, the only one in england. dark sky parks are rare. the 2013 star count revealed that only 5% of the uk population can see more than 31 stars on a good night.the tucson, arizona-based international dark-sky association (ida) confers the status only on places that take major steps to avoid light pollution. recipients must also prove their night skies are sufficiently dark. in northumberland dark sky park, as the area was rebadged, it is so dark that venus casts a shadow on the earth.duncan wise, visitor development officer for the northumberland national park authority, helped to spearhead the campaign for dark-sky status after the council for the protection of rural england found it was one of britain’s most tranquil places. “we tend to look at landscape as everything up to the horizon,” wise said. “but what about what’s above it?” wise and others spent years drawing up their submission to the ida, collecting reams of light readings and forming an alliance of local councils, parks’ bodies and community groups to produce an exterior lighting master plan that influences the construction of new developments in the area.their efforts have been vindicated. many of the 1.5 million who visit northumberland each year are now aware of its dark sky status. “we get a lot of people coming here to see the sky now,” says the man at the car-hire firm in newcastle. “they come in autumn and winter, when it’s darkest. good for the b&bs as they get business all year round now.” local hoteliers now issue guests with night-vision torches and put out deckchairs at night. those who have acquired some knowledge of astronomy can receive a badge confirming that their hotels are “dark sky friendly”.wise acknowledges that northumberland needs to do more to capitalize on its scarce resource and believes the region needs a couple more observatories to ensure that visitors will see what they came for. a £14m national landscape discovery centre, which he describes as the north’s answer to the eden project, will have an observatory when it is completed in a couple of years.fildes has grand designs. he is planning britain’s first “astrovillage”, one that would house the largest public observatory in the world and boast a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, a one-metre aperture telescope, and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes. the multimillion-pound project would feature a hotel and draw in 100,000 people a year, four times the number currently able to use the observatory. fildes is cryptic about his backers but believes the astrovillage will be a reality by 2018.however, northumberland faces competition. galloway forest park in scotland also has dark sky park status. since exmoor was designated europe’s first international dark sky reserve – one notch below dark sky park – in 2011, a range of local businesses offering stargazing breaks and safaris has sprung up. the uk will have to go some way to eclipse northern chile, which boasts more than a dozen tourist observatories and has some of the clearest skies in the world. the teide national park in tenerife is also becoming a major astrotourism destination.so, what is driving the desire to look upwards? the media have helped. tv presenters like brian cox have attracted a new generation of stargazers. “brian cox has made astronomy accessible,” says wise. “it’s no longer seen as the province of professors in studies with brass telescopes.” technology has also played a part. apps such as stellarium now turn smartphones into pocket-size planetariums. ultimately, though, fildes believes people are starting to appreciate what lies above. “if you had to build a visitor attraction from scratch, what could be better than the universe?”
advanced	margaret thatcher, the most dominant british prime minister since winston churchill in 1940 and a global champion of the late 20th-century free market economic revival, has died. the british government announced that she would receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours at st paul’s cathedral.the british prime minister, david cameron, who is cutting short his trip to europe to return to london following the news, said: “it was with great sadness that l learned of lady thatcher’s death. we’ve lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great briton.” he added: “as our first woman prime minister, margaret thatcher succeeded against all the odds, and the real thing about margaret thatcher is that she didn’t just lead our country, she saved our country, and i believe she will go down as the greatest british peacetime prime minister.”in a statement, president barack obama said, “here in america, many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with president reagan, reminding the world that we are not simply carried along by the currents of history – we can shape them with moral conviction, unyielding courage and iron will.”the first woman elected to lead a major western state, lady thatcher, as she became after the longest premiership since 1827, served 11 unbroken years at no 10 downing street.thatcher, who was 87, had been in declining health for some years, suffering from dementia. after a series of mini-strokes in 2002, thatcher withdrew from public life, no longer able to make the kind of waspish pronouncements that had been her forte in office – and beyond.her death was greeted with tributes from across the political spectrum.as labour sources announced the party would suspend campaigning in local elections as a mark of respect, its leader, ed miliband, said: “she will be remembered as a unique figure. she reshaped the politics of a whole generation. she was britain’s first woman prime minister. she moved the centre ground of british politics and was a huge figure on the world stage. the labour party disagreed with much of what she did and she will always remain a controversial figure. but we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength.”the deputy prime minister, nick clegg, said: “margaret thatcher was one of the defining figures in modern british politics. whatever side of the political debate you stand on, no one can deny that as prime minister she left a unique and lasting imprint on the country she served.”describing her as a political phenomenon, the former tory prime minister sir john major said: “her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.”the “iron lady” proved a significant cold war ally of the us president ronald reagan in the final showdown with the soviet union, which broke up under reformist pressures led by mikhail gorbachev, a kremlin leader with whom thatcher famously declared she could “do business”. as a result, many ordinary voters in ex-soviet bloc states saw her as a bold champion of their liberty, a view widely shared across the spectrum of mainstream us opinion – though not at home or among key eu partners.thatcher was an unremarkable mid-ranking conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975. within a decade, she had become known around the world – both admired and detested – for her pro-market domestic reforms and her implacable attitudes in foreign policy, including her long-running battle with the ira, which almost managed to murder her when it placed a bomb in the grand hotel, brighton, in 1984.at home, the emerging doctrine of thatcherism meant denationalization of state-owned industry – the new word “privatization” came into widespread use in many countries – and defeat of militant trade unionists, notably the national union of miners, whose year-long strike (1984– 85) was bitter and traumatic.boosted by the newly arrived revenues from britain’s north sea oil fields, thatcher had room to manoeuvre and change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies – including moderate members of her own party.but she also deployed her notorious “handbaggings”, or verbal attacks, in the european union to obtain a british rebate – “my money” as she called it. she was less successful in fending off the centralizing ambitions of the “belgian empire”, her description of the european commission, especially in the years when it was headed by the french socialist jacques delors.her allies in the tabloid press egged her on. and, as the british economy recovered from the severe recession that her monetarist medicine had inflicted on it – to tame the unions and cure inflation – she briefly seemed invincible.but untrammelled power, with the defeat or retirement of allies who had kept her in check, led to mistakes and growing unpopularity. when sir geoffrey howe, nominally her deputy, finally fell out with thatcher – chiefly over europe – his devastating resignation speech triggered a leadership challenge. thatcher made way for john major rather than risk losing to him in a ballot.in retirement, she wrote highly successful memoirs in two volumes and
