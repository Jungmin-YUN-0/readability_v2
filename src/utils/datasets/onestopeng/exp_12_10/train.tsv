intermediate	according to a new census, there are more tigers in nepal than at any time since the 1970s. this has given conservationists hope that the big cats, whose numbers have been dropping across south asia for 100 years, can be saved.the number of wild royal bengal tigers in nepal has increased to 198 – a 63.6% rise in five years – the government survey showed. “this is very good news,” said maheshwar dhakal, an ecologist with nepal’s department of national parks and wildlife conservation.the census is based on the examination of pictures from more than 500 cameras in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors. more than 250 conservationists and wildlife experts worked on the survey, which cost about £250,000. dhakal said that a similar survey was done in india and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013. “it will take a few more months for india, which now has 1,300 big cats in several huge protected areas, to finish the survey,” he added. nepal has promised to double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 when the last systematic tiger count took place.increasing wealth in asia has led to higher prices for tiger skins and the body parts used in traditional chinese medicines. international gangs pay poor local nepali large amounts of money to kill the cats. the skin and bones are given to middlemen, who pass easily through the border with india, where the major dealers are based.one major problem is that some senior officials help mafia networks involved in the trade. conservation experts believe that the increase in tiger numbers is the result of better policing of national parks and better management of tiger habitats in nepal, where forests cover 29% of the land. but they say nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers feed so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat.as the number of tigers has increased over the years, conflict with villagers has increased, too. seven people were killed in attacks by tigers around national parks in 2012 compared to four in 2011, park officials said. villagers also want better protection. “the government is making conservation plans for tigers. but it should also produce plans to protect people from tigers,” krishna bhurtel, a village headman, told a nepali newspaper. wildlife authorities captured a tiger after it killed two people, including a villager who was pulled from his bed in may.thousands of tigers once roamed the forests in bangladesh, india and nepal. but their numbers have dropped to about 3,000, a 95% drop over a century. chitwan national park in central nepal has the highest number of adult tigers, with 120, followed by bardiya national park (50) and shukla phanta wildlife reserve (17).diwakar chapagain, head of a world wildlife fund nepal unit that monitors wildlife trade, said tiger skins were in demand in tibet, where rich people use them as festival costumes.in nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins for special occasions. some wealthy nepali have tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms. tiger bones are used in traditional chinese medicines. “the trade in tiger parts is lucrative and fetches thousands of dollars in illegal markets,” chapagain said.
intermediate	from all across rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring burundi, people are coming to the southern town of butare to a little shop called inzozi nziza (sweet dreams). they come for a taste of the unknown, something most have never tasted before ð sweet, cold ice cream.here, at the central african countryõs  rst ice- cream parlour, customers can buy scoops in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple  avours. toppings include fresh fruit, honey, chocolate chips and granola. black tea and coffee are also on sale.the shop, which has òice cream, coffee, dreamsó written on its signs, is taking advantage of local curiosity about the dessert ð and òchanging livesó in the process, says inzozi nzizaõs manager, louise ingabire.òice cream is important,ó she says between mouthfuls of a honey- avoured offering. òsome rwandans like ice cream, but itõs a new thing. we still have some work to do, to tell others that theyõll enjoy it.óthe shop can certainly make dreams come true. òi didnõt have a job before: i just stayed at home. now, i have a vision for the future. i am making money and i can give some of it to my family,ó says the 27-year-old.butare, which has 89,600 residents and is located 135km south of the capital, kigali, is the home of the national university of rwanda. inzozi nziza has become a meeting place for tired students looking to treat themselves to something cool and different.òitõs something uniting people here,ó kalisa migendo, a 24-year-old agriculture student, says. òif you need to go out and talk to a friend, a girl or a boy, you come to inzozi nziza for an ice cream.ómost of the ingredients are from local sources and the milk comes from nearby nyanza. the vanilla beans and cocoa are imported.inzozi nziza was opened by the theatre director odile gakire katese. she met alexis miesen and jennie dundas, co-founders of blue marble ice cream in brooklyn, new york, and formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010.òan ice-cream shop, katese said, might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits, hopes and family traditions,ó miesen says.at the start, miesen and dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative and non-pro t. after 18 months, they transferred their shares to the women, who had by then proved they could run the business.ice cream is new to rwanda. making the business successful requires a lot of skills and changing peopleõs way of thinking because selling and eating ice cream is not part of rwandan culture.the butare shop employs nine women, who spend their spare time practising with ingoma nshya, rwandaõs  rst and only female drumming group, which was established by katese ten years ago.the musicians are hutu and tutsi women. some are survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million tutsis and hutus were killed. some members of ingoma nshya are widows, some orphans.historically, says ingabire, rwandan women were forbidden to drum and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry. òbut itõs something which brings unity.óingabireõs father, two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide. òwhen iõm drumming, it gives me power because weõre still alive and survivors,ó she says.the ice-cream parlour is in a documentary by  lm-makers rob and lisa fruchtman. sweet dreams, which tells the story of how the women have made a promising post-genocide future, also includes the female drummers.the  lm has been shown in more than a dozen countries, including the us, uk and several african states. òwe feel the  lm is about resilience, hope, bravery, resourcefulness and the ability to change the course of your own life,ó says lisa fruchtman.nannan
intermediate	the controversial auction of a banksy mural that disappeared from the wall of a north london shop was dramatically stopped just moments before it was going to be sold.slave labour is a spray-painted artwork showing a child making british flags and is seen as a critical social commentary on last year’s diamond jubilee. it was expected to sell for about $700,000 in a sale of street and contemporary art in florida.but auctioneer frederic thut, the owner of the fine arts auction miami art house, who had refused all week to give the name of the seller, announced that slave labour, together with a second work by the secretive british street artist, had been removed from sale at the auction.he would not give a reason, but community leaders in haringey, london, who led a campaign to stop the sale of the artwork that was removed from the wall of a poundland shop in wood green, were extremely happy“one of our two demands was that it doesn’t sell and the other was that we get it back again, so we’re halfway there,” said alan strickland, a haringey councillor.“i will be writing to the auction house to clarify what happened and what will happen next, but for now we are really pleased that a community campaign in london has had an impact in the us. it’s a real victory for the people.”claire kober, leader of haringey council, wrote to arts council england and the mayor of miami, tomás regalado, to ask them to stop the sale, but it appears the decision to remove the item from sale came from the gallery owners.several hours after the auction, the auction house said it had persuaded the owners of the two banksys to remove them from the sale. “although there are no legal issues whatsoever regarding the sale of lots six and seven by banksy, faam convinced its sellers to remove these lots from the auction.”critics have accused the auction house of buying and selling stolen property but thut said that the seller, who he described as a “well known collector”, was the rightful owner and that the sale was legal.he added that his gallery had received many emails and phone calls from the uk, but said he supported selling the two pieces of artwork because it would preserve them.the second banksy to be auctioned, a 2007 artwork called wet dog that was removed from a bethlehem wall and is estimated to be worth up to $800,000, was removed from the auction house’s online catalogue, but slave labour was still listed for sale right up to the 3pm start time.thut said the two pieces, supplied to him by separate owners, neither of them british, were important works in the street art scene and deserved buyers “whose first interest is in art and its preservation”.a spokesperson for poundland said it had no idea who removed the 4ft x 5ft mural from the side of one of its shops in london.banksy himself has not commented on the slave labour controversy, but he has previously condemned people who have tried to sell his artwork. he spoke out before five of his pieces were going to be sold at a 2011 auction in new york. none found a buyer.stephan keszler, the dealer at that auction, believes selling banksy’s works without his permission is legitimate.“he does something on other people’s property without asking. the owner of the property can do whatever they want with it,” keszler said.nannan
intermediate	james hamblin, senior editor of the atlantic magazine, recently did an experiment. as part of his series, ôif our bodies could talkõ, hamblin took on a no-showering challenge to examine the effect of over-cleansing the body. he reduced the number of showers he had and did not use shampoo or soap when he had a shower.he discovered what thousands of others have: the more we try to clean ourselves with soaps and body washes, the harder our skin works to restore its balance and this encourages us to begin the whole process again. showering removes oil and bacteria from the skin. many would say òthat is the reason i shower!ó but, apparently, this sometimes works a little too well, especially when you add hot water and cleansing products.you know that feeling after a shower when you feel like your skin is tight? thatõs because much of your skinõs natural moisture has been washed down the drain. also, our skin, like our gut, has millions of bene cial bacteria. showering destroys these bacterial colonies; theyõre completely destroyed by all our frequent rubbing and scrubbing. and, when the bacteria washed off by soap return, they usually favour microbes which produce an odour ð yes, showering too often may actually make you smell more. however, when you stop showering and using soap, your skin goes through an initial (probably gross) adjustment period and, then, after that, the skin typically restores balance, oil production slows and healthy bacteria  ourish.by doing the challenge, hamblin realized what other no-soap/no-shower fans have known for years: that the human body, working on its own, is actually quite lovely. and, itõs not just scent and aesthetics ð although skin experts suggest that using less soap can improve skin conditions like eczema. reducing the frequency of showers (and the number of cleansing products used) has implications for our environment. the average shower lasts seven minutes and uses 65 litres of water. thatõs 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that weõre  lling with soap and washing down the drain each day ð sometimes more than once.the vital importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore, as california enters another summer of drought. itõs becoming clear that clean water is one of the most valuable things in the world and we soon wonõt have enough. add the environmental effect of all those body wash bottles and you have a number of very good reasons to let your body be a bit more natural.if the idea of showering less and using less soap is giving you the heebie-jeebies as you remember the last time you were close to people who already donõt shower enough, relax. many people who have decided to shower less still use deodorant if they  nd it necessary (everyoneõs natural scent varies in intensity and it can be affected by a number of things including diet, hydration and exercise). and, hand-washing with soap is still recommended as a vital way to reduce the spread of infectious diseases.you donõt need to give up completely, as hamblin did, but you donõt need to shower three times a day either. there is something in the middle. our familiar, simple advice is: reduce. skip a few showers, put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria  ourish a little.
intermediate	a car with a top speed of 25mph, two seats and no pedals or steering wheel might not make much of an impression at a motor show. but google, in the us, sent a shock through the car and taxi industries as it unveiled the latest version of its driverless car.the electrically powered vehicle, which google has begun testing around its headquarters in mountain view, california, dispenses with all the normal controls, including foot pedals. instead, it has a smartphone app that calls it and tells it the destination, and a single stop button between the two front-facing seats in case the passengers need to override the computer.the car, in fact, does all the tasks of navigation, steering, acceleration and braking.the company is building about 100 prototypes for a two-year test. the company’s co-founder, sergey brin, told a conference in california that the vehicle was “still in the prototype stage” but that the project was about changing the world for people who do not have good transportation today.he said of the car: “you’re just sitting there; no steering wheel, no pedals. for me, it was very relaxing. about ten seconds after getting in, i forgot i was there. i found it really enjoyable.”google says that the aim of the project is to improve safety and that, because the car is constructed with impact-absorbing foam at the front and a plastic windscreen, “it should be far safer than any other car for pedestrians”.the cars, which have been built specially by an unnamed company in detroit, will be used to find out how best to make driverless vehicles work. google will run a pilot programme using the cars, which are not yet for sale.one challenge is creating high-definition scans of the roads and surroundings before the cars can drive along them because they cannot collect and process enough information in real time.so far, there are high-detail maps of about 2,000 miles of california’s roads, but the state has more than 170,000 miles of public roads.google says it is interested in licensing the technology to traditional vehicle manufacturers once it has been refined.but the idea of driverless cars replacing humandriven taxis has been the cause of some alarm.dennis conyon of the uk national taxi association says that drivers will become unemployed.london has about 22,000 licensed black cabs and conyon estimates that the total number of people who drive taxis for hire in the uk is about 100,000.other car makers, including volvo, ford and mercedes, are working on driver-assisted vehicles, which, unlike google’s version, do not dispense with the driver controls.but chris urmson, director of the self-driving car project at google, said that the new prototypes dispensed with the steering wheel and brakes because a human passenger might not be able to take over in an emergency, and that it was simpler just to have an emergency stop button.urmson said: “the vehicles will be very basic. we want to learn from them and adapt them as quickly as possible. but they will take you where you want to go at the push of a button. and, that’s an important step towards improving road safety and improving mobility for millions of people.”so far, the google versions of the self-driving cars have driven 700,000 miles without an accident caused by the computer. the company says that thousands of people die each year on the roads and that about 80% of crashes are caused by human error.nannan
intermediate	dr ben brabon of edgehill university teaches a mooc – a massive open online course – in literature. the course is one of only two accredited moocs currently on offer in the uk. according to brabon, many students enrol on moocs because they are free and they enjoy communicating with other students. moocs have no enrolment criteria and no fees, so students behave very differently from students on traditional higher education courses.moocs are the newest big idea to try to make higher education available to everyone. a lot of money is being invested in new online platforms that deliver sophisticated and interactive courses to tens of thousands of students. investors hope to find a business model for moocs that will make them profitable – so far, courses have depended on universities funding their star lecturers’ course design and online teaching time. one way of making a return on the investment might be studying data about how, why and when millions of students sign up, interact with their material, submit their assignments, message each other and drop out of the course.one of the questions about the future direction of moocs is that nobody can yet say who exactly they benefit. universities who want to attract fee-paying international students onto postgraduate courses by showing off their best programmes online? students in developing countries who want access to first-world universities? employees who wish to develop their professional knowledge? people without qualifications who want to use moocs as a bridge to higher education? or hobby learners, who want to learn about a subject area in which they have an interest?moocs may be popular at the beginning, but they have very poor completion rates, says brabon. his literature course had 1,000 enrolments and 31 completions. “and almost all of those had a first degree or had been educated to degree level,” he says. “so moocs may not be opening up higher education to sectors of the population it hasn’t reached yet.”“learning online is a different thing and needs quite advanced learning skills,” confirms david kernohan, progamme manager for elearning innovation at a charity that promotes the use of digital technologies in uk education and research. “with moocs, there’s very little support available: the student does not get any individual attention. instead, they get peer support, such as online discussion forums.” although this may mean that online study is unattractive or difficult for someone without high-level qualifications, it suggests, he says, that moocs could be “a really good tool for continuing education.”at a time when the number of part-time students has fallen sharply because the price of a degree is rising, could this type of open and free-to-access course provide a new path to university-level education? could an entire degree be taught via moocs? “i don’t think that’s how moocs work,” says brabon. instead, he suggests “a blended approach that combines a campus experience with a mooc; also, perhaps, using moocs to create a global degree, with students taking courses from across the world, might be possible.”but that’s a little way into the future. for now, mooc completion certificates have no quality assurance on either the course content or its assessment standards, so employers will not be impressed by them. accreditation is now essential for moocs if they want to gain credibility with academics and employers, says brabon.some people are idealistic about moocs – they want to bring the best of first-world teaching to students in less developed countries. but there’s cynicism, too, with the suggestion that universities could use moocs to advertise their on-campus courses to bigger numbers of lucrative students from outside the eu.mike sharples, chair of educational technology, doesn’t agree with that cynicism. moocs are mainly a way to publicize and share universities’ best teaching talent, as well as encouraging interaction and getting feedback from students around the world, he says. he believes that enrolling international students onto university courses is only a secondary objective of moocs – but they could certainly be a very clever marketing idea, as he observes that “if 20,000 people sign up to a mooc – well, you only need 20 of those to enrol afterwards to run a master’s.”“in south america, china and countries in africa, there is a huge appetite for learning and some of the world’s best courses are now offered online,” adds sharples. “if people are genuinely fascinated by learning, then why not? the real challenge is to allow those countries not just to study moocs, but also to create them.”nan
intermediate	cities don’t often decide to pack their bags, get up and move down the road. but that’s exactly what kiruna, an arctic town in northern sweden, has to do – to avoid being swallowed up into the earth.“it’s a terrible choice,” says krister lindstedt of white, the swedish architects company that is managing the biblical task. they have to move this city of 23,000 people away from a gigantic iron-ore mine that is fast swallowing up the ground beneath its streets. “either the mine must stop digging, creating mass unemployment, or the city has to move.”founded in 1900 by the state-owned luossavaara-kiirunavaara mining company (lk), kiruna has grown rich off the vast amount of iron ore that is below the town but it’s now facing destruction by exactly the thing that made it rich. “the town is here because of the mine,” says deputy mayor niklas siren. “otherwise, no one would have built a city here.”located 145km inside the arctic circle, kiruna has a brutal climate. it has winters with no sunlight and average temperatures below -15c. but the iron ore has kept people here. it has become the world’s largest underground iron-ore mine. it produces 90% of all the iron in europe, enough to build more than six eiffel towers a day. and demand continues to grow.in 2004, the mining company told the town that its days were numbered: digging its shafts towards the city at an angle of 60 degrees, subsidence would soon lead to buildings cracking and collapsing. ten years later, cracks are starting to appear in the ground, and they are creeping closer and closer to the town.“the people of kiruna have been living in limbo for ten years,” says viktoria walldin, a social anthropologist who works with the architects. “they have put their lives on hold, unable to make major decisions like buying a house, redecorating, having a child or opening a business.”after years of dithering, the city finally has a plan for how it will proceed. lindstedt has a plan that shows the town’s streets and squares beginning to crawl eastwards along a new high street, until the whole place has moved safely away from the mine by 2033.a new town square is already being built, 3km to the east, with a circular town hall planned by danish architect henning larsen. twenty other key buildings will be dismantled and put together piece by piece in their new home – like an ikea flatpack on a bigger scale. kiruna’s red wooden church, built in 1912 and once voted sweden’s most beautiful building, will take pride of place in a new park, and the bell tower will stand once again above the town hall. but not everything will be saved.“i spoke to an old lady who walks past the bench every day where she had her first kiss,” says walldin. “it’s things like that – the hospital where your first child was born, for example – that are important to people and all that’s going to disappear.”called “the most democratic move in history”, the project will get £320m from the mining company for building new facilities, including a high school, fire station, community centre, library and swimming hall. but the biggest worry for most people is where they will actually live and how they will get a house or flat.“people are used to very low rents and very high incomes but, in future, this will have to change” says lindstedt. lk has agreed to compensate residents to the value of their homes plus 25% but many locals say this is not enough to afford a new-build house.a closer look at the plan shows the new town does not look like the original kiruna at all. the current town has winding streets and detached houses with gardens. white’s plan has multi-storey apartment blocks around shared courtyards in long straight streets.it is an opportunity, say the architects, for kiruna to “reinvent itself” into a town that will attract young people. there will be new cultural facilities and “visionary” things such as a cable car above the high street. but it is a vision that many of the existing residents will probably not be able to afford.nan
intermediate	will we soon live in a world where drones deliver packages? if you believe amazon, the answer is òyesó. others are not so sure: we need to make more technical progress in this area but there is also the problem of public safety.amazon spokesman paul misener told a us congress hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place. the federal aviation authority (faa) will  nally have regulations on the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by june 2016. but the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines arenõt legal yet ð only drones up to 25kg will be legal. and the faa says that, if youõre going to crowd the skies with radio- controlled  ying robots, they must all use different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack.professor sajiv singh, who runs a cargo delivery company called nearearth, said that, to pilot a state-of-the-art drone, you simply give it some basic instructions: go to this altitude, perform this short task, go back home. but even short  ights from a mobile landing pad could cause serious logistical problems, he said.òtheyõre not going to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; theyõre going to deliver from a warehouse to the consumer, which will probably be an urban area or a suburban area,ó he said. òin those particular cases, there are going to be hazards that the vehicle is going to have to see. maybe there will be terrain that the map doesnõt know about. then, maybe thereõs construction equipment that wasnõt there before but is there now. maybe gps signals are blocked, in which case itõs going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.ó all these problems can be solved, he said ð but itõs dif cult.one major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks. òif you have an off-the-shelf uav [unmanned aerial vehicle], itõll just keep going and crash into the ground,ó said roboticist daniel huber.furthermore, òyou canõt do everything with a 25kg aircraftó, said jay mcconville, director of business development for unmanned systems at lockheed martin. òpeople in the aircraft business have to remind ourselves that the operator doesnõt really care about every little thing about the aircraft and wants instead to focus on the end result,ó he said. òoperators want to see vehicle status information; they want to see video on their handheld device or their laptop.óòtechnologically, most of the things that we need for this are in place,ó said huber. he is working on a program to allow drones to inspect infrastructure ð pipelines, telephone lines, bridges and so on. òweõve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and it will  y around that area and look at every surface and then report back.óhuber, who works on 3d systems imagery, said about amazon: òi have heard them say that many packages are lightweight ð a drone can carry a kilogram for 15 minutes. if you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood, it can deliver from that base. you need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have that distance.ó itõs one way, he said, of making sure the surrounding population is relatively safe. òthe larger you get, the more dangerous you get.óproblems with the use of drones can be solved in some very dramatic ways, huber said. at a recent conference, he said, a disaster relief drone company demonstrated a robot that could take off and, when it got tired, land on its own charging station and exchange its batteries.of course, safety is still a major concern ð singh says that, for a commercial aircraft to be allowed to  y, it has to prove a rate of one serious failure every one million hours. drones, he said, are a long way from that. òthe reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours,ó singh said. but they donõt consider an oil leak a catastrophic failure ð something has to fall out of the sky.part of the reason for this is that air travel is dangerous so standards are much higher. òif you  y commercial airlines, they often say, ôoh, a component has failed ð we have to go back to the gate,õó singh said. òand thatõs an established industry with 60 years of legacy! i hate to think that a drone might come down on a busy road.ó part of the solution, singh said, is planning for every situation: òif things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.ónan
intermediate	when it comes to climate change, we usually just focus on the  rst part of the story, the part about the problem. we usually forget the second part of the story about the many available solutions. these solutions are speeding up recycling, slowing down emissions and providing sustainable alternatives to plastic, air conditioning, smartphones and fast fashion.the intergovernmental panel on climate change met recently in copenhagen to present its latest report on the impacts and speed of climate change. climate change is now measured on all continents. our efforts to lower emissions must be intensi ed to avoid climate change getting out of control. copenhagen looked at the risks and challenges but also the solutions.focusing on what can be done, sustainia award, chaired by arnold schwarzenegger, celebrated ten leading sustainable solutions used in 84 countries. from food to fashion, energy to transportation, education to health, the awards showed that there is an alternative to the grim-future scenarios we so often read about.from california, we saw how we can now produce plastics from greenhouse gases that are competitive with normal oil-based plastics in price and quality. from switzerland, we learned how we can recycle and reuse old clothes and shoes more effectively. and from canada, we learned how smartphones can make bike-sharing more convenient.the ten projects each offered unique solutions to sustainability challenges but it was the nigerian initiative, wecyclers, that won arnold schwarzenegger and the rest of juryõs vote. it won the sustainia award 2014.wecyclers allows poor communities to make money on waste in their streets. by using bicycles to collect and recycle waste in lagos, wecyclers lets families exchange garbage for consumer goods via an sms-based point system.recycling companies purchase wecyclersõ sorted waste and make it into products such as mattresses, pillows and trash bags. wecyclers is a response to local waste problems, where itõs estimated that only 40% of the cityõs rubbish is collected. according to the world bank, only 46% of municipal waste in africa is collected. more than 5,000 households are involved and there are plans to extend the initiative to other cities throughout nigeria.solutions to deal with climate change are often hi-tech innovations focused on cutting emissions. however, to successfully solve the variety of challenges, we need variety in our solutions as well. sustainability is not just about bringing down emissions, it is also a question of using our natural resources more intelligently and creating healthier lives for ourselves. these initiatives might be low-tech in innovation, but they are high-impact when it comes to creating sustainable change for entire communities.with a wide range of solutions for the wide range of challenges, we must focus more on the important part of the story that creates enthusiasm, momentum and that helps to create positive change.

elementary	how long can you hold your breath? iõm trying it right now. the  rst 30 seconds are easy. i want to give up at 45 seconds but i continue and it gets easier for a while. but, as i go past one minute, my heart is pounding. i breathe out a tiny bit and this helps. one minute and 12 seconds. iõm quite impressed with myself.in some sports, it is very important to be able to hold your breath, particularly in freediving. in 2006, i met sam amps, who was captain of the uk freedive team. at a swimming pool in bristol, she taught me some simple ways to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater. by the end of the session, i could hold my breath for 90 seconds, long enough to let me swim across the pool. sam swam across the pool three times easily. she could hold her breath for  ve minutes, while swimming. five minutes!i asked how she did it: very slow breathing for several minutes before each dive, then a big, deep breath before diving in.our heart rate doesnõt slow down when we hold our breath. at least, it doesnõt if youõre doing it on land. when youõre under cold water, the heart rate slows down in most people. this change in our bodies is useful in diving ð but it is even more useful for not drowning. holding our breath is becoming very useful in one particular area of medicine. radiotherapy for breast cancer involves pointing radiation exactly at the tumour. itõs usually done in short periods, between breaths. but, if the patient can hold their breath for several minutes, it means that doctors can give the complete radiation dose, in the right place, all at the same time. the problem, of course, is that most people cannot hold their breath for several minutes. but doctors at university hospital birmingham have shown that, if patients are given air with extra oxygen before holding their breath, they can hold it for  ve-and-a-half minutes.surprisingly, to achieve this you have to fool the diaphragm. when you breathe in, youõre pulling the muscle of your diaphragm  at so that the volume of your chest increases ð this pulls the air into your lungs. when you hold your breath, you keep your diaphragm like that. if you breathe extra oxygen before a breath-hold, as in the birmingham radiotherapy experiments, you may be able to stop the diaphragm from becoming tired too quickly. so, itõs your diaphragm, the main muscle of breathing, that is in charge when you are holding your breath. but, in the end, even if youõve fooled it for a while, the signals from the diaphragm become too strong and you have to give up ð and take a breath.nan
elementary	japanese entrepreneur takahito iguchi thinks google glasses are not cool. he may be right. there’s already a website with pictures of people wearing them – the people look ridiculous or smug or, more often, both. if you search google images for google glasses, one of the first pictures is of a large, naked man wearing them in the shower. iguchi hopes that this is google’s weak point. he has designed some glasses that are a bit more stylish and a bit more japanese.iguchi’s glasses aren’t really glasses – they are a piece of metal with a camera and a very small projector. the glasses are called telepathy one. since he first presented them to the public in texas, they have attracted $5 million from investors. like glass, you will be able to buy telepathy one in 2014.it’s a more simple version of google glass. glass has many uses – you can surf the internet, read emails, take photographs – but telepathy will be “more of a communication machine”. connected to your phone, it will allow real-time visual and audio sharing. you’ll be able to post photos and videos of what you see on facebook or send them as an email. or see and speak to a video image of a friend.“it will help bring you close to your friends and family. we are very focused on the communication and sharing possibilities,” says iguchi, who has worked in the japanese technology industry for 20 years. “i’m a visionary,” he says. “i have a dream that people will understand other people. when i go to london, i am a stranger. but i believe that everyone wants people to understand them and to understand other people. and, with the glasses, you can know more information about people before you even speak to them.”when iguchi was growing up, japanese technology ruled the world: they had the sony walkman, which was as popular as the iphone. now, to compete, he has had to leave tokyo and go to silicon valley. “tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture, but it’s still an island. it’s isolated. there is no way to expand. but, in silicon valley, everyone is from everywhere. it’s where you come to connect with the world.” they will make the glasses in japan and the software in the us.it was easy to build the prototype of telepathy one, iguchi says. “we have every sort of technology in tokyo. the problem is presenting it to the world.” the top manufacturers all want to work with him, he says, because they have the technology, they just find it difficult to sell it. “there needs to be a story to the product. apple had a story with the ipod – 1,000 songs in your pocket. and steve jobs was inspired by akio morita, the co-founder of sony, and he inspired me, so maybe it will come in a circle.”like steve jobs, iguchi is a confident man, but his strong japanese accent makes it difficult to understand him. it is possible that this fact helped him to find the idea for telepathy one. when he visited london, he stayed with someone he didn’t know. “he was not my friend, but i talked with him for three hours, and now he is my friend. that is how long it takes to understand each other, to share our feelings, and background, and career. maybe telepathy makes that quicker. if you are getting information from the cloud and social networks, that will happen more easily.”iguchi hopes that telepathy one will help people see other people’s point of view. as a student, he explains, he studied philosophy during the day and taught himself how to code at night. “and, one day, i opened the door of my apartment and i suddenly realized that everything is code. everything is coded and can be shared between humans. and everything can be encoded and decoded. and, if code can be exchanged between humans, that will end all war.”nannan

elementary	clay cockrell is sitting in his of ce opposite the trump international hotel and tower. in front of the tower is central park, where cockrell holds his popular walk and talk therapy sessions.cockrell is a former wall street worker who is now a therapist. he spends large parts of his days walking in central park or the battery park in downtown manhattan near wall street, talking to some of new yorkõs wealthiest people.òmany of the very wealthy ð the 1% of the 1% ð feel that their problems are really not problems. but they are,ó he says.so, what problems do americaõs 1% have? òthere is guilt that they are rich,ó he said. òthere is the feeling that they have to hide that they are rich. and, then, there is the isolation ð being in the 1% can be lonely.ócounsellors say that things have become worse since the  nancial crisis in 2008. people now talk about the gap between rich and poor more because of groups like occupy wall street.òoccupy wall street had some important things to say about the gap between rich and poor but it was negative about the 1%,ó said jamie traeger-muney, a wealth psychologist. the media, she said, makes the rich òfeel like they need to hide or feel ashamedó.òsometimes, i am shocked by things that people say. you would never talk about another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to talk about wealthy people.óòitõs really isolating to have a lot of money. peopleõs reaction to you can be scary,ó said barbara nusbaum, an expert in money psychology. òwe are all taught not to talk about money. itõs not polite to talk about money. but itõs harder to talk about being rich than it is to talk about being poor. people donõt mind if you say ôi am broke. things are hard.õ you canõt say ôi have a ton of money.õ you have to keep a lot of your life private.óas a result, cockrell says, the rich hang out with other rich americans who understand them and their problems.in the us, over the last 30 years, the number of very wealthy people has grown. in 2014, the number of us households with $1m or more ð excluding the value of their main home ð was 10.1 million. there were 1.3 million households worth $5 million and 142,000 worth $25 million or more.since the 2008  nancial crisis, the gap between the rich and the poor has grown and the situation òhas gotten worse for the wealthyó, cockrell said. the main reason? not knowing if your friends are friends with you or with your money.òsomeone else who is also a billionaire ð they donõt want anything from you. never being able to trust your friendships with other people, i think that is dif cult,ó said cockrell.òwealth can stop you from connecting with other people,ó said the wife of a man who made about $80 million. some americans keep their wealth secret.òthere are a lot of people hiding their wealth because they are worried about negative judgment,ó said traeger-muney. if wealthy americans talk about their problems, people donõt have a lot of sympathy,ó she said.cockrell said that there is a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make ð they let their money be the most important thing in their lives.òif you are part of the 1%, you still have problems. there are other parts of your life. money is not the only thing,ó he said. òyour problems are real.ónannannannan
elementary	margaret thatcher, the most famous british prime minister since winston churchill, has died at the age of 87. she was in poor health for many years, suffering from dementia. the british government says that her funeral will be at st paul’s cathedral.the british prime minister, david cameron, said: “i was very sad when l heard of lady thatcher’s death. we’ve lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great briton.” he added: “she was our first woman prime minister – and she didn’t just lead our country, she saved our country.” he added that he believed she would be remembered as the greatest british peacetime prime minister.president barack obama said, “here in america, many of us will never forget her close friendship with president reagan.”margaret thatcher was the first woman leader of an important western state. she was prime minister for 11 years until members of her own party removed her in 1990.when they heard of her death, politicians from all parties sent tributes.british labour party leader, ed miliband, said: “she will be remembered as a unique person. she changed the politics of a whole generation. she was britain’s first woman prime minister. she was a huge figure in the world. the labour party disagreed with a lot of what she did, but we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength.”the former conservative prime minister, sir john major, said that people who worked closely with her would always remember her courage and determination in politics and her humanity and generous spirit in private.the “iron lady” was a close ally of the us president ronald reagan in the final years of the soviet union. the union broke up because of reforms introduced by mikhail gorbachev. he was the russian leader who thatcher liked and worked closely with. as a result, many ordinary people in ex-communist countries still think of her as someone who supported their freedom.it was a surprise when thatcher became party leader in 1975. within ten years, she had become famous around the world – people both admired and hated her – for her reforms in the uk and her strong beliefs in foreign policy. she had a long battle with the ira, which almost killed her with a bomb in 1984.in the uk, thatcher’s main economic policy was the denationalization of state-owned industry – the new word “privatization” became used in many countries. she also defeated militant trade unions, particularly the national union of miners, after a long and terrible strike that lasted almost a year. with money from britain’s north sea oil fields, she was able to change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies – including some members of her own party.as the british economy became healthy again after the problems that her policies caused, it seemed for a short time that no-one would ever defeat her. but, as her friends and supporters retired or were replaced, she started to make mistakes and became more and more unpopular. finally, in 1990, after a vote among conservative mps failed to support her, john major took control of the party.after she retired, she wrote her memoirs and continued to promote her values around the world.nannannannannan
elementary	36-year-old junior smart knows a lot about gangs. when he was a teenager, after his mother died, he joined a south london gang. at the time, it helped fill a big gap in his life. “they became my new support group,” he says. “at first it was just a bit of fun but then it became more serious and we got involved in crime.” after he left college, he got a full-time job but he was also making money illegally as part of the gang.eventually he was arrested for serious drug crimes and was sent to prison for 12 years. “the first night after i was arrested was the biggest shock of my life,” he says. “i had been living a double life. i had been living as one person to my peers and another person to my peers’ enemies.”today, junior smart runs a team of 12 full-time workers and six volunteers, working to help young criminals and gang members to stop committing crimes. most of the team are ex-criminals like smart. a few are still in prison but are allowed out during the day to help. they work with the police, the probation service and other, voluntary organizations to help members of the violent criminal gangs of london.smart’s extraordinary journey from gang member to mentor began when he was in prison. “i couldn’t believe that people kept coming back in and nobody did anything about it. i was talking to the prisoners and they knew what was wrong in their lives, but the problem is that the prison system only deals with the crime.”“one guy spent £300 a week on cocaine and burgled houses to get the money. he told me how he walked into houses, even when he knew people were there. so he had a drug addiction, but that problem was never solved.”smart started working as a prison “listener” – a prisoner who helps new arrivals during their first days inside. then he had an idea to run his own scheme when he left prison – using the experience of ex-offenders to help others reject crime. he left prison after five years and started his scheme.so what does he think now? does he believe that things are getting better? he says the police have done some good work in arresting gang members. but he criticizes the government because they believe that, when the leader of a gang is arrested, the problem is solved. he believes the arrest of gang leaders can even make things worse.“when you arrest the leader, people in the gang start fighting. who was the most loyal? who had the most respect? it is a bit like a violent family. it means that the arrest of the gang leaders has no long-term effect.”can it make the streets more dangerous? “yes, it can. if one gang knows that an elder [leader] has been arrested, then they suddenly think that gang’s weak ... and so we have fights between different gangs. and what happens when that elder is in prison? he makes friends with other gang members, or when he comes out of prison he tries to take control back. that is when violence happens.”smart says gangs are now recruiting members in primary schools. the youngest members are called “tinies”. “over the last years we have seen more and more of this. the tinies can be just eight to eleven years old.” the youngest members protect their seniors from risk. they often sell drugs or even stab people, he says.smart says that the challenges are very big, particularly because the economy is so bad. “i try to help a young person who has been earning £300 a week illegally. it was difficult before but, with lots of unemployment, it’s even more difficult now.” but his project, which has more than 1,000 clients, is bringing results. fewer than 20% of the people he helps reoffend. smart believes that everyone should get a second chance.nannan
elementary	angela erdmann never knew her grandfather. he died in 1946, six years before she was born. but, on tuesday april 8th, 2014, she described the extraordinary moment when she received a message in a bottle, 101 years after he threw it into the baltic sea. the bottle is possibly the world’s oldest message in a bottle. it was presented to erdmann by the museum that is now exhibiting it in germany.“it was very surprising,” erdmann, 62, said, when she described how she found out about the bottle. “a man came to my door and told me he had post from my grandfather. then, he told me that someone had found a message in a bottle and that on the card was my grandfather’s name.” her visitor was a family-tree researcher who found her in berlin after someone gave the letter to a museum in the northern city of hamburg.the brown beer bottle was in the water for 101 years. a fisherman found it. holger von neuhoff, a curator at the museum, said this bottled message was the oldest he had ever seen. “there are documents without the bottle that are older and they are in the museum,” he said. “but, with the bottle and the document, this is certainly the oldest at the moment. it is in very good condition.”researchers believe that erdmann’s grandfather, richard platz, threw the bottle into the sea when he was on a hike in 1913. he was 20 years old at the time. a lot of the message on the postcard was impossible to read, but the address in berlin on the front of the card was legible. platz asked the person who found it to send the postcard to his home address.“he also included two stamps from that time that were also in the bottle, so the finder would not have to pay for postage,” erdmann said. “but he did not think it would take 101 years.”she said she was moved by the arrival of the message, but she did not known her grandfather because he died, at the age of 54, six years before she was born.“i knew very little about my grandfather. but i found out that he was a writer. he was very openminded, and he believed in freedom and that everyone should respect each other,” she said. “he did a lot for the young and later travelled with his wife and two daughters. it was wonderful because i could see where my roots came from.”erdmann said she also liked culture and travelling around the world, just like her grandfather. she described herself as open-minded, too. she was very happy to receive the bottled message, she said, but she hoped other people would not do what her grandfather did and throw bottles with messages into the sea. “today, the sea is so full of bottles and rubbish that we shouldn’t throw more in there,” she said.the message and the bottle will be on display at hamburg’s maritime museum until the beginning of may 2014. then, experts will try to decipher the rest of the text. it is not clear what will happen to the bottle after that, but erdmann hopes it will stay at the museum.“we want to find a few photos to put with the bottle and give it a face, so visitors can see the young man who threw the bottle into the water,” she said.nan
elementary	all six numbers match, so now you can buy that audi, book the holiday in the us and look for a new house. that’s what most lottery millionaires do, says a study of what jackpot winners do with their money.since it started in 1994, the uk national lottery has created 3,000 millionaires. the 3,000 winners have won an average of £2.8 million each. that’s more than £8.5 billion in total. together, they have created 3,780 more millionaires among their children, family and friends, according to the writers of the study, oxford economics.most winners (59%) give up work straight away, but 19% carry on working and 31% do unpaid voluntary work. the good news for the british economy is that 98% of the money that the winners spent stayed in the uk. through their spending on property, vehicles and holidays, it is estimated that each winner keeps six people in a full-time job for a year.winners have contributed almost £750 million to the economy. most of their money was spent on property, with £2.72 billion spent on winners’ main properties, and £170 million in paying off existing debt and mortgages.£2.125 billion was spent on investments. £1.17 billion was given to family and friends, and £680 million was spent on cars and holidays.it found that in total the 3,000 winners have bought 7,958 houses or flats in the uk, or 2.7 each, spending £3.3 billion. most winners (82%) bought a new house, spending an average £900,000.the new home is likely to have a hot tub, with almost a third (29%) putting that on their shopping list. 28% bought a walk-in wardrobe, almost a quarter (24%) bought a property behind electric gates, and 22% had a games room, with 7% installing a snooker table.30% of winners employed a cleaner and 24% a gardener for their new houses. a small proportion (5%) employed a beautician.audis were the favourite cars of 16% of winners, with range rovers and bmws also popular (11% each), as well as mercedes (10%) and land rovers (5%). winners spent £463 million on 17,190 cars.holidays were also important. most (68%) choose five-star hotels overseas. the us was the preferred destination for 27%, followed by the caribbean (9%). over the past 18 years, 10% of millionaires have bought a caravan.some winners (15%) have started their own businesses, 9% have helped others to start a business, and 6% have invested in or bought other people’s businesses. businesses started or supported by lottery winners employ 3,195 people, according to the study.nan
elementary	google has made maps of the world’s highest mountains, the ocean floor, the amazon rainforest and even shown us a bit of north korea. they want to make maps of the whole world, but they have mostly stayed away from the arctic.now, however, google is starting a very important update to hundreds of years of polar map making – and it hopes that the map will help give a better understanding of life on the permafrost for millions of web users. a small google team has flown to iqaluit, the largest town in the canadian territory of nunavut. they have taken their warmest winter clothes, many laptop computers and an 18kg telescopic camera that they can fix to their backpacks.the team spent four days collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on baffin island something that people across the world who live in cities now take for granted. an inuit mapping expert helped the google team and curious locals followed them around.the town of 7,000 people will go on display via google’s popular street view application in july 2013.when google made maps of other parts of the world it used a special camera on a car roof. in iqaluit that was not possible, so google’s map makers walked the town’s snowy roads and trails. some roads are made of ice and disappear in the short summer months.the team also walked along part of a 15km road known as the road to nowhere, despite warnings about meeting polar bears.the online map that google had already created using satellite images was mostly correct, but one road was missing that had been built in the last year.one difficulty was how to place on the map many businesses and homes that have mail sent to the local post office and not delivered to their address. putting the po box addresses on the map would mean the new map would show all the companies, banks and schools in the same place, around the canada post building in the centre of town.about 30 inuit elders, business people and high-school pupils helped google to correct this problem. they were given a laptop computer and told how to make sure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up correctly on the map.the project is more than a novelty. arif sayani, the town’s director of planning, said that people who are thinking of visiting or moving to the area would be able to use the maps to see the area. it may also help planning decisions in iqaluit happen more quickly.the project leader for google said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns. but moving people and equipment around the vast arctic territory is very expensive. so, in the future, google might send equipment to the area and ask volunteers to complete the map.nannannannannannannan
elementary	like a typical bad boyfriend, dan sullivan arrived late to breakfast with the guardian because the police stopped him on his motorcyclesullivan works too much, he says. he misses dinner dates. he forgets to give presents.and so, like many others in silicon valley, the 27-year-old has started a business: betterboyfriend.me, a service that sends girlfriends and wives a present every month for about $70.sullivan is testing the service and has about 350 boyfriends as his clients. most clients, he says, are his friends from university and other friends who are founders of start-ups or work for companies like apple, google and facebook. the girlfriends of these men get presents from sullivan.each month, sullivan’s clients choose from a list of seven possible gifts (chocolate, tea sets, etc). then, sullivan sends the gift to the boyfriend.for sullivan, the surprise was the real relationships that he has formed with his clients. sullivan says he has begun to see himself as a sort of relationship consultant for the boyfriends.sullivan says he’s made mistakes. in the beginning, the gifts he sent included receipts with his name on, dan sullivan. “one of the boyfriends wrote to me and said, ‘she’s not mad but cynthia found out’.”of all the women betterboyfriend.me deliver packages to, about 50% know that sullivan chooses the presents they receive: “it’s connected with age. i think, after you’ve been married for a longer time, you don’t keep many secrets.”and over the year, the young founder says he’s got to know the boyfriends really well. they’ve even sent a package to a hospital delivery room. the key, he said, is to remember that his relationship is with the boyfriend.when he first started his company, he attached tags that said betterboyfriend.me to flower bouquets and went to the mission district in san francisco.“i looked for couples and gave the flowers to the girl but the boyfriends didn’t like that. not at all,” he said. “so i changed my idea and gave the flowers to the boyfriends.”nannannannan
advanced	he had the tastes of a typical millionaire. he owned a gold and silver rolex and a fleet of expensive cars. he liked to dabble in modern art. but, although this chinese businessman had several companies and a palatial villa in the madrid suburbs, he had almost no money in the bank, a detail that piqued the interest of spanish authorities.gao ping, who had lived most of his adult life in spain, had a monopoly on supplies to 4,000 chinese bazaars across the mediterranean country. but, authorities suspected he was not paying taxes on the clothes, furniture and other goods he was importing from china.when police swooped on his warehouses in 2012 they found piles of cash: wads of €100, €200 and €500 notes were wrapped in elastic bands. around €12m was wheeled away in trolleys, the largest ever cash seizure by spanish police. the gang, with gao the alleged ringleader, stands accused of laundering up to €300m a year, as well as selling counterfeit goods and toys with fake safety marks. the government prosecutor said gao’s illegal business was so big it was damaging the competitiveness of spain. gao is on bail; the case has not yet come to trial.law enforcement officials have long had concerns about €500 notes. small and easy to transport relative to their value, they are the payment method of choice for tax dodgers, money launderers and drug barons. the sum of €1m in €500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag, where the same amount in €50 notes would require a small suitcase. cash mules have been known to fold the notes into plastic pellets and swallow them. a less dangerous method of concealment is to stuff the banknotes into a car chassis.the uk stopped distribution of the €500 note in 2010 on the grounds that demand for it was “almost entirely for criminal purposes”. in 2009, italy’s central bank warned that the notes were widely used by mafia money launderers and terrorists. other countries have limited their own highdenomination notes due to links to organized crime – canada scrapped its $1,000 note in 2000 on the advice of law enforcement officers.in an age of electronic payment systems and contactless cards, more are questioning whether printing these notes can be justified. peter sands, the former head of standard chartered bank, has called for the abolition of high-denomination notes, including the €500, the $100, the 1,000 swiss franc note and the £50. in a report for the harvard kennedy school of government, sands argued it was time to get rid of high-value notes that make life easier for “bad guys” pursuing tax evasion, financial crime, terrorist finance and corruption. although criminals would switch to smallerdenomination bills, or gold or diamonds, these substitutes are bulkier and more traceable, making it more likely they will get caught, he said.at a conference on terrorist financing in london, the head of europol, rob wainwright, called on the european central bank (ecb) to look at whether it “should continue to produce and circulate these notes that make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide their business and to fund illegal activities”. according to europol, the purple €500 note accounts for 30% of the value of all the euro notes in circulation, although most people have never seen one.the €500 note was introduced in 2002 when the euro was born: it replaced the 1,000 deutschmark, the 10,000 belgian franc and the 500,000 italian lira. several european countries favoured highvalue banknotes. “it is definitely a preference that has been there for a long time,” says pia hüttl, an affiliate fellow at the bruegel thinktank. “the preference is based on the idea that cash has a lower cost and is accepted everywhere.”cash remains king in germany and austria, where more than half of all transactions are made with paper money and coins. the former president of germany’s constitutional court, hans-jürgen papier, told germany’s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that restrictions on cash were at odds with individual freedom, while tabloid newspaper bild has launched a petition in defence of paper money, including the €500 note – “hands off my cash”.law enforcement authorities are less convinced, amid a steady stream of reports of suspicious bundles of cash. in one case that has caught the attention of police, two men walked into a bank and tried to deposit €200,000 of torn and muddy €500 notes. in the same week, €1.3m in €500 notes was found stuffed in the false bottom of suitcase. but, a suspicion of criminality is not enough to keep people in custody. “our frustration from a law enforcement perspective is that, in many jurisdictions, it is impossible to provide sufficient evidence to satisfy judicial authorities of a link between suspicious cash detections and criminality,” says jennifer macleod, a specialist in europol’s financial intelligence group. “the search for these links is complicated further through time constraints and fragmented cooperation and information exchange.”the agency would like to see central banks take more responsibility for the “striking anomalies” in the use of €500 notes. luxembourg, for example, issued more than twice its annual gdp in banknotes in 2013 alone, despite being one of the most cash-averse countries in europe. europol asked luxembourg’s central bank to explain. “the reply we had from luxembourg is that they simply issue the notes requested and have no explanation for the reasons behind the demand,” macleod says. “i find it surprising that a central bank does not consider itself to have a responsibility in this area.”this could be changing. mario draghi, the head of the ecb, has said he is determined that the income the bank generates from issuing the notes should not be “a comfort for criminals”. other members of the ecb’s top team, such as yves mersch, contend there is no evidence about the criminal uses of the €500 note. but, amid heightened fears about terrorism, this argument may no longer cut any ice. eu finance ministers have called on policymakers to explore “appropriate restrictions” on high-value notes and report back by 1 may 2016.
advanced	prince harry has flown out of afghanistan at the end of a four-month tour, during which he admitted killing insurgents while piloting his apache helicopter and spoke in rare depth about the tensions and frustrations of being a royal who craved life out of the spotlight.he also revealed his disdain for and distrust of some sections of the media and described how his father constantly reminded him to behave more like a member of the royal family.a commander of the army’s most sophisticated attack helicopter, the prince said he had fired on the taliban during operations to support ground troops and rescue injured afghan and nato personnel. his remarks may be seized upon by insurgents to stir anti-british sentiment, but the prince said he was only doing his job. most of the time the helicopter acted more as a deterrent, he said.in a series of interviews during his time based at camp bastion in helmand province, he hinted at the difficulty of reconciling the different roles in his life. the prince, known as captain wales in the army, explained his ‘three mes’. “one in the army, one socially in my own private time and then one with the family and stuff like that. so there is a switch and i flick it when necessary.”he admitted he sometimes ‘let himself down’ with his laddish behaviour, which he put down to “probably being too much army and not enough prince”, but he said he was entitled to privacy, too.in another unusually frank exchange, he aimed biting criticism at the media, especially the sun, the daily mail and the daily telegraph, three of the royal family’s most ardent supporters in fleet street. he said he was particularly annoyed by articles comparing his role as an apache co-pilot gunner to spitfire crews waiting to scramble during the second world war. “no, it’s not like that at all,” he said.the prince said his suspicion of the media was rooted in the treatment of his family when “i was very small”, but that he couldn’t help monitoring the stories written about him. “of course i read them,” the prince said. “if there’s a story and something’s been written about me, i want to know what’s being said. but all it does is just upset me and anger me that people can get away with writing the stuff they do; not just about me, but about everything and everybody. my father always says, ‘don’t read it’. everyone says, ‘don’t read it, because it’s always rubbish’.”the prince was posted to afghanistan last september to command a £45m apache helicopter – one of the military’s most sophisticated and well-armed aircraft. during his tour, the apaches flew missions supporting nato troops fighting the taliban and accompanied british chinook and us black hawk medical helicopters during casualty evacuations.four years ago, the prince had to be spirited out of afghanistan during his first tour after a media embargo was broken by mistake by an australian magazine. this time, the ministry of defence chose to publicize his deployment on the understanding that newspapers and broadcasters would not give a running commentary on his life out there to allow him to get on with his job. two-man crews from the bbc, sky and itn were sent once each to report on his visit, while a photographer and a reporter from the press association were embedded on all three visits.asked whether he felt more comfortable being captain wales than prince harry, his reply was one of the most revealing he has given about his relationship with prince charles. “definitely. i’ve always been like that. my father’s always trying to remind me about who i am and stuff like that. but it’s very easy to forget about who i am when i am in the army. everyone’s wearing the same uniform and doing the same kind of thing. i get on well with the lads and i enjoy my job. it really is as simple as that.”shortly before he went to afghanistan, the prince was caught in another media furore, when pictures emerged of him frolicking naked in las vegas during a private party. harry said he had let himself down, but also blamed the media. “i probably let myself down, i let my family down, i let other people down. but, at the end of the day, i was in a private area and there should be a certain amount of privacy that one should expect. it was probably a classic example of me probably being too much army, and not enough prince. it’s a simple case of that.“the papers knew that i was going out to afghanistan anyway, so the way i was treated from them i don’t think is acceptable.” he added, “certain people remind me, ‘remember who you are, so don’t always drop your guard’.”asked where he and his brother’s fascination with helicopters came from, he said, “probably the fact that you can only fit a certain amount of people in a helicopter, therefore no one can follow us, like you guys.”

advanced	when larry pizzi, a veteran bicycle industry executive, first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago, he asked: “why would anyone want to screw up a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it?”it’s a question that still puzzles traditionalists. bicycle shops have been slow to stock e-bikes, even though they have been around since the late 1990s. sales in the us have been modest.pizzi, who is now ceo of currie technologies, the number one seller of e-bikes in the us, believes that’s about to change. others in the industry agree. familiar brands including trek, raleigh and specialized all offer electric models and they’re betting the market is about to take off.“we’re on the cusp of mainstream adoption,” pizzi said. “there are more players entering the category, it seems, with every passing month.”the us is an outlier when it comes to electric bikes. nearly 32m e-bikes were sold in 2014, the vast majority in china, where they are primarily used for transportation. they are popular in much of europe, too. they’re common in the netherlands and switzerland; german postal workers use them to get around and bmw offers one for about $3,000.electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds, which rely on motorized power; they are bicycles that can be pedalled with – or without – assistance from an electric motor. riding an e-bike feels like riding a conventional bike with a brisk tailwind; the motor helps you go faster or climb hills but it’s typically not the primary source of propulsion. unlike mopeds, e-bicycles are usually permitted on bike paths and they can’t travel faster than 20mph.there’s debate about how many electric bikes are sold in the us and there is no official count. estimates of annual sales range from about 50,000 to 175,000. that’s comparable to the number of electric cars sold in the us – 118,000 in 2014. yet, while many people are aware of the nissan leaf, chevy volt and tesla, few have heard of e-bike companies currie, pedego or electrobike.to succeed, the electric bike business in the us must clear legal, cultural and financial hurdles. e-bikes are banned in some states, including new york, although the law isn’t strictly enforced. traditionalists who own and staff bike shops don’t like putting motors on bicycles, citing, among other things, the added weight. some e-bikes are close to 30kg.e-bikes are also pricey. while low-end models sell for as little as $700, court rye, the founder and editor of electricbikereview.com, a popular website, says riders should expect to pay at least $1,500 for a quality e-bike with a good battery. top-of-the-line models cost more than twice that.the companies that make and sell e-bikes say they can overcome those obstacles. e-bike technology, particularly the batteries, is improving. “batteries are getting smaller, they’re getting lighter, they’re getting more reliable and they are lasting longer,” says don dicostanza, the founder and ceo of pedego, an electric bikemaker and retailer.companies like bosch, the german electronics giant, and shimano, the leading manufacturer of bicycle gears, are entering the business, which should help erode resistance from bike shops. “this has really caught the attention and the imagination of bicycle dealers,” says currie’s larry pizzi. pedego and startup electrobike aren’t waiting for the shops to come around; they are building their own stores. in the meantime, lobbying efforts are underway to permit the use of e-bikes everywhere.perhaps most importantly, as more cities build cycling infrastructure, including dedicated bike lanes, bicycle commuting has become more popular. as the us census bureau reported in 2014, the number of bike commuters grew from about 488,000 in 2000 to 786,000 in 2012. that’s a “larger percentage increase than that of any other commuting mode,” the report notes. electric bikes make commuting more practical – and fun – by easing worry about hills, headwinds, fatigue and sweat.most of our customers are “ageing baby boomers who want to rekindle the experience they had as a kid,” says pedego’s don dicostanza. “the main reason they stopped riding bikes was because of hills.” pedego has opened nearly 60 stores in the us and it has sold bikes to tour companies in san francisco and washington, dc.electrobike, which operates 30 stores in mexico, opened its first american store in venice beach, california in the autumn of 2014 and hopes to grow to 25 us stores in a year. ceo craig anderson says: “we want to help reduce traffic, help reduce our carbon footprint and promote a healthy lifestyle.” he tells customers: “ride this once and try not to smile.”startups like pedego and electrobike will have to compete with big companies like trek and currie, which, in 2012, was acquired by the accell group, a public company based in the netherlands that is europe’s market leader in e-bikes. accell owns the raleigh brand, as well as haibike, an award-winning german electric bike.“accell has great expectations about e-bikes in north america,” currie’s larry pizzi says. “while baby boomers are still a very important segment, we’re finding that a lot of younger people are using e-bikes for transportation, instead of cars.”accell’s yuba brand even sells a cargo bike with a stronger motor and rear rack. “you can carry two children,” says pizzi. “you can carry 45kg of shopping. it’s a minivan alternative.”
advanced	opposition to western australiaõs shark cull has intensi ed as thousands of people took to beaches across the continent to call on the stateõs premier to end the policy, and rspca australia and virgin atlantic owner richard branson spoke out against it. the controversial catching and killing of sharks longer than three metres began after what the state government called an òunprecedentedó number of shark attacks on western australiaõs coast, which saw a 35-year-old surfer killed in november 2013. he was the sixth person to die from a shark attack in two years.however, according to the shark attack file, australia as a whole has averaged one shark- related fatality a year for the last 50 years. kate faehrmann, a board member at the sea shepherd conservation society, said from a protest in perth: òweõve been saying all along that this policy wonõt work. drumlines, used to catch the sharks, are indiscriminate killers. theyõll kill sharks whether theyõre one, two, three metres or more, as well as dolphins, turtles and other things. thatõs why the community doesnõt want it.óthousands of people protested on perthõs cottesloe beach and sydneyõs manly beach, as well as hundreds at glenelg, in south- west adelaide, and at beaches in victoria and queensland. faehrmann said the protests had shown australians wanted sharks protected: òwhatõs amazing is so many people in australia love sharks. this has demonstrated something about the national psyche, that, despite jaws, despite all the fear, people are coming out in their thousands across the country to say, ôthatõs their ocean. we respect them, we love them and we donõt want them killed.õó anthony joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharkõs mouth, said: òthe number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference in the scheme of things.óthe state government has refused to provide a running tally of sharks killed, though there have been reports of sharks smaller than three metres being released after getting caught on drumlines,  oating drums anchored to the sea bed with bait hanging on hooks beneath them. conservationists argue there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, as no previous cull has solely used drumlines. researchers at the university of western australia say the recent spate of shark attacks in the state may have more to do with the state having the fastest-growing population in australia, rather than a rising number of sharks.richard peirce, chairman of the uk-based conservation charity, the shark trust, said that the cull would be ineffective and potentially lure more predators towards the coast. òthe activity in western australia is compounding the human tragedy of shark attacks. it is very sad that a government that could be seen to take positive initiatives with regards to sharkð human interactions by trialling alternatives to indiscriminate killing has ignored the best advice and opted for an approach that is ineffective and counterproductive,ó he said. òthe indiscriminate nature of drumlines is often overlooked ð even if monitored through the day, leaving the lines in overnight has the potential to attract other predators into the area, attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured.óglobally, in 2012, there were 80 unprovoked attacks by sharks, seven of which proved fatal, compared to nearly 100m sharks killed by humans each year. rspca australia released a statement saying it believes the cull is unjusti ed. òthere is no evidence that the increase in attacks is a result of increasing shark numbers. rather, it is consistent with a changing population and human behaviour; that is, there are greater numbers of people in the water,ó it said.richard branson told fairfax radio the policy was back ring. òiõm sure one of the reasons western australia premier, colin barnett, did it was because he was thinking it would encourage tourism. itõs going to do quite the reverse, i think. youõre advertising a problem that doesnõt exist in a major way and youõre deterring people from wanting to come to perth and your beautiful countryside around it. all youõre going to achieve, i think, is to worry people unnecessarily.ó
advanced	david cameron, barack obama and pamela anderson have refused. george w bush, benedict cumberbatch and stephen hawking have taken part. as the ice bucket challenge notched up $100m for a us motor-neuronedisease charity and £4.5m for a british one, as well as thousands more for charities in hong kong and australia, the bracing cold water of a backlash has quickly followed.narcissistic celebrities showing off toned bodies, people having all the fun without donating, complaints about the waste of water – the attacks have come from commentators, animal-rights groups and environmentalists. and the us amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) association – which is not related to britain’s mnd association – also came under fire for the six-figure salaries being paid to its top staff.meanwhile, the challenge continues to grow. for anyone unaware of how it works, someone gives a short speech to camera about the charity, then dumps a bucket of ice cubes in water over their head, or gets a friend to do it, before nominating three people to either do the same or donate.it began in the us in july, although whether it was on a golf course or a baseball field depends on which version you prefer, and first appeared on mainstream american television on 15 july. but the als association has now been forced to withdraw an attempt to patent the phrase “ice bucket challenge” after criticism. “we understand the public’s concern and are withdrawing the trademark applications,” spokeswoman carrie munk said. the als has yet to respond to criticism of its high overheads and wage bills.the unfortunate coincidence that 31 august to 5 september was world water week, with international delegates arriving in stockholm to discuss the planet’s water crisis, has not been lost on some. the charity wateraid is asking people to use recycled water from bathtubs or garden butts or to douse people with sea water.douglas graham, the mnd association’s fundraising director, said: “the backlash is to be expected but, really, this is just a wonderful windfall and we’re so grateful. we didn’t see it coming but, suddenly, the donations just started.” the boost is an enormous help to a small charity looking after sufferers of a debilitating, littleunderstood disease that has no cure and kills five people a day in the uk.former baywatch star pamela anderson, a longstanding animal-rights activist, wrote an open letter to the als association, saying she could not support its record on animal experimentation. a few us stars have rejected the challenge because of california’s drought. actor matt damon got around the problem by pulling up water from his toilets – pointing out that much of the world had less clean drinking water available. actor verne troyer used milk, again citing environmental reasons. and the challenge has been blamed for causing a water shortage on the scottish island of colonsay after its 135 inhabitants picked up on the craze.in australia, a tv anchorman apologized over his robust “no, thanks” response to being nominated. lincoln humphries had said: “instead of pouring fresh water over your own head and wasting ice, here is a list of charities helping communities in desperate need of money across the world. i’d like to nominate everyone, everywhere, who has more than they need, to donate what they can to the people who need it most … because that is what charity is about, not putting yourself through mild discomfort with a bucket of icy water.”another criticism has been that small charities won’t be able to cope with the extra cash, but the mnd association rejected this. “oh, we can cope here,” said graham. “we fund world-class research into the causes and, ultimately, to find a treatment or cure. we provide care and support for 3,500 people and they need it because this is such a rapidly progressing disease and it’s a costly one to manage. over 50% die within two years of diagnosis. it’s heartbreaking to see the decline in people we work with over just a few months.”but, for many people with a connection to the disease, the awareness that the challenge has created is as valuable as the cash. graham says it is priceless. normally, the mnd association gets around 300,000 hits a year on its website. on a single day recently, it had 330,000.“we couldn’t have created this if we’d tried. charities are all worthwhile causes and i understand even that some people might want to donate to a different one. in 2013, british people gave £62bn to charity – we should be proud of that. it’s fabulous for us to get this windfall. we’ll be sitting down over the next few weeks to work out how to spend it in the best way but, i assure you, every penny will count for good.”
advanced	amsterdam still looks liberal to tourists, who were recently assured by the labour mayor that the city’s marijuana-selling coffee shops would stay open despite a new national law tackling drug tourism. but the dutch capital may lose its reputation for tolerance over plans to dispatch nuisance neighbours to “scum villages” made from shipping containers.the mayor, eberhard van der laan, insists his controversial new £810,000 policy to tackle antisocial behaviour is to protect victims of abuse and homophobia from harassment. the camps where antisocial tenants will be rehoused for three to six months have been called “scum villages” because the policy echoes proposals from geert wilders, the far-right populist, who last year demanded that “repeat offenders” be “sent to a village for scum”.but bartho boer, a spokesman for the mayor, denies that the plans are illiberal. “we want to defend the liberal values of amsterdam,” he says. “we want everyone to be who he and she is – whether they are gay and lesbian or stand up to violence and are then victims of harassment. we as a society want to defend them.” according to boer, the villages are not for “the regular nuisance between two neighbours where one has the stereo too loud on saturday night” but “people who are extremely violent and intimidating, and in a clear situation where a victim is being repeatedly harassed”.those deemed guilty of causing “extreme havoc” will be evicted and placed in temporary homes of a “basic” nature, including converted shipping containers in industrial areas of the city. “we call it a living container,” says boer. housing antisocial tenants in these units, which have showers and kitchens and have been used as student accommodation, will ensure that they are not “rewarded” by being relocated to better accommodation.dutch newspaper the parool has pointed out that in the 19th century troublemakers were moved to villages in drenthe and overijssel, which rapidly became slums. but boer insists that the administration has learned from past mistakes and is not planning to house the antisocial together.it would be more accurate to call them “scum houses” than scum villages, says boer, “because we don’t want to put more than one of these families in the same area”. after up to six months in these houses, scattered around the city, the tenants will be found permanent homes. the city government anticipates moving around ten families a year into this programme, which starts in 2013.the temporary dwellings will be heavily policed, but antisocial tenants will also have access to doctors, social workers and parole officers. “they are taken care of so the whole situation is not going to repeat at the new house they are in,” says boer.
advanced	crunchy, full of protein and to be found under a rock near you. insects have long been overlooked as food in all but a handful of places around the world – but now they are crawling closer and closer to our plates. spring 2013 will see a drive towards removing the yuck factor and putting insects not just on experimental gastronomic menus but also on supermarket shelves.in april, there will be a festival in london, pestival 2013 – a wellcome trust-backed insect appreciation event where the consumption of creepy-crawlies comes high on the agenda. it will feature a two-day “pop-up” restaurant by the nordic food lab, the scandinavian team behind the danish restaurant noma, which brought ants to the table for a sellout ten-day run at claridge’s hotel in mayfair in 2012.noma has been named the world’s best restaurant by restaurant magazine for three years running. its chef, rené redzepi, says that ants taste like lemon, and a purée of fermented grasshoppers and moth larvae tastes like a strong fish sauce. bee larvae make a sweet mayonnaise used in place of eggs and scientists are constantly coming up with new ways to use little creatures.in march, a bbc documentary will feature food writer stefan gates searching out and eating deep-fried locusts and barbecued tarantulas. but, behind all the gimmicks and jokes about flies in the soup there is a deeply serious message. many experts believe there is a clear environmental benefit to humans eating creepy-crawlies.the un’s food and agriculture organization (fao) has been funding projects since 2011 aimed at promoting the eating and farming of insects in south-east asia and africa, where an estimated two billion people already eat insects and caterpillar larvae as a regular part of their diet. in 2012, the fao published a list of 1,909 edible species of insect and, with sponsorship from the dutch government, plans a major international conference on “this valuable food source” in 2013.insects are plentiful – globally, for every human there are 40 tonnes of insects – so there is not too much chance of them being endangered, and they are unlikely to have been dosed with chemicals. “i know it’s taboo to eat bugs in the western world, but why not?”, redzepi has said. “you go to south-east asia and this is a common thing. you read about it from all over the world, that people are eating bugs. if you like mushrooms, you’ve eaten so many worms you cannot imagine. but also we eat honey, and honey is the vomit of a bee. think of that next time you pour it into your tea.”he said that the basic premise behind nordic food lab was: “nothing is not edible.”insects are critical to life on earth and, with more than a million species, are the most diverse group of creatures on the planet, yet they are misunderstood, hated and often put to death by humans just because they are there.over the next 30 years, the planet’s human population will increase to nine billion. already one billion people do not get enough food. the increase will mean more pressure on agricultural land, water, forests, fisheries and biodiversity resources, as well as nutrients and energy supplies.the cost of meat is rising, not just in terms of hard cash but also in terms of the amount of rainforest that is destroyed for grazing or to grow feedstuff for cattle. there is also the issue of methane excreted by cows. the livestock farming contribution, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, is enormous – 35% of the planet’s methane, 65% of its nitrous oxide and 9% of the carbon dioxide.edible insects emit fewer gases, contain high-quality protein, vitamins and amino acids, and have a high food-conversion rate, needing a quarter of the food intake of sheep, and half of pigs and chickens, to produce the same amount of protein. they emit fewer greenhouse gases and less ammonia than cows and can be grown on organic waste. china is already successfully setting up huge maggot farms. zimbabwe has a thriving mapone caterpillar industry and laos was given nearly $500,000 by the fao to develop an insect-harvesting project. it’s already big business in the uk, though not always official: a man was recently detained by gatwick customs as he stepped off a flight from burkina faso with 94 kilos of mapone, worth nearly £40,000, in his luggage.a study by foodservicewarehouse.com suggested that swapping pork and beef for crickets and locusts could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 95%. but perhaps the fairest thing about eating worms and insects comes when we are dead – then they get a chance to nibble their own back.
advanced	at addis ababa airport, visitors are greeted by pictures of golden grains, minute ochre-red seeds and a group of men gathered around a giant pancake. billboards boast: “teff: the ultimate gluten-free crop!”ethiopia is one of the world’s poorest countries, well known for its precarious food security situation. but it is also the native home of teff, a highly nutritious ancient grain increasingly finding its way into health-food shops and supermarkets in europe and america.teff’s tiny seeds – the size of poppy seeds – are high in calcium, iron and protein, and boast an impressive set of amino acids. naturally gluten free, the grain can substitute for wheat flour in anything from bread and pasta to waffles and pizza bases. like quinoa, the andean grain, teff’s superb nutritional profile offers the promise of new and lucrative markets in the west.in ethiopia, teff is a national obsession. grown by an estimated 6.3 million farmers, fields of the crop cover more than 20% of all land under cultivation. ground into flour and used to make injera, the spongy fermented flatbread that is basic to ethiopian cuisine, the grain is central to many religious and cultural ceremonies. across the country, and in neighbouring eritrea, diners gather around large pieces of injera, which doubles as cutlery, scooping up stews and feeding one another as a sign of loyalty or friendship – a tradition known as gursha.outside diaspora communities in the west, teff has flown under the radar for decades. but a growing appetite for traditional crops and booming health-food and gluten-free markets are breathing new life into the grain, increasingly touted as ethiopia’s “second gift to the world”, after coffee.sophie kebede, a london-based entrepreneur who owns a uk company specializing in the grain, says she was “flabbergasted” when she discovered its nutritional value. “i didn’t know it was so sought after. i am of ethiopian origin; i’ve been eating injera all my life.”growing demand for so-called ancient grains has not always been a straightforward win for poor communities. in bolivia and peru, reports of rising incomes owing to the now-global quinoa trade have come alongside those of malnutrition and conflicts over land, as farmers sell their entire crop to meet western demand.ethiopia’s growing middle class is also pushing up demand for teff and rising domestic prices have put the grain out of reach of the poorest. today, most small farmers sell the bulk of what they grow to consumers in the city.this may have helped boost incomes in some rural areas but it has had nutritional consequences, says the government, as teff is the most nutritionally valuable grain in the country. estimates suggest that, while those in urban areas eat up to 61kg of teff a year, in rural areas, the figure is 20kg. the type consumed differs, too: the wealthy almost exclusively eat the more expensive magna and white teff varieties; less well-off consumers tend to eat less-valuable red and mixed teff, and more than half combine it with cheaper cereals such as sorghum and maize.the ethiopian government wants to double teff production by 2015. its strategy, published in 2013, argues that the grain could play an important role in school meals and emergency aid programmes, and help reduce malnutrition – particularly among children and adolescents.though ethiopia has a fast-growing economy, it remains on the un’s list of least-developed countries. an estimated 20% of under-fives are malnourished or suffer stunted growth.the government’s agricultural transformation agency aims to boost yields by developing improved varieties of the grain, along with new planting techniques and tools to reduce post-harvest losses.government restrictions, instituted in 2006, forbid the export of raw teff grain, only allowing shipments of injera and other processed products. but this could change: the goal is to produce enough teff for domestic consumption and a strong export market, according to the government’s strategy.mama fresh is a family firm that has been selling injera to top restaurants and hotels in the ethiopian capital for years. it also ships the flatbread to finland, germany, sweden and the us, primarily for consumption by diaspora communities. but, the company has its eye on the gluten-free market. it aims to double exports to america in 2014 and will soon start producing teff-based pizzas, bread and cookies.“typically, these products are going to go through many hands before they reach the shelves of sainsbury’s or wherever. there are profit margins at every step and small farmers are not necessarily well placed to bargain with the bigger traders,” says david hallam, trade and markets director at the un’s food and agriculture organization. he sees quinoa’s popularity as a cautionary tale of how export opportunities can be a mixed blessing for poor countries.regassa feyissa, an ethiopian agricultural scientist and former head of the national institute for biodiversity, warns that, without careful planning, increased teff production for export may displace other important crops for farmers. and, efforts to boost production could benefit business interests at the expense of small farmers.with little ethiopian teff on the international market, farmers in the us have started planting the crop. farmers in europe, israel and australia have also experimented with it.kebede says she gets her grain from farms in southern europe, though she would prefer to source it from ethiopia. “teff is second nature to an ethiopian, so who better to supply it? we have this sought-after grain being grown in the country, so why can’t an ethiopian farmer benefit from this?”
advanced	it is hard to tell exactly where the noise is coming from, but impossible to miss it from anywhere in damascus: all day and night you can hear the dull thud and boom of artillery, rockets or planes pounding rebel positions – the sound of war getting closer to syria’s capital. but just over two years into the syrian crisis – the longest and bloodiest of the arab uprisings – ignoring the sound of death and destruction nearby has become the new normal for damascenes.over the weekend, men could be seen puffing on water pipes in a palm-shaded park, children playing between the flowerbeds and couples chatting on benches as the unmistakable thunderclap of high explosive could be heard a few miles away – smoke rising between the minarets of a nearby ottoman-era mosque. no one seemed to notice.“actually you do get used to it after a while,” said george, an it technician from a village on the coast. “but you never know exactly what they are hitting.” that usually becomes clear later from video clips posted by opposition media outlets on youtube.the sinister background noise is doubly disturbing because the government tries so hard to preserve a jaunty air of business as usual. “as you can see, everything here is fine but we have to hit the terrorists, these extremists,” an army officer announced. an official, whose route home has come under attack from rebels in daraya, said: “if i was afraid, i would just shut my door and stay inside. i have to work and i am not afraid. if i don’t defend my country, who will?”ordinary citizens, in private conversation, are less defiant. in the centre of town, a shopkeeper complained sadly that his baby daughter cries at the sound of shelling. zeina, a twenty-something student, fears becoming desensitized to suffering – and perhaps to danger too. “in the beginning, when there started to be explosions, i used to have nightmares,” she reflected. “now i can sleep through anything.”and, the risks are multiplying even closer to home. in sabaa bahrat square, in what was supposed to be the safest part of damascus, a car bomb detonated, leaving a blackened concrete facade, broken windows and mangled metal as well as blast damage to the imposing structure of the syrian central bank next door.mourning notices for two of the 15 victims – muhammad al-sufi and manal al-tahan – are stuck to the wall opposite. scruffy, machine-gun toting militiamen mill around the square, often used for televised pro-regime rallies with civil servants bussed in en masse to chant slogans under giant banners of president bashar al-assad.that bombing was not the worst damascus has experienced as the situation has deteriorated. in february, 80 people, including schoolchildren, reportedly died near the ruling ba’ath party headquarters in mazraa. the crater is still visible, marked by an enormous patch of fresh asphalt on the main road going north. “i live nearby but luckily i wasn’t there,” recalled munir, a university lecturer.mortar bombs, fired from rebel-held areas now within easy range of the city, have become an ominous novelty. the bombs killed 15 students in a university cafeteria on 28 march. the intended target is thought to have been a government building.security measures have intensified since the devastating bombing of the national security crisis cell in july 2012, when four of assad’s most senior aides were killed. concrete blast barriers – often painted in the syrian flag’s black, red and white – now protect official premises, not just the military or defence installations that are obvious targets. the iranian embassy in mezze, its turquoise mosaic front giving an exotic glimpse of isfahan or shiraz, looks like a fortress. “the regime did manage to set up a ring of steel round damascus,” a foreign diplomat said. “but for whatever reason the perimeter is starting to be punctured and that brings home the reality of the war.”all this means that moving around has become difficult, unpredictable and time-consuming – another aspect of the new normal across an understandably nervous city. checkpoints on main roads funnel traffic for id checks and baggage searches with handheld explosive detectors – vital to stop future bombers. only drivers with an official security clearance can use special fast lanes to avoid the wait.it is hard, however, to avoid the question on everyone’s mind: will there be a battle for damascus – the world’s oldest continually inhabited city, as the guidebooks say – like the one that has so damaged aleppo? parts of the city already feel like a war zone: its ritziest hotel is eerily deserted though many rooms are being used as offices by international agencies drawn by the deepening crisis – blue helmets and flak jackets piled up on persian carpets in an ornate reception room, white un vehicles parked behind the blast barriers outside. the streets empty soon after 9pm.one view is that the fight for syria’s capital is coming, but not quite yet – in the summer perhaps, some predict, when the rebels have consolidated their gains in the south. others argue that outright victory by either side is unlikely and hope for a political solution imposed from abroad. but few here seem to expect things to get any better.
