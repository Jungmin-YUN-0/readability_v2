intermediate	police and intelligence agencies around the world have, for almost 100 years, used lie detectors to help convict criminals or find spies and traitors.but the polygraph could soon be defunct. researchers in britain and the netherlands have developed a new method that has a success rate, in tests, of over 70%. this new method could be in use in police stations around the world within a decade. it doesn’t monitor facial tics, talking too much or waving of arms, which are all signs that someone is lying. the new method monitors full-body motion, which can show that the person is feeling guilty.the polygraph is widely used in the us in criminal cases and for security clearance for the fbi and cia but is much less popular in europe. many people in the scientific and legal communities do not believe that it is reliable. by contrast, the new method has performed well in experiments.the basic thought is that liars fidget more and so the use of an all-body motion suit – the kind used in films to create computer-generated characters – will record this. the suit has 17 sensors that register movement up to 120 times per second in three dimensions for 23 joints.one of the research team, ross anderson, professor of security engineering at cambridge university, said that years of research show that an interviewer will know whether someone is telling the truth, and not lies, in only about 55 times out of 100he said the new method, by contrast, was right over 70% of the time. and he was confident they would be able to do better. in some tests, the team has already achieved more than 80%.anderson said: “guilty people fidget more and we can measure this.”anderson added that the research had a special significance at this time because of a recent us senate report on torture by the cia. there are problems with torture from a moral point of view but it is also a very unreliable way of getting accurate information. “we have known for a long time that torture does not work,” anderson said. the new method offers a good alternative to interviews.the research paper was written by dr sophie van der zee of cambridge university, professor ronald poppe of utrecht university, professor paul taylor of lancaster university and anderson.the polygraph was created in 1921 by policeman john larson. it records changes in pulse, blood pressure, sweating and breathing to find out whether someone is lying.in movies, the polygraph is always right, but, in 1998, the us supreme court ruled that there was no consensus that the polygraph was reliable. this conclusion was supported by the us national academy of scientists in 2003.the experiment carried out by anderson and his colleagues involved 180 students and employees at lancaster university – half of the people were told to tell the truth and half to lie. they were each paid £7.50 for their participation in the 70-minute experiment, involving two tests.some were interviewed about a computer game never end, which they played for seven minutes. others lied about playing the game – they had only seen notes about it.the second test involved a lost wallet containing £5. some were asked to bring the wallet to a lost-and-found box. others hid it and lied about it.“overall, we correctly guessed whether 82.2% (truths: 88.9%; lies: 75.6%) of the interviewees were telling the truth or lying based on the movements in their individual limbs,” the report says.anderson said: “first, we looked at how much different body parts showed that someone was lying. we found that liars wave their arms more, but this is only at the 60% level that you can get from a polygraph.“the success came when we looked at total body motion. that tells truth from lies over 70% of the time and we believe we can improve it even more by combining it with optimal questioning techniques.”another advantage is that total body motion is mostly the same in people who have different cultural backgrounds and different levels of anxiety – these things confuse other lie-detection technologies, anderson said.the use of all-body suits is expensive – they cost about £30,000 – and they can be uncomfortable, so anderson and his colleagues are now studying low-cost alternatives. these include using motion-sensing technology from computer games, such as the kinect devices developed by microsoft for the xbox.anderson admits that intelligence agencies such as the cia could teach agents how to trick the full-body motion method by keeping their bodies completely still. but he said that in itself would be a giveaway.nannan
intermediate	thousands of people protested on australiaõs beaches against a shark cull that is being carried out in western australia. they called on the stateõs prime minister to end the policy, and rspca australia and virgin atlantic owner richard branson spoke out against it. the catching and killing of sharks longer than three metres began after what the state government called an òunprecedentedó number of shark attacks on western australiaõs coast. a 35-year-old surfer, killed in november 2013, was the sixth person to die from a shark attack in two years.however, the whole of australia has had an average of just one shark-related death a year for the last 50 years. kate faehrmann, of the sea shepherd conservation society, said from a protest in the state capital, perth: òweõve always said that this policy wonõt work. drumlines used to catch the sharks kill sharks whether theyõre one, two, three metres or more, as well as dolphins, turtles and other things. thatõs why the community doesnõt want it.óthousands of people protested on beaches in the cities of perth, sydney and adelaide, and at beaches in victoria and queensland. faehrmann said the protests had shown that australians wanted sharks protected: òwhatõs amazing is so many people in australia love sharks. this has demonstrated something about the national psyche; that, despite all the fear, thousands of people are coming out across the country to say, ôthatõs their ocean. we respect them, we love them and we donõt want them killed.õó anthony joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharkõs mouth, said: òthe number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference.óthe state government has refused to say how many sharks have been killed, though there have been reports of sharks smaller than three metres being released after getting caught on drumlines,  oating drums  xed to the sea bed with bait hanging on hooks underneath them. conservationists say there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, because no previous cull has only used drumlines. researchers at the university of western australia say the increased number of shark attacks in the state is probably because the state has the fastest-growing population in australia, not because of a rising number of sharks.richard peirce, of the uk-based conservation charity, the shark trust, said that the cull would be ineffective and could bring more predators towards the coast. òthe activity in western australia is compounding the human tragedy of shark attacks. it is very sad that a government has ignored the best advice and chosen an approach that is ineffective and counterproductive,ó he said. òpeople often donõt consider that that drumlines are indiscriminate ð even if monitored through the day, leaving the lines in at night has the potential to attract other predators into the area, attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured.óworldwide, in 2012, there were 80 attacks by sharks, seven of which were fatal, compared to nearly 100m sharks killed by humans each year. rspca australia said in a statement that it believes the cull is unjusti ed. òthere is no evidence that the increase in attacks is a result of increasing shark numbers. instead, it is consistent with a changing population and human behaviour; that is, there are greater numbers of people in the water,ó it said.richard branson said the policy was not working. òiõm sure one of the reasons western australia premier, colin barnett, did it was because he was thinking it would encourage tourism. itõs going to do quite the reverse, i think. youõre advertising a problem that doesnõt exist in a major way and youõre deterring people from coming to perth and your beautiful countryside around it. all youõre going to achieve, i think, is to worry people unnecessarily.ó
intermediate	galina zaglumyonova was woken in her flat in central chelyabinsk by an enormous explosion that blew in the balcony windows and shattered pots containing her houseplants. when she jumped out of bed, she could see a huge vapour trail hanging in the morning sky and hear car alarms from the street below.“i didn’t understand what was going on,” said zaglumyonova. “there was a big explosion and then a series of little explosions. my first thought was that it was a plane crash.”what she had actually witnessed was a ten-tonne meteorite that fell to earth in a series of fireballs just after sunrise.officials said almost 1,200 people had been injured, with more than 40 taken to hospital – most as a result of flying glass shattered by the sonic boom created by the meteorite’s fall. there were no reported deaths.the meteorite entered the atmosphere travelling at a speed of at least 33,000mph and broke up into pieces between 18 and 32 miles above the ground, according to a statement from the russian academy of sciences.the event caused panic in chelyabinsk, a city of more than one million people to the south of russia’s ural mountains. a video showed the pieces of meteorite glowing more brightly as they approached the moment of impact. the vapour trail was visible for hundreds of miles around, including in neighbouring kazakhstan.tatyana bets was at work in the reception area of a hospital clinic in the centre of the city when the meteorite hit. “first we noticed the wind, and then the room was filled with a very bright light and we could see a cloud of smoke in the sky,” she said. then, after a few minutes, the explosions came.at least three craters were discovered, according to the ministry of the interior. one crater was more than six metres wide and another piece of the meteorite broke through the thick ice of a nearby lake.in chelyabinsk itself, schools and universities were closed and many other staff told to go home early. about 200 children were among the injured.a steady stream of lightly injured people, most suffering cuts from flying glass, came into the clinic where bets works. she said a nearby building for college students was particularly badly affected and many of the students were brought in. “there were a lot of girls in shock. some were very pale and many of them fainted,” she said.early estimates suggested more than 100,000 square metres of glass had been broken and 3,000 buildings hit. the total cost of the damage in the city was being valued at more than one billion roubles (£20m).the meteorite over chelyabinsk arrived less than a day before asteroid 2012 da14 was expected to pass earth very closely (about 17,510 miles). but experts said the two events were not connected.there were lots of rumours and conspiracy theories, however, in the first few hours after the incident. reports on russian state television and in local media suggested that the meteorite was blown apart by local air defence units at an altitude of more than 15 miles.the ultra-nationalist leader of russia’s liberal democrat party, vladimir zhirinovsky, said it was not a meteorite but military action by the united states. “it’s not a meteorite falling – it’s a test of new american weapons,” zhirinovsky said.some were quick to take advantage. enterprising people were offering pieces of meteorite for sale through internet sites within a few hours of the impact.president vladimir putin and the prime minister, dmitry medvedev, were informed about the incident, and putin called a meeting with the head of the emergency situations ministry. “it’s proof that not only are economies vulnerable but the whole planet,” medvedev said at an economic forum in siberia.nan
intermediate	facebook has lost millions of users per month in its biggest markets. in the last six months, facebook has lost nearly 9m monthly visitors in the us and 2m in the uk.studies suggest that its expansion in the us, uk and other major european countries has peaked. in the last month, the world’s largest social network has lost 6m us visitors, a 4% fall, according to analysis firm socialbakers. in the uk, 1.4m fewer users visited in march, a fall of 4.5%.users are also turning off in canada, spain, france, germany and japan, where facebook is extremely popular.“the problem is that, in the us and uk, most people who want to sign up for facebook have already done it,” said new media specialist ian maude at enders analysis. people get bored, he says, and they “like to try something new”.alternative social networks have seen surges in popularity with younger people. instagram, the photo-sharing site, got 30m new users in the 18 months before facebook bought the business.path, the mobile phone-based social network founded by former facebook employee dave morin, which only allows its users to have 150 friends, is gaining 1m users a week. it has recently topped 9m users, with 500,000 venezuelans downloading the app in a single weekend.facebook is still growing fast in south america. monthly visitors in brazil were up 6% in the last month to 70m, according to socialbakers, whose information is used by facebook advertisers. india has seen a 4% rise to 64m – still only a fraction of the country’s population, so there is room for more growth.but in developed markets, other people watching facebook are reporting declines.analysts at jefferies bank saw global numbers of visitors to facebook peak at 1.05bn a month in january, before falling by 20m in february. numbers rose again in april. the network has now lost nearly 2m visitors in the uk since december, according to research firm nielsen, with its 27m total the same as a year ago.the number of minutes americans spend on facebook appears to be falling, too. the total was 121 billion minutes in december 2012, but that fell to 115 billion minutes in february, according to comscore.as facebook itself has warned, the time spent on its pages from those sitting in front of personal computers is decreasing fast because people now prefer to use their smartphones and tablets.although smartphone minutes have doubled in a year, to 69 a month, that growth may not compensate for dwindling desktop usage.facebook will tell investors about its performance for the quarter. wall street expects revenues of about $1.44bn, an increase from $1.06bn a year ago.shareholders will want to know how fast the number of mobile facebook users is growing, and whether advertising revenues are increasing at the same rate.mobile usage represented nearly a quarter of facebook’s advertising income at the end of 2012, and the network had 680m mobile users a month in december.the company said that it might be losing “younger users” to “other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, facebook”.facebook founder mark zuckerberg has created a series of new initiatives designed to appeal to smartphone users. one initiative, facebook home, is software that can be downloaded onto android phones to feed news and photos from friends – and advertising – directly to the owner’s locked home screen.nan
intermediate	to tourists, amsterdam still seems very liberal. recently the city’s mayor assured them that the city’s marijuana-selling coffee shops would stay open despite a new national law to prevent drug tourism. but the dutch capital’s plans to send nuisance neighbours to “scum villages” made from shipping containers may damage its reputation for tolerance.the mayor, eberhard van der laan, says his controversial new £810,000 policy to deal with antisocial behaviour is to protect victims of abuse and homophobia. the camps, where antisocial families will be rehoused for three to six months, have been called “scum villages” because the policy is similar to proposals from geert wilders, the far-right politician, who last year said that “repeat offenders” should be “sent to a village for scum”.bartho boer, a spokesman for the mayor, says that the plans are not illiberal. “we want to defend the liberal values of amsterdam,” he says. “we want everyone to be who he and she is – whether they are gay and lesbian or resist violence and are then victims of harassment. we as a society want to defend them.” according to boer, the villages are not for “a problem neighbour who has the stereo too loud on saturday night” but “people who are extremely violent and intimidating and in a clear situation where a victim is being harassed again and again”.people found guilty of causing “extreme havoc” will be evicted and put in “basic” temporary homes, including converted shipping containers in industrial areas of the city. “we call it a living container,” says boer. housing antisocial families in these units, which have showers and kitchens and have been used as student accommodation, will mean that they are not “rewarded” for their behaviour by being put in better accommodation.dutch newspaper the parool has written that in the 19th century troublemakers were moved to villages in drenthe and overijssel, which rapidly became slums. but boer insists that the government has learned from past mistakes and is not planning to house antisocial families together.it would be more accurate to call them “scum houses” than scum villages, says boer, “because we don’t want to put more than one of these families in the same area”. after a maximum of six months in these houses, in different parts of the city, the families will be found permanent homes. the city government expects to move around ten families a year into this programme, which starts in 2013.the temporary accommodation will be heavily policed, but antisocial families will also have access to doctors, social workers and parole officers. “they are taken care of so the whole situation is not going to repeat at the new house they are in,” says boer.

intermediate	scientists have implanted a false memory in the brains of mice in an experiment that they hope will help to explain why people ‘remember’ events or experiences that have never happened.false memories are a major problem with witness statements in courts of law. evidence that eyewitnesses give often leads to guilty verdicts, but later the convictions are overturned when dna or some other evidence is used.susumu tonagawa, a neuroscientist at the massachusetts institute of technology (mit), and his team wanted to study how these false memories might form in the human brain, so they encoded memories in the brains of mice by manipulating individual neurons. memories of experiences we have had are made from several elements including records of objects, space and time. these records are encoded in physical and chemical changes in brain cells and the connections between them. according to tonagawa, both false and genuine memories seem to use the same brain mechanisms.in the experiment, tonagawa’s team put the mice in a box and allowed them to explore it. as they did so, their brain cells were producing a memory protein. the next day, the same mice were put in a second box and given a small electric shock, to encode a fear response. at the same time, the researchers shone light into the mouse brains to activate their memories of the first box. that way, the mice learned to associate fear of the electric shock with the memory of the first box.in the final part of the experiment, the team put the mice back in the first box. the mice froze, showing a typical fear response, even though they had never been shocked in that box.a similar process may happen when powerful false memories are created in humans. “humans are very imaginative animals,” said tonagawa. “ so, just like our mouse, it is quite possible we can associate what we happen to have in our mind with bad or good events. in other words, there could be a false association of what you have in your mind rather than what is happening to you.”he added: “our study showed that the false memory and the genuine memory are based on very similar, almost identical, brain mechanisms. it is difficult for the person with false memories to distinguish between them. we hope our future findings along this line will show legal experts how unreliable memory can be.”chris french, of the university of london, is a leading researcher in false memories in people. he said that the latest results were an important first step in understanding them. “memory researchers have always recognized that memory does not work like a video camera, recording all the details of anything we experience. instead, it is a reconstructive process, which involves building a specific memory from fragments of real memory traces of the original event, but also possibly including information from other sources.”he warned that the false memories created in the mice in the experiments were far simpler than the complex false memories that have caused controversy within psychology and psychiatry – for example, false memories of childhood sexual abuse, abduction by aliens, or “past lives”. “such rich false memories will clearly involve many brain systems and we are still a long way from understanding the processes involved in their formation at the neuronal level,” he said.mark stokes, a neuroscientist at oxford university, said the experiments were a great achievement but that it was important to put them into perspective. “although the results seem to show that new memories were formed by the artificial stimulation (rather than the actual environment), this kind of phenomenon is still a long way from most people’s idea of memory,” he said.the mouse models created by the mit team will help scientists ask more and more complex questions about memories in people. “now that we can change the contents of memories in the brain, we can begin asking questions that were once the realm of philosophy,” said steve ramirez, a colleague of tonagawa’s at mit. “are there multiple conditions that lead to the formation of false memories? can false memories be artificially created? what about false memories for more than just contexts – false memories for objects, food or other mice? these are the seemingly sci-fi questions that can now be experimentally tackled in the lab.”as the technology develops, said french, scientists need to think about its uses carefully. “in whatever way we implant false memories, we need to be very aware of the ethical issues raised by such procedures – the potential for abuse of such techniques cannot be overstated.”nan
intermediate	governments across europe dream of  nding a magic solution to rising unemployment. but, in the hardest-hit parts of the eu, unemployment continues to rise and the talk does little to reduce the number of people without work.now, in a corner of italy, one mayor thinks he has found an answer to his townõs serious lack of work. valter piscedda, the mayor of elmas, a small town near sardiniaõs capital, cagliari, wants to pay residents to leave. the council will pay for ten unemployed locals to take intensive english lessons, get on a cheap  ight and look for jobs elsewhere in europe.òthis idea is a result of common sense and experience,ó the mayor told the guardian. òover the past year and a half ð especially in the past few months ð i have been seeing young people, almost every day, who are despairing about their search for work. some ask for help in  nding it here. others have tried everything and are so discouraged that they no longer want to stay and wait. and they want to go and gain work experience abroad; life experience, too.òso, my idea was this: put everything in place so that those who want to gain experience abroad are able to,ó he said.as the national economy continues to falter, sardinia, along with much of southern and central italy, is struggling with high unemployment. unemployment was at 17.7% in the second quarter of 2014, according to italyõs national institute of statistics, istat. more than 54% of people under 25 are out of work.for the adesso parto (now iõm leaving) programme, elmasõs council will give û12,000 on a  rst-come,  rst-served basis to applicants aged between 18 and 50. they just have to be out of work and have lived in the town for three years. they do not have to be university educated and their annual income must be no more than û15,000.the idea of encouraging people to leave is sensitive at a time when huge numbers of italians ð many of them bright young graduates ð are leaving their country every year. but piscedda, who belongs to the democratic party of the prime minister, matteo renzi, believes that the people he is sending away might return òand give me back 100 times what they were givenó. more importantly, he wants the scheme to help those most in need.òitõs a programme for those with no other resource; itõs the last-chance saloon. it will allow them the dignity of not having to ask a friend for money or put burdens on families,ó he said.earlier in 2014, he added, the council launched a scheme for businesses ð they were given  nancial incentives to hire young workers from elmas. òwe advertised 20 of these positions,ó he said. òwe got 120 applications.óin elmas, the scheme has got mixed reactions. òthe reality is that there is little work here,ó said alessandro macis. òthe opportunity to go abroad to learn about the workplace and experience other cultures can be very worthwhile. the son of a friend of mine who didnõt study much is in london and heõs really  nding his way. he started as a waiter. now, heõs a cook and heõs learning english.óothers were perplexed. i heard about it but i thought it was strange. if you have that money to pay for people to go away, why dont you use that money to keep them here? said consuelo melis, who works behind the bar in a local cafe. on twitter, one of many reactions was disbelief. the states admission of defeat, commented marco patavino. institutions are raising the white  ag, remarked carlo mazzaggio.piscedda, however, says of his online critics: òprobably, they are people that arenõt in need ... every day, i deal with peopleõs problems and i have to do something to try to solve them. these people, if they had an alternative, they wouldnõt be asking for help.òthe work i can create, as mayor, is temporary. i can have a piazza cleaned. i can have it cleaned again. i can have the streets cleaned. but these are all temporary things that give nothing beyond that little bit of money for a few months. i want to go beyond that.ó
intermediate	they may not know who steve jobs was or even how to tie their own shoelaces, but the average six-year-old child understands more about digital technology than a 45-year-old adult, according to a new report.the arrival of broadband in the year 2000 has created a generation of digital natives, ofcom (which checks standards in the uk communications industries) says in its annual study of british consumers. born in the new millennium, these children are learning how to operate smartphones or tablets before they are able to talk.òthese younger people are shaping communications,ó said jane rumble, who is head of media research at ofcom. òas a result of growing up in the digital age, they are developing completely different communication habits from older generations, even compared to the 16-to-24 age group.ó800 children and 2,000 adults took ofcomõs òdigital quotientó, or dq, test, which attempts to gauge awareness of and self-con dence around gadgets from tablets to smart watches, knowledge of superfast internet, 4g mobile- phone networks and mobile apps.among 6- to 7-year-olds, who have grown up with youtube, spotify music streaming and online television, the average dq score was 98, higher than for those aged between 45 and 49, who scored an average of 96. digital understanding peaks between 14 and 15 years old, with a dq of 113, and then drops gradually throughout adulthood, before falling rapidly in old age.people can now test their digital knowledge with a short version of the questionnaire that will give anyone a dq score, along with advice on how to improve their understanding and protect themselves and their families online.the ways in which millennial children contact each other and consume entertainment are so different from previous generations that forecasters now believe their preferences to be a better indication of the future than the preferences of trendsetting young adults.the most remarkable change is in time spent talking by phone. two decades ago, teenagers spent their evenings monopolizing the home telephone line, talking about love affairs and friendships in conversations that lasted for hours.for those aged 12 to 15, phone calls account for just 3% of time spent communicating through any device. for all adults, this rises to 20% and, for young adults, it is still three times as high at 9%. todayõs children do the majority of their remote socializing by sending written messages or through shared photographs and videos. òthe millennium generation is losing its voice,ó ofcom claims.over 90% of their device-time is message based, chatting on social networks like facebook, sending instant messages through services like whatsapp or even sending traditional mobile- phone text messages. just 2% of childrenõs time using devices is spent emailing, compared to 33% for adults.away from their phones, 12- to 15-year-olds have a very different relationship with other media, too. a digital seven-day diary shows live television accounts for just half of viewing for this age group, compared to nearly 70% for all adults. they spend 20% of their time viewing short video clips, for example on youtube, or news clips on facebook and other social sites. the rest of their viewing is shared between dvds, streamed content through net ix or itunes and recorded television programmes.young adults aged 16 to 24 are big media consumers. however, they consume hardly any live radio or print-based media.younger people are also moving away from live television and moving to streaming and catch- up services. even among adults, television is becoming less important. television viewing among 16- to 24-year-olds has been dipping each year since 2010, but 2013 was the  rst year that researchers found that viewing fell in all age groups. the theory is that easy-to-use tablet computers with large screens have brought many older people online.nannan
intermediate	a girl born today in the uk can expect to live nearly to the age of 82 on average and her brother will live to 78. they would have a longer life in andorra (85 and 79 respectively) but will live a little longer than in the us (81 and 76). if they lived in the central african republic, they would die in middle age (49 and 44). however, almost everywhere in the world, with the exception of countries such as lesotho, which have experienced hiv and violence, lifespans are lengthening. and the best news is that small children are much less likely to die than they were forty years ago. there has been a drop in deaths in under-fives of nearly 60%, from 16.4 million in 1970 to 6.8 million in 2010.this last statistic provides justification for the enormous project that the institute of health metrics and evaluation (ihme) in seattle has led over the past five years, involving nearly 500 researchers, to assess the global effects of disease. knowing how many children die and from what cause allows the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive. there are many lessons to be learnt from the enormous database they have put together, which will help global organizations and individual governments to better care for us all.the project was a big task and is not without controversy. ihme has been very radical in some of its methods. where they did not have death registries or medical records, for instance, they have taken evidence from verbal autopsies – deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family. the most surprising result has been the malaria figure. ihme said 1.2 million die of the disease every year – twice as many as previously thought. the big increase is in adult deaths. it is commonly believed that malaria kills mostly children under five.“the way i was taught as a doctor and everybody else is taught is that, in malarial areas, you become semi-immune as an adult,” said dr christopher murray, ihme director. “we originally went with that opinion but there has been a change as we have become more empirical, following the data. african doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot.” but, he adds, their fever could be something else. the findings have led to further studies.although margaret chan, director general of the world health organization, gave the ihme study a warm official welcome, some of the staff are cautious. “we need to be very careful in assessing the validity [of the figures],” said colin mathers, a senior scientist. “we need to wait to be persuaded by evidence.” his colleague dr tiers boerma, director of one who department, added: “people should understand that some of the numbers are very different and the who can’t go with any academic publication that states a different number.” however, said mathers, “ihme has pushed the envelope with some of these analyses and that is stimulating”. one of the main themes, said murray, was “incredibly rapid change in the main causes of death and the speed of that change is a lot faster than we expected it to be”.reduced fertility and longer life have led to a rise in the average age of the world’s population in a decade from 26 years old to almost 30. the change has been dramatic in latin america, for instance, where countries like brazil and paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010. that is a 35-year increase in the average age of death over four decades. “in a place like brazil, the speed of change is so fast that most institutions are not able to deal with it,” murray said.a second factor is the move outside africa from communicable diseases and the common causes of mother and baby deaths to what are sometimes termed “lifestyle” diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer – some of which have significant genetic triggers. that change has been particularly marked in latin america, the middle east and south-east and even south asia, he said.the third big finding was, murray said, “a surprise to us”. there is a lot of disability and it has a big effect on people who are living longer but not healthier lives. “the main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you,” he said. they were mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, and disorders, such as arthritis and lower back pain, anaemia, sight and hearing loss and skin disease. in addition, there was substance abuse. “the numbers for these are not going down over time,” he said. “we are making no progress in reducing these conditions.”
elementary	prince harry has left afghanistan at the end of a four-month tour. he spoke about the frustrations of being a royal who doesn’t want a lot of public attention.he also talked about his feelings for some parts of the media and described how his father constantly told him to behave more like a member of the royal family.as a commander of an apache helicopter, the prince said he had shot at the taliban. he said he was only doing his job.in interviews during his time based at camp bastion in helmand province, the prince, known as captain wales in the army, explained his ‘three mes’. “one in the army, one socially in my own private time and one with the family.”he admitted he sometimes disappointed people and also himself with his silly behaviour. he said he was “probably too much army and not enough prince”, but he said he was entitled to privacy, too.in another interview, he criticized the media, especially the sun, the daily mail and the daily telegraph. he said he was very annoyed by articles that compare his role as an apache co-pilot gunner to spitfire crews during the second world war. “no, it’s not like that at all,” he said.the prince said he didn’t like the media because of the treatment of his family when “i was very small”. he said that he read the stories written about him. “of course i read them,” the prince said. “if there’s a story and somebody writes something about me, i want to know what they said. but it just upsets me and makes me angry that people can write those things. not just about me, but about everything and everybody. my father always says, ‘don’t read it’.”when he was asked if he felt more comfortable being captain wales than prince harry, his reply was revealing. “definitely. i’ve always been like that. my father’s always trying to tell me about who i am and things like that. but it’s very easy to forget about who i am when i am in the army. everyone’s wearing the same uniform and doing the same kind of thing. i get on well with the lads and i enjoy my job. it really is as simple as that.”before he went to afghanistan, the prince was photographed naked in las vegas at a private party. harry said he had disappointed himself and other people, but also blamed the media. “at the end of the day i was in a private area and there should be a certain amount of privacy that one should expect.”when he was asked why he and his brother liked helicopters, he said, “probably because you can only fit a few people in a helicopter, so no one can follow us, like you guys.”nannannan
elementary	a subway system has billions of inhabitants: the bacteria of swiss cheese and kimchi, plague and human skin. now, for the  rst time, scientists have started to study the bacteria in a cityõs subway ð and they have found many interesting results.dr christopher mason, a scientist at weill cornell medical college, led a team that tested the new york city subway system for 18 months. his team found meningitis at times square, a trace of anthrax on a train carriage and bacteria that cause plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown manhattan.the team said the  ndings of plague and anthrax are not serious. they said that there was only a very small trace of anthrax, that rats probably carried the plague and that no one has become ill with plague in new york for years.òthe results do not show that people in new york are at risk,ó the study says. in fact, most of the bacteria the team found are harmless to humans.some of the results were not a surprise. they showed that people òshould wash their handsó, mason said. he also said that they found many bacteria that are helpful, like the bacteria used for making cheese.all around the subway, there were bacteria from cheeses ð brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella found on new york pizza. the bacteria of swiss cheese were found in midtown manhattan and the  nancial district, and the bacteria used to make kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the  nancial district and bay ridge.bacteria that can cause illness and infections were very common. bacteria that cause diarrhoea and nausea, as well as e.coli, and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city. the scientists found bacteria that cause tetanus in soho and bacteria that cause dysentery at a station in the bronx and in harlem.mason and his team collected more than 1,000 samples from all of new yorkõs 466 open subway stations. they found 15,152 different species, nearly half of which were bacteria.the good news, they said, is that these bacteria are not spreading sickness or disease in new york and that the subway and city are as safe as everyone thought.òin fact,ó mason added, òiõve become much more confident riding the subway.ómany  ndings made sense: stations like grand central and times square, where there are more people, had more bacteria. the bronx, with its diverse neighbourhoods and stations, had the greatest diversity of bacteria; staten island, with just three stops, had the lowest diversity of bacteria.the researchers found sea and  sh bacteria at south ferry, a station that  ooded during hurricane sandy.the next steps, mason said, are studies of other cities, which have begun in paris, sa_o paolo and shanghai. they also want to do more studies of new york. he said he hoped the research would help health of cials to prevent and track diseases.nannannan
elementary	the us senate intelligence committee recently agreed a bill to allow the national security agency (nsa) to continue to collect us phone records. but it would also make the nsa’s activities more transparent. the committee chairwoman, dianne feinstein, introduced the bill. it allows the nsa to continue to collect the telephone metadata of millions of americans. it also allows the government to keep the data. eleven people voted for the bill and four people voted against it. the full senate will now vote on the bill.the bill allows analysts to search through the data if they believe that someone may be involved in international terrorism. the bill also allows the nsa to continue to watch foreigners who come to the us if they enter the country for less than 72 hours.senator patrick leahy introduced another bill (the usa freedom act). this bill would stop the collection of phone records in the us. feinstein defended the nsa phone data collection programme, but said that people didn’t trust the nsa anymore. “the nsa programme is legal and i believe it makes us safer,” she said. “but we can, and should, do more to increase transparency and build public support for privacy protections.”feinstein said the bill would also make a number of improvements to transparency and checks on the nsa – for example, if the foreign intelligence surveillance act (fisa) gets some data and then somebody looks at that data without permission, they could spend up to ten years in prison.feinstein says she strongly supports the nsa’s main us programme. “i think many people don’t understand this nsa database programme. it is very important and helps to protect this country,” she said.independent legal experts said they were worried about the intelligence committee’s bill. elizabeth goitein of the brennan center for justice said: “the intelligence committee bill and the usa freedom act are two opposing visions of the relationship between americans who do not break the law and the national security state. the most important question is: should the government have some reason to suspect wrongdoing before collecting americans’ most personal information? leahy says yes; feinstein says no.”democratic committee member ron wyden said that recent worries about nsa spying on foreign leaders took attention away from the more important problem of the nsa checking the data of people in the us. “my top priority is ending the collection of data on millions and millions of innocent americans.”feinstein said that she completely disagreed with the foreign leader spying that the nsa does, for example on german chancellor angela merkel. but feinstein agrees with the nsa’s collection of americans’ phone records.“americans are making it clear, that they never – repeat, never – agreed to give up their freedom so that the country could appear to be safer,” wyden said. “we’re just going to continue to fight this battle. it’s going to be a long battle.”nannannan
elementary	women have traditionally had a minor role in professional football but this may be changing. france has just employed its first female professional team manager. it did not matter that it was a second-division club. it did not matter if it was, as some people suggested, just a publicity stunt for a minor team, clermont foot 63. clermont is 14th out of the 20 teams in its league at the moment.what mattered was that they gave helena costa the top job. this has made football history because she is the first female manager in the top two divisions of any professional european league. “as a woman, it’s made me happy,” said véronique soulier, president of the club’s supporters’ association. “when i first heard the news, i was surprised, but, then, we all agreed that it’s good news. we all agree that a woman at the head of a group of men is no bad thing.”the new manager of clermont foot 63 was born in alhandra, portugal and has a master’s degree in sports science. she is also a uefa-licensed coach. she previously coached benfica’s male youth teams, the qatar women’s team and, more recently, the iranian women’s national team.the president of clermont foot 63, claude michy, gave costa, 36, a two-year contract. michy is very good at keeping his club in the news. in 2013, he told everyone the team had signed messi. they had. not the argentinian and barcelona striker lionel messi, but junior messi enguene, a 20-year-old midfielder from cameroon.carolina morace, an italian who was the only previous woman coach of a men’s professional team, said: “i don’t know helena, but, if she has been hired by a team, then it means that she knows how to do her job. i hope that, one day, this can become normal.” morace played for italy in 153 internationals. in 1999, she became coach of the men’s team viterbese. but, after only two games, she resigned from the job because of a disagreement with the club’s owner. she added: “i see too many men, even in the women’s game, who do not have the same expertise as women but are working. and the women are not working.”raymond domenech, former manager of the french national team, said: “women know how to play football and how to manage and are good at doing it. why shouldn’t they manage men’s teams? the opposite happens and doesn’t cause any problems. it’s a natural choice and reflects our society in which women are equal to men. i say well done to president michy. i told myself that, if i took control of a club again, i’d hire a woman as my number two. michy did it first.”clermont foot 63 says that costa’s becoming the team’s manager will allow the club to enter “a new era”. on the club supporters’ website, reaction to costa’s becoming the manager was mixed. “in my opinion, it’s just a publicity stunt to get people talking about the club. i find it hard to believe she’ll be able to get the players’ respect, above all when she’s the same age as the oldest,” wrote one fan. “her cv isn’t bad, but now the question is: will she be good enough?” added another. a third wrote: “i wish her welcome and success but i think it’ll be hard for her to do well as a woman in such a macho business.”but soulier was hopeful: “hopefully, with the new manager, the club can find the motivation they don’t have at the moment,” she said. “the boys in the team can be difficult to manage. with a woman in control, maybe they will be less demanding.”if we believe costa’s reputation, she will be the person making the demands. after doing work experience at chelsea during josé mourinho’s first time as manager of the club between 2004 and 2007, people described her as “mourinho in a skirt”. costa’s comment on that description was: “like mourinho, i always want to win. in that way, yes, i’m happy to be compared with him.”nannan
elementary	a canadian man became famous because he gave a free round-the-world trip to a woman with the same name as his ex-girlfriend. the man has now returned from the trip with the woman he chose. unfortunately, people who followed the story were disappointed because the pair did not fall in love. jordan axani, a 28-year-old from toronto who started a charity, arrived back in canada with elizabeth quinn gallagher and said the pair were like brother and sister.axani became famous in 2014 when he offered an air ticket to any canadian named elizabeth gallagher. he reserved a three-week holiday with his girlfriend but they split up and he was unable to change the name on the tickets.axani’s new travelling companion, was, of course, called elizabeth gallagher. she was a 23-year-old student from cole harbour, nova scotia. this elizabeth gallagher, who calls herself quinn, replied to an online posting from axani and he chose her. before the trip, she already had a boyfriend. but people still hoped that the globetrotters might fall in love. unfortunately, they didn’t.“i’m going to be very clear,” axani said, soon after the pair returned to toronto. “the trip was never a romantic idea. it was completely platonic. i do not think of quinn in a romantic way at all. she is a good friend. i think of her as a little sister – that is all.”but it was difficult to create that brother-sister relationship. “it wasn’t easy and it wasn’t immediate. it took us about a week to really understand each other,” axani said. they made some mistakes as the pair got to know each other. “at the end of the trip, we’d developed a really great rhythm – one second, we had really funny jokes and, the next second, we knew when the other person needed time alone.”the pair did not fall in love, but axani said the trip was “fantastic”. they visited milan, venice, vienna, prague, khao lak (in thailand) and hong kong. a favourite place was prague, axani said, where they met more people than anywhere else on the trip. “during two and a half days, i think we met about 24 people. so that’s a lot of stories, that’s a lot of people and that’s a lot of love for their home city of prague.”people followed the pair on twitter and instagram, axani said. and they were even recognized in the street in hong kong. “it was an adventure. we had a great time. we learned a lot about ourselves and about each other.”axani arrived back in toronto at 3am and went directly to a meeting at his charity, a ticket forward. axani started the charity after his online posting went viral – he plans to offer round-the-world-trips to victims of abuse, cancer and war.axani also wants to turn his story into a television show or film, he said. “there’s been lots of interest from many production companies.” axani said he was not looking for his next elizabeth gallagher yet. “i’m not looking for anything. but we’ll see,” he said. “as always, life is a journey.”nan
elementary	benjamin carle is 96.9% made in france, even his underpants and socks. six ikea forks, a chinese guitar and some wall paint stopped him being called 100% french, but nobody is perfect.carle, 26, decided, in 2013, to see if it was possible to live using only french-made products for ten months as part of a television documentary.he got the idea after the minister for economic renewal, arnaud montebourg, asked the french people to buy french products.for the experiment, carle had to give up his smartphone, television, refrigerator (all made in china); his glasses (italian); his morning coffee (guatemalan) and his favourite david bowie music (british).it is lucky that his girlfriend, anaïs, and cat, loon, are both french, so he didn’t have to give them up.“i wanted to see if it was possible to do what the minister was asking us to do,” carle saidhe had just three rules: eat only food made in france, not have any contact with foreign-made products and to do it all on €1,800 a month (above the minimum wage of €1,430 to cover the extra cost of living in paris).the journalist was shocked to find out at the start of the experiment that only 4.5% of the things in his flat were made in france. everything not made in france had to go, including the lightbulbs (china) and green beans (kenya).without a refrigerator (none are made in france), he had to chill his food on the window ledge.his foreign-made clothes, including his underwear, were replaced with more expensive alternatives: french-produced underpants (€26), socks (€9), polo shirt (€75), espadrille sandals (€26), but no jeans because none are produced in france.going out with friends was a problem – no american films, no belgian beer, no sushi or pizza. when he stayed home, with no sofa for the first few months and no television, he listened to french singer michel sardou and read french novels. french wine was, of course, allowed and french-canadian singer céline dion, but not french bands such as daft punk, who sing in english.he could not use his british-made bicycle or even a french car because he discovered that the only affordable peugeot, renault and citroën cars are not made in france. so, he bought an orange mobylette moped.his computer was replaced by a qooq, a tablet that connects – slowly – to the internet and the iphone, which he swapped for an old sagem mobile.carle said his aim was to “save the french economy”. he said the experiment was part serious and part fun. he even asked a french language expert to check if he should use the word “cool” and other english words – the expert told him swap it for the nearest french alternative: “chouette”.at the end of the experiment, a special “auditor” said carle was 96.9% “made in france” and montebourg gave him a medal.carle’s conclusion: “it’s not entirely possible to live 100% ‘made in france’, particularly in terms of new technology.“this wasn’t about french nationalism or patriotism. it was trying to show that we should think about the way we buy and make different choices, and that is the same in all countries. if we want to save jobs and industries, we should support them.“a t-shirt is more expensive in france but i can be sure it has been made by workers who are correctly paid and have good working conditions. i cannot be sure about a cheaper t-shirt produced in asia or morocco. people could do more as consumers.”nannannannannannannannan

elementary	more than 100,000 people went onto the streets in brazil to show their anger at violent police, poor public services and high costs for the world cup.the demonstrations in rio de janeiro, são paulo, brasilia, belem, belo horizonte and salvador started peacefully, but there were some clashes with police and people set fire to cars and buses.people complained that police used rubber bullets, tear gas and violent beatings.happening at the start of the football confederations cup, the rallies brought together people who are angry with the high costs and poor quality of public services, the large amounts of money spent on international sporting events, low standards of health care, inequality and corruption.most of the demonstrations were peaceful, but several police were hurt, at least one car was burned and windows were broken.people were demonstrating for different reasons. “we are here because we hate the government. they do nothing for us,” said oscar josé santos, 19 years old.“i’m an architect but i have been unemployed for six months. there must be something wrong with this country,” said nadia al husin.at a smaller rally in brasilia, demonstrators entered the high-security area of the national congress. several climbed onto the roof.in belo horizonte, police clashed with protesters who tried to get into a football stadium, where there was a confederations cup match between nigeria and tahiti.in porto alegre, demonstrators set fire to a bus and, in curitiba, protesters tried to enter the office of the state governor. there were also rallies in belem, salvador and other places.in são paulo, there were large groups of people but the marches were peaceful.most protesters were young and, for many, it was their first experience of such a giant rally. “my generation has never experienced this,” said thiago firbida, a student. “since the dictatorship, brazilians have never demonstrated like this. they did not believe they had a reason to. but now brazil once again has problems, with a constant rise in prices, so people are finally reacting.”brazil’s demonstrations have been given special names – the “vinegar revolution” (because police arrested people for carrying vinegar to stop the effects of tear gas), the “20-cent revolution” (because of the bus price rise) and the passe livre (because of the demand for free public transport).some said the protests did not feel brazilian but they were liberating. “our politicians need to see the strength we have as one people. brazilians are usually too nice; they enjoy partying, not protesting, but something is changing,” said deli borsari, a 53-year-old yoga teacher.after people heard about the costs of new and improved stadiums on the news, the confederations cup football tournament has been one of the reasons for the protests. before saturday’s match in brasilia, groups of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police. frightened japanese supporters ran from the area holding their children, when they heard shots – perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas.another protest march, near rio’s maracana stadium, also had a heavy police response.president dilma rousseff “believes peaceful protests are correct and proper for a democracy and that it is natural for young people to demonstrate.”but people booed the president at the opening ceremony for the confederations cup. she will have serious political problems, both now and in 2014, when brazil will host the world cup and also have an election.nannannannan
advanced	when the taliban sent a gunman to shoot malala yousafzai in october 2012 as she rode home on a bus after school, they made clear their intention: to silence the teenager and kill off her campaign for girls’ education.nine months and countless surgical operations later, she stood up at the united nations on her 16th birthday on friday to deliver a defiant riposte. “they thought that the bullet would silence us. but they failed,” she said.as 16th birthdays go, it was among the more unusual. instead of blowing out candles on a cake, malala sat in one of the main council chambers at the united nations in the central seat usually reserved for world leaders.she listened quietly as ban ki-moon, the un secretary-general, described her as “our hero, our champion”; and as the former british prime minister and now un education envoy, gordon brown, uttered what he called “the words the taliban never wanted her to hear: happy 16th birthday, malala”.the event, dubbed malala day, was the culmination of an extraordinary four years for the girl from mingora, in the troubled swat valley of pakistan. she was thrust into the public glare after she wrote a blog for the bbc urdu service describing her experiences struggling to get an education under the rising power of taliban militants.by 11, she was showing exceptional determination, calling personally on the us special representative to pakistan, richard holbrooke, to use his influence to combat the taliban’s drive against education for girls. by 14, she was on the radar of archbishop desmond tutu, who put her forward for the international children’s peace prize, and, by 15, she became the youngest nobel peace prize nominee in history.but such dizzying global attention came at a price. death threats followed her growing recognition, and, on 9 october 2012, following a meeting of pakistani taliban leaders, the gunman was dispatched to remove what they called the “symbol of infidels and obscenity”.multiple operations in pakistan and the uk followed the attack on the bus, including the fitting of a titanium plate on her left forehead and a cochlear implant to restore her hearing. she now lives with her family in birmingham and does what the taliban tried to stop her doing: goes to school every day. “i am not against anyone,” she said in the un chamber, having taken this day out from the classroom. “neither am i here to speak in terms of personal revenge against the taliban or any other terrorist group.”malala responded to the violence of the taliban with her own countervailing force: words against bullets. “i do not even hate the talib who shot me. even if there is a gun in my hand and he stands in front of me, i would not shoot him.”she spoke confidently, with only an injured eye and a slightly drooping left side of her face to hint at such fresh traumas. there was one other unstated allusion to the horror of her past: she wore a white shawl belonging to a woman who was also targeted by extremists but who, unlike malala, did not survive to tell the tale: benazir bhutto, the former prime minister of pakistan.“the extremists are afraid of books and pens,” the teenager continued. “the power of education frightens them. they are afraid of women. the power of the voice of women frightens them.”she cited the attack in june on a hospital in quetta, capital of baluchistan, and killings of female teachers in khyber pakhtunkhwa. “that is why they are blasting schools every day – because they were and they are afraid of change, afraid of the equality that we will bring to our society.”and she gave her own opposing interpretation of islam to the taliban’s. “they think that god is a tiny, little conservative being who would send girls to hell just because of going to school. the terrorists are misusing the name of islam and pashtun society for their own personal benefits. islam is a religion of peace, humanity and brotherhood. islam says that it is not only each child’s right to get education, rather it is their duty and responsibility.”such ability to articulate what normally remains unarticulated – to give voice to young people normally silenced – has generated its own response. the “stand with malala” petition, calling for education for the 57 million children around the world who do not go to school, has attracted more than four million signatures – more than a million having been added shortly after malala’s speech.at the start of her speech, malala said: “i don’t know where to begin my speech. i don’t know what people would be expecting me to say.” she need not have worried.
advanced	a degree in spanish got me my fi rst job as a journalist, with an international press agency in mexico city, but it didn’t prevent me blundering badly as a rookie reporter.i had just arrived in the mexican capital after a greyhound bus journey all the way from new york and the job interview was a test of my language skills. in my new role, day shifts were spent on the streets in political rallies and nights were spent alone in the offi ce, coordinating the coverage from strifetorn el salvador, nicaragua, guatemala and the rest of central america. but, i also had to report on occasional disasters: fi res, floods and explosions at firework factories.it was as a reporter that i soon found out that i was as bad at understanding numbers in spanish as i was at calculating them in english. phone calls meant for the police got mexican grandmothers out of bed at 2am because i had misunderstood a number and dialled a dodgy digit. even worse, victims were piled too high in my stories – almost 83 dead in a fi re at 6pm turned out to be as few as 38 by 7pm; 12 people injured in a coach crash soon became two and so it went on. finally, i got a call from the main offi ce in washington. “i don’t know what training you have had,” an editor yelled, “but has no one ever told you a death toll can’t go down?!”why are numbers in another language such a conundrum? it may have to do with different numbering systems. if we consider that, in german, for example, which belongs to the same indo-european language family as english, 2.30pm becomes halb drei (half of three) and 21 becomes einundzwanzig (one and twenty), clearly different numeral systems can cause confusion and that’s without even considering indigenous languages with numeral systems so rare they are in danger of dying out.some experts believe there is a link between dyscalculia – the diffi culty in comprehending arithmetic – and problems learning foreign languages, particularly if languages are learnt by rote, since this involves the sequential processes that students with dyscalculia struggle with. but, some students who struggle to learn languages with a grammar textbook may thrive in a foreign-language setting, where learning is more natural and less reliant on sequences of adjectives, prepositions and so on. in my case, i have always found languages easy enough, apart from the numbers.but, perhaps it’s also because numbers in a non-native language are often heard out of context or in isolation, when the listener might have switched off from the foreign language and be unable to suddenly tune in. a straw poll of multilingual friends found that many can be fl orid in french or italian when ordering from a restaurant menu, for example, but freeze if they have to relay numbers, especially over the phone. numbers seem to be taxing, but no one could really say why.in my case, being numerically challenged in a foreign tongue followed me from mexico to other countries and from spanish to german and portuguese. but, in that fi rst journalism job, getting the numbers wrong didn’t always add up to failure.one night, a mexican colleague learnt that the american consul in the port city of veracruz was being held hostage at gunpoint in his offi ce. with no senior english-speaking reporter in the offi ce, it was left to me to try to reach the consulate by phone. having got the number wrong, i was put through to an extension elsewhere in the building and the identity of the person who took my call was unmistakable: i chatted for 15 minutes to the gunman. i may not have persuaded him to put away his gun – but my reputation as a rookie reporter still rose overnight.
advanced	nobody knows which came first: the economic crisis tearing greece apart or shisha, the drug now known as the “cocaine of the poor”. what everyone does accept is that shisha is a killer; and at €2 or less a hit, it is one that has come to stalk greece, the country long on the frontline of europe’s financial meltdown.“as drugs go, it is the worst. it burns your insides, it makes you aggressive and ensures that you go totally mad,” said maria, a former heroin addict. “but it is cheap and it is easy to get, and it is what everyone is doing.”this drug crisis has put athens’s health authorities, already overwhelmed by draconian cuts, under further strain.the drug of preference for thousands of homeless greeks forced on to the streets by poverty and despair, shisha is described by both addicts and officials as a variant of crystal meth, whose potential to send users into a state of mindless violence is underpinned by the substances with which the synthetic drug is frequently mixed: battery acid, engine oil and even shampoo.worse still, it is not only readily available but easy to make – tailor-made for a society that sees little light at the end of the tunnel.“it is a killer, but it also makes you want to kill,” said konstantinos, a drug addict. “you can kill without understanding that you have done it. and it is spreading faster than death. a lot of users have died.”for charalampos poulopoulos, the head of kethea, greece’s pre-eminent anti-drug centre, shisha symbolizes the depredations of a crisis that has led to record levels of destitution and unemployment. it is, he said, an “austerity drug” – the response of dealers who have become ever more adept at producing synthetic drugs designed for those who can no longer afford more expensive highs from such drugs as heroin and cocaine.“the crisis has given dealers the possibility to promote a new, cheap drug, a cocaine for the poor,” said poulopoulos at a centre run for addicts in exarcheia, the anarchist stronghold in athens. “shisha can be sniffed or injected and it can be made in home laboratories – you don’t need any specialized knowledge. it is extremely dangerous.”across greece, the byproducts of six straight years of recession have been brutal and cruel. depression, along with drug and alcohol abuse, has risen dramatically. delinquency and crime have soared as greek society has unravelled under the weight of austerity measures that have cut the income of ordinary greeks by 40%. prostitution – the easiest way of financing drug addiction – has similarly skyrocketed.“desperation is such that many women agree to engage in unprotected sex because that way they’ll make more money,” said eleni marini, a british-trained psychologist with kethea. “shisha has been linked to a very intense sexual drive but it attacks your ability to think straight and we’re seeing a lot more pregnancies among drug addicts who engage in prostitution.” in 2012, two sex workers gave birth on the streets of athens.at a time when suicides have also shot up and the spread of hiv infections has assumed epidemic proportions, drug addicts (a population believed to be around 25,000 strong) have become increasingly self-destructive. and, experts say, young greeks marginalized by record rates of unemployment – at 64% greece has the highest youth unemployment in the eu – are leading the way.“the crisis has created a widespread sense of pessimism,” said poulopoulos. “for those who might have quit drugs, there is now no incentive. instead, there’s an atmosphere of misery, where people knowing they won’t find work are becoming a lot more self-destructive. in athens, where the economic crisis has hit hardest, shisha is part of that.”greece’s conservative-dominated coalition government has tried to deal with the problem by driving drug users and other homeless people out of the city centre – a series of controversial police operations has swept central streets, clearing crowded doorways and malls.“but with such actions, authorities are only sweeping the problem under the carpet,” said poulopoulos. “what, in reality, they are really doing is marginalizing these people even more by pushing them into the arms of drug dealers who offer them protection.”just when the demand for help has never been greater, state-funded organizations such as kethea have had their budgets slashed by a third at the request of the “troika” – the ec, ecb and imf – keeping the debt-stricken greek economy afloat.since the outbreak of the crisis in 2009, kethea has lost 70 of its 500 staff. the cuts come despite studies showing that, for every euro invested in programmes such as kethea, the state saves about €6 in costs to the criminal justice and healthcare systems. “the cuts we have witnessed are a false economy, a huge mistake,” said poulopoulos.on the streets of athens, the breeding ground of shisha, there is rising fear that austerity not only doesn’t work – it kills.
advanced	in homes and cafes across the country, a cup of tea, baked beans on toast and fish and chips have long played a key role in the british dining experience. but, the extent of a change in tastes over the generations has been captured in a dataset published recently in the national food survey, which was set up in 1940 by the government after concerns about health and access to food.despite the apparent british love of tea, consumption has more than halved since the 1970s, falling from 68g of tea per person per week to only 25g. with a teabag or portion of loose tea weighing around 3g, that means britons are drinking on average only eight cups of tea a week today, down from 23 cups in 1974. and, while tea remains the most drunk hot drink in the uk, households now spend more on coffee.the data, published by the department for environment, food and rural affairs as part of its “open data” scheme, is from 150,000 households who took part in the survey between 1974 and 2000, combined with information from 2000 to 2014. it shows some moves towards healthier diets in recent decades, with shifts to low-calorie soft drinks, from whole to skimmed milk and increasing consumption of fresh fruit. but, weekly consumption of chips, pizza, crisps and ready meals has soared.there has also been a dramatic shift from white to brown, wholemeal and other bread but the figures suggest the amount people are eating has fallen from 25 to 15 slices a week over the past four decades, based on a 40g slice from a medium sliced loaf. the consumption of baked beans in sauce has dropped by a fifth despite a rise in other types of convenience food, particularly italian dishes. adults in the uk now eat an average of 75g of pizza every week compared with none in 1974, while the consumption of pasta has almost tripled over the same period.fresh potatoes are also becoming less essential with a 67% decrease from 1974, when adults ate the equivalent of 188g every day. other vegetables such as cucumbers, courgettes, aubergines and mushrooms have gained space on the table. consumption of takeaway food has almost doubled since 1974, from 80g per person per week to 150g. around 33g of this amount is chips and 56g is meat, with kebabs (10g), chicken (7g), burgers (5g) and “meat-based meals” (32g) particularly popular.some trends suggest that british people are becoming more prudent in what they put on their plates, with the average consumption of fruit, both fresh and processed, increasing by 50% since 1974. in 2014, uk adults ate an average of 157g of fruit per day, equivalent to almost two portions of the five-a-day recommendation from the government. bananas have been the most popular fruit in the uk since 1996, reaching 221g per adult per week in 2014, well above apples (131g) and oranges (48g). low-calorie soft drinks represented half of all soft drinks consumed in 2014 for the first time.other social changes emerge from the survey, with questions about owning chickens and getting your own eggs being dropped in 1991 and a somewhat belated end in the same year to asking the “housewife” to fill out the questionnaire. britons are spending a smaller proportion of pay on food today – 11%, compared with 24% in 1974.the uk environment secretary, elizabeth truss, said: “food is the heart and soul of our society and this data not only shows what we were eating 40 years ago but how a change in culture has led to a food revolution. shoppers are more plugged in to where their food comes from than ever before, the internet has brought quality produce to our doorsteps at the click of a button, pop-up restaurants are showcasing the latest trends and exciting global cuisines are now as common as fish and chips.”“by opening up this data, we can look beyond what, where or how previous generations were eating and pinpoint the moments that changed our habits for good. we’ve only scraped the surface of what the national food survey can tell us and, from local food maps and school projects to predicting new food trends, i look forward to seeing how this data can be used to learn more about our past and grow our world-leading food and farming industry in the future.”
advanced	the vast fortunes made by the world’s richest 100 billionaires are driving up inequality and hindering the world’s ability to tackle poverty, according to oxfam.the charity said the accumulation of wealth and income on an unprecedented scale, often at the expense of secure jobs and decent wages for the poorest, undermined the ability of people who survive on aid or low wages to improve their situation and escape poverty.oxfam said the world’s poorest could be lifted out of poverty several times over if the richest 100 billionaires would give away the money they made in 2012.without pointing a finger at individuals, the charity argued that the $240bn net income amassed in 2012 by the richest 100 billionaires would be enough to make extreme poverty history four times over.it is rare for charities to attack the wealthy, who are usually regarded as a source of funding. bill gates and warren buffett are among a group of 40 us billionaires who have pledged much of their wealth to aid projects, but there is little detail about the level of their annual donations. their actions have also not been matched by russian, middle eastern or chinese billionaires.in the report, the cost of inequality: how wealth and income extremes hurt us all, published just before the world economic forum in davos, the charity calls on world leaders to curb income extremes and commit to reducing inequality to at least 1990 levels.the report found that the richest 1% had increased their incomes by 60% in the past 20 years, with the financial crisis accelerating rather than slowing the process.barbara stocking, oxfam’s chief executive, said extreme wealth was “economically inefficient, politically corrosive, socially divisive and environmentally destructive”.she said studies show that countries suffer low levels of investment and growth as workers are forced to survive on a smaller share of total incomes.she said: “we can no longer pretend that the creation of wealth for a few will inevitably benefit the many – too often the reverse is true.”the report said the issue affected all parts of the world. “in the uk, inequality is rapidly returning to levels not seen since the time of charles dickens [the nineteenth-century novelist]. in china, the top 10% now take home nearly 60% of the income. chinese inequality levels are now similar to those in south africa, which is now the most unequal country on earth and significantly more unequal than at the end of apartheid.”in the us, the share of national income going to the top 1% has doubled since 1980 from 10 to 20%, the report says. for the top 0.01% the share of national income is above levels last seen in the 1920s.the world bank and international monetary fund have argued that extreme income inequality undermines growth and both organizations have attempted to tie their loans to programmes that limit the growth of inequality.members of the richest 1% are estimated to use as much as 10,000 times more carbon than the average us citizen.oxfam said world leaders should learn from countries such as brazil, which has grown rapidly while reducing inequality.stocking said: “we need a global new deal to reverse decades of increasing inequality. as a first step, world leaders should formally commit themselves to reducing inequality to the levels seen in 1990.”she said closing tax havens, which the tax justice network says hold as much as $31 trillion, or as much as a third of all global wealth, could yield $189bn in additional tax revenues.
advanced	the last time she took to the stage, the prototype of the mobile phone was undergoing its first trials. thirty-five years later, as she performs once again, singer kate bush is faced with a different world.while most concerts are now aglow with phones and tablets, bush is taking a stand against fans watching her shows through the digital veil of a screen.prior to her highly anticipated series of concerts at the hammersmith apollo in london, bush released a statement appealing to her fans to put down their mobile phones at her gigs.bush wrote on her website: “i have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows. we have purposefully chosen an intimate theatre setting rather than a large venue or stadium. it would mean a great deal to me if you would please refrain from taking photos or filming during the shows.“i very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iphones, ipads or cameras. i know it’s a lot to ask but it would allow us to all share in the experience together.”with her love of theatrics and opulent costumes, bush’s keenness to stop fans uploading grainy footage to youtube could also be an attempt to keep the show a surprise for the thousands of fans who have purchased tickets for the 22 dates she is playing.bush is not the first to speak out against the detrimental effect of the presence of phones at concerts, with numerous artists berating their fans for experiencing live music through the filter of a screen.the who front man, roger daltrey, recently said it was “weird” that people did not have their mind on the show when they had gone to a performance and were concentrating on staring at the screen rather than the artist on stage.he said: “i feel sorry for them, i really feel sorry for them. looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally – if you’re doing that, you’re 50% there, right? it’s weird. i find it weird.”in 2013, beyoncé berated one of her fans at a gig for filming. “you can’t even sing because you’re too busy taping,” beyoncé told him. “i’m right in your face, baby. you gotta seize this moment. put that damn camera down!”the debate around the presence of phones at live events is not restricted to music, with sport fans equally vocal on the subject. recently, dutch fans at psv eindhoven launched a vehement protest against the introduction of wi-fi in their stadium, holding up banners with messages like “no wi-fi. support the team,” “you can sit at home,” and “stand united”, while manchester united have also told fans to leave their “large electronic devices” at home, prohibiting filming on tablets this season.jarvis cocker has previously criticized phonewielders in the audience for driving him “insane at concerts”, adding: “it seems stupid to have something happening in front of you and look at it on a screen that’s smaller than the size of a cigarette packet.”johnny marr said in 2013 that it meant that fans missed out on the sensory experience of live music in their desperation to document the event for later“to stand and just be looking at it through your phone is a completely wasted opportunity. you know, i don’t mean to be unkind but i think you should put your phone down because you’re just being an idiot, really. just enjoy the gig,” he said.“that’s one of the things about gigs – it’s taking in what’s going on with the people around you and, watching it on a little screen, it’s a waste of time.”the yeah yeah yeahs resorted to putting up a sign at one of their venues, pleading with fans to pocket their technology. it read: “please do not watch the show through a screen on your smart device/camera. put it away as a courtesy to the person behind you, and to the band.”it has even filtered into the world of classical music, with one of the world’s leading pianists surprising concert-goers in june 2013 when he stormed off stage because a fan was filming his performance on a smartphone. krystian zimerman returned moments later and declared: “the destruction of music because of youtube is enormous.”but sam watt of vyclone, a phone app that encourages audiences to film at concerts and then brings together the footage to create a crowd-sourced video of the event, said that such artists were fighting a losing battle and that filming at concerts enhanced rather than detracted from the experience.“fans filming is now part of the concert experience – that is a just a fact – so we take that footage that people are filming at concerts through the app, they upload it onto the app, and then it comes back to them mixed together with everybody else who was filming. you end up with really fantastic content,” he said.“our overall thinking is that filming at concerts adds to the experience, rather than taking away from it and i think, if kate bush came round for a cup of tea, we could have a really interesting discussion about this and we might be able to win her round,” he added. “knowing that people are going to film and want those memories is really important because it is probably going to hit them on the head in the future if they say to everyone they can’t film. you’ve got to embrace it.”
advanced	the beginning of the year is probably prime-time for feeling glum about work: it’s ages until the next holiday, and it’s dark in the morning and when you get home. and, if you’re stuck in a job you don’t like, it could be enough to have you reaching for your cv. but, before you start hunting through the job ads, try to put things in perspective. so, what else could you be doing instead? we asked fi ve people doing some unusual jobs how much they are paid, what the worst parts are and why they enjoy their work.1. dog-food taster the job: tasting dog food to make sure it meets a premium brand’s quality standardswhat it involves: opening sample tins of each freshly made batch of dog (or cat) food, smelling it and eating it. “although dogs’ palates are different from ours, taste is an important quality check to ensure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced in just the right way,” says philip wells, the chief taster for lily’s kitchen pet food. “trying the food is also a good way to pick up on the nuances of the cooking; this works especially well on the dry food.”typical salary: £20,000 for an entry-level job in the quality department. however, wells says £50,000 or more is “easily achievable” for an experienced technical director who, as well as tasting products, is also likely to be responsible for developing new recipes and advising the business on technical and regulatory matters.worst part of the job: the deadlines, for wells, who admits he quite likes the food. the meat used in pet food has to be derived from animals passed as fi t for human consumption, under the animal feed regulations 2010, and he says the fi rm uses “human-grade freshly prepared raw food” in its recipes. he adds: “there are some pretty gruesome pet foods out there and, although i don’t taste them, the smell is enough to turn the stomach when i do a bit of market research.”job satisfaction: “no two days are ever the same.” it’s rewarding, wells says, that a project he has worked on will “help pets to become happier and healthier”. however, he acknowledges that some of the credit must go to another “key member” of the tasting team: lily, the border terrier.2. hygiene technician the job: disinfecting areas that have potentially been exposed to bio-hazardous situationswhat it involves: cleaning up crime scenes, road accidents and suicides. clearing hoarders’ houses full of rubbish, rats and excrement … among other things. “the job is about keeping people safe,” says richard lewis, a hygiene technician for rentokil. “we deal with some very disturbingly dirty sites.”typical salary: the entry-level salary is usually around £14,500 and a top salary can be up to £22,000.worst part of the job: cleaning up after suicides. “you get used to the job being disgusting but the emotional side of it is still hard.” you learn not to take your work home with you, he says. “you also need to have a sense of humour, as some days can be tough.”job satisfaction: lewis fi nds the variety of tasks exciting. “one day, i’m cleaning up after a dead body; another day, i’m in a prison cell or 100 feet in the air being lowered down into a silo to clean it.” he also takes pride in the transformation he brings about: “it’s satisfying to return a potentially hazardous site back to a safe environment. and it benefi ts society.”3. biogas engineer the job: setting up biogas plants in developing countrieswhat it involves: linking a system of digesters – which can be fi lled with human excrement, animal dung and other waste products – to toilets to produce a biogas that can be used for cooking and lighting. “you have to know what size and shape the mixing pit needs to be, how to create the optimum temperature for digestion and where to situate the biogas plant,” says baburam paudel, chief technical offi cer in nepal for the charity renewable world. “you also have to convince poor communities that poo can be productive – many are repelled by the idea of connecting their toilets to their kitchens.”typical salary: an entry-level salary is around £10,000, while a typical salary for a chief technical offi cer is £30,000.worst part of the job: for paudel, it’s seeing people struggling to survive on very little income. but, he admits, anyone who won’t change a nappy would struggle. “you have to be willing to get your hands dirty during the build process and inspections. unsurprisingly, the anaerobic digestion (the process that takes place when bacteria eat the decomposing waste and produce methane) smells like rotten eggs. it can be disgusting and there is no room for mistakes.”job satisfaction: “i fi nd it immensely satisfying to know that i am helping people to increase their incomes and allowing girls to attend school by replacing the need to collect fi rewood,” says paudel. “my work improves the health and hygiene of whole communities.”4. eel ecologist the job: conserving the critically endangered european eelwhat it involves: to monitor the size of the endangered eels, ecologists wade into the thames and other london rivers and marshes full of eels, sometimes up to their armpits, and reach into a net fi lled with up to 20 adult eels to grab one with their bare hands. “adult eels can be a metre long, or even larger, and weigh up to 2kg. they’re not at all dangerous but they are almost pure muscle and they can be a little bit slimy,” says stephen mowat, an eel conservationist and ecologist for the zoological society of london. “we have to weigh and measure them, and they wriggle … a lot. it’s diffi cult to look professional while crawling on the ground chasing an eel across the grass.”worst part of the job: “eels are really tricky creatures to work with – and getting outsmarted by an eel can be quite embarrassing,” says mowat. “you also have to be ready to jump from one project to the next. i once had to dissect a tub of dead eels to examine parasites living in them, moments before jumping into a suit for a meeting with government offi cials. i remembered to wash my hands.” but, for mowat, the worst part of the job is defi nitely not handling the eels – he believes baby eels (known as elvers) are “as cute as pandas”: “the worst thing about the job is regularly learning how much damage we, the british population, are doing to the environment.”job satisfaction: “getting to work outdoors and seeing british wildlife up close is the best part of the job,” says mowat. “eels are beautiful creatures and working with eels doesn’t just benefi t the eel: it helps whole river systems, estuaries and coastal habitats. that is something worth working on.”5. shopping channel presenter the job: selling and demonstrating a wide range of products on live tvwhat it involves: presenting hours and hours of monotonous content, while simultaneously demonstrating the products and appearing to be enthusiastic and knowledgeable about everything that you’re selling. “i prepare and research as much technical and practical information as possible on every single product beforehand,” says shaun ryan, presenter for ideal world tv. “but you also need the ability to relate to every genre of products and to every viewer.”typical salary: a trainee presenter would start on a minimum of £30,000, while an experienced presenter can expect over £55,000.worst part of the job: “the unsociable hours,” says ryan. “an experienced presenter like myself generally gets to work prime-time hours, which means all weekends, bank holidays and very late evenings, plus the occasional 5am shift.” his worst task ever, he says, was singlehandedly having to sell some female slimming pants: “it was a very tricky hour and not my fi nest.”job satisfaction: “i love the rush of live presenting and having to think on my feet every second,” says ryan. “i also get an adrenaline rush from knowing that, at times, i have thousands of viewers ordering the product that i have just been presenting.”
advanced	coal is likely to rival oil as the world’s biggest source of energy in the next five years, with potentially disastrous consequences for the climate, according to the world’s leading authority on energy economics.one of the biggest factors behind the rise in coal use has been the massive increase in the use of shale gas in the us.new research from the international energy agency (iea) shows that coal consumption is increasing all over the world – even in countries and regions with carbon-cutting targets – except in the us, where shale gas has displaced coal. the decline of coal consumption in the us has helped to cut prices for coal globally. this has made it more attractive, even in europe where coal use was supposed to be discouraged by the emissions trading scheme.maria van der hoeven, executive director of the iea, said: “coal’s share of the global energy mix continues to grow each year and, if no changes are made to current policies, coal will catch oil within a decade.”coal is abundant and found in most regions of the world, unlike conventional oil and gas, and can be cheaply extracted. as a result, coal was used to meet nearly half of the rise in demand for energy globally in the past decade. according to the iea, demand from china and india will drive world coal use in the coming five years, with india likely to overtake the us as the world’s second biggest consumer. china is the biggest coal importer, and indonesia the biggest exporter, having temporarily overtaken australia.according to the iea’s medium-term coal market report the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today – the equivalent of the current coal consumption of russia and the us combined. global coal consumption is forecast to reach 4.3bn tonnes of oil equivalent by 2017, while oil consumption is forecast to reach 4.4bn tonnes by the same date.with the highest carbon emissions of any major fossil fuel, coal is a huge contributor to climate change, particularly when burned in old-fashioned, inefficient power stations. when these are not equipped with special “scrubbing” equipment to remove chemicals, coal can also produce sulphur emissions – the leading cause of acid rain – and other pollutants such as mercury and soot particles.van der hoeven said that, without a high carbon price to discourage the growth in coal use and encourage cleaner technologies such as renewable power generation, only competition from lower-priced gas could realistically cut demand for coal. this has happened in the us, owing to the extraordinary increase in the production of shale gas in that market in the past five years.she said: “the us experience suggests that a more efficient gas market, marked by flexible pricing and fuelled by indigenous unconventional resources that are produced sustainably, can reduce coal use, carbon dioxide emissions and consumers’ electricity bills. europe, china and other regions should take note.”that would mean producing much more shale gas, as conventional gas resources are running down in their easily accessible locations.in europe, the emissions trading scheme was supposed to discourage high-carbon power generation by imposing a price on carbon dioxide emissions. this was done through issuing generators and energy-intensive companies with a set quota of emissions permits, requiring them to buy extra permits if they needed to emit more than their allowance. but an over-allocation, coupled with the effects of the financial crisis and recession, has led to a large surplus of permits on the market, which has in turn led to a plunge in permit prices. at current levels – a few euros per tonne of carbon – there is little incentive to seek out lower carbon fuels, and coal is enjoying a renaissance in europe.that means one of the world’s only regulatory market mechanisms aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions is failing in its key goals. the world faces the likelihood of an increased risk of climate change as a result of this runaway consumption of the highest carbon fossil fuel.
advanced	sleep deprivation used to be a badge of honour: a sign you were busy and important and very much in demand. snoozing was losing and sleep was for wimps. now, however, arianna huffington’s the sleep revolution, a ‘call to bed’ that promises to transform your life “one night at a time”, is a new york times best-seller and huffington is urging people to “sleep their way to the top”.meanwhile, the sleep industry has woken up big time and a whole range of start-ups are reinventing where, when and how we sleep, as well as how much we’re prepared to pay for it. for the more upmarket snoozer, luxury hotels are offering “sleep retreats”; more than $1,000 gets you dinner and a movie about sleep. and, if you’re staying home, you can upgrade your bedroom with everything from a mattress cover with a sensor that tracks your sleep ($249) to a brainwave-monitoring sleeping mask that lets you nap more efficiently ($299).sleep hasn’t just been corporatized – it has infiltrated corporations. a number of companies already have nap pods and huffington predicts that nap rooms in offices are going to become “as common as conference rooms” in the next two years. so, how did this happen? how did sleep, something humans have done since long before huffington awoke to it, suddenly become so fashionable?getting enough sleep is a natural fit for the sort of lifestyle in which paying $10 for green juice and $34 for a soulcycle class is the norm. then, there’s the rise of the quantified self through wearable technology. our bodies have become input/output devices that we monitor and optimize for greater efficiency and sleep has become another data set to be tracked. what huffington emphasizes about sleep, after all, is not that it rests you but that it restores you. sleep, she says, is the ultimate performance enhancer and getting eight hours of rest has become the ultimate status symbol.you know how arianna huffington gets her eight hours? well, for one thing, she has “nine or so” assistants, according to a recent new york times profile. huffington calls them her “a-team”; they do everything from running her errands to planning her travel to loading the huffington post on her computer in the morning. according to the times, most of the a-team can only endure about 12 months of the work because it’s so taxing. the low pay also means many of them take second jobs. basically, they don’t sleep so that huffington can … and can sell books about it.getting enough sleep isn’t just a question of valuing sleep enough to go to bed at the right time; it’s a question of going to bed in the right neighbourhood and in the right body. numerous studies show that you’re more likely to sleep poorly if you’re poor. it’s hard to sleep if you’re worried about your safety or haven’t had enough to eat. it’s hard to sleep if you’re one of the 15 million american shift workers who work irregular hours. research has also found that there’s a black/white sleep gap. one study shows that, while white people sleep an average of 6.85 hours, african americans sleep an average of 6.05 hours. they also have a lower quality of sleep. researchers have attributed this, in part, to the stress of discrimination.want to know who gets the most sleep and the best quality of sleep in america? wealthy white women. which, if i’d hazard a guess, is probably the same demographic huffington is targeting her book at. huffington describes her promotion of sleep as a “revolution” but, really, it’s a rebranding. the very real sleep crisis we face isn’t down to a few rich people thinking it’s a waste of time; it’s down to the 99% not being able to afford to spend time sleeping.while sleep is currently enjoying a moment, it will probably be short-lived. sleep may be a performance enhancer but it’s an inefficient one. the real prize is finding a way to negate sleep deprivation so humans can function on less sleep. unsurprisingly, the military is at the forefront of this research. in 2008, the pentagon published a report called “human performance” which examined the possibility of a future in which soldiers could perform at their peak with only a couple of hours’ sleep. “suppose a human could be engineered who slept for the same amount of time as a giraffe (1.9 hours per night). this would lead to an approximately twofold decrease in the casualty rate. an adversary would need an approximately 40% increase in the troop level to compensate for this advantage.” the report goes on to look at the effects of ampakines, a class of drugs that modulate neurotransmitters in the brain, to remove the effects of sleep deprivation.eventually, humans will figure out a way to get rid of sleep. spending a third of your life unconscious won’t be a luxury anymore; it’ll be something only the poor will be forced to do. at which point, we may need a whole new sort of sleep revolution.
advanced	the controversial auction of a banksy mural that disappeared from the wall of a north london shop in mysterious circumstances was dramatically halted just moments before it was due to go under the hammer.slave labour, a spray-painted artwork depicting a child making union flag bunting and seen as a critical social commentary on last year’s diamond jubilee, was expected to sell for about $700,000 in a sale of street and contemporary art in florida.but auctioneer frederic thut, the owner of the fine arts auction miami art house, who had refused all week to divulge the identity of the seller or how it came to be listed for sale through his gallery, announced that the piece, along with a second work by the secretive british street artist, had been withdrawn.he would not give a reason, but community leaders in haringey, who led a vocal campaign to stop the sale of the artwork that was prised from the wall of a poundland in wood green, were jubilant.“one of our two demands was that it doesn’t sell and the other was that we get it back again, so we’re halfway there,” said alan strickland, a haringey councillor.“i will be writing to the auction house as a matter of urgency to clarify what happened and what will happen next, but for now we are really pleased that because of the pressure and the strong views of the people of wood green, a community campaign in london has had an impact in the us. it’s a real victory for the people.”claire kober, leader of haringey council, wrote to arts council england and the mayor of miami, tomás regalado, to ask them to intervene to stop the sale but it appears the decision to withdraw the item came from the gallery owners in consultation with their lawyers. the fbi refused to confirm reports they were asked to investigate.several hours after the conclusion of the auction, the auction house issued a brief statement claiming it had persuaded the owners of the two banksys to pull them from the sale. “although there are no legal issues whatsoever regarding the sale of lots six and seven by banksy, faam convinced its sellers to withdraw these lots from the auction.”about 30 potential buyers attended the sale of 106 lots listed in the catalogue for the modern, contemporary and street art sale in miami’s trendy wynwood neighbourhood. the three-hour auction continued with other early lots selling in excess of their asking prices.critics have accused the auction house of dealing in stolen property but thut insisted earlier in the week that the seller, who he described as a “well known collector”, was the rightful owner and that the sale was legal.he added that his gallery had been inundated with emails and phone calls from the uk, saying that many of them were abusive or offensive, but said he supported the inclusion of the pieces in the sale because it would preserve them.the second banksy due to be auctioned, a 2007 artwork entitled wet dog that was removed from a bethlehem wall and is estimated to be worth up to $800,000, disappeared from the auction house’s online catalogue at lunchtime on saturday, but slave labour was still listed for sale right up to the 3pm start time.thut said the two pieces, supplied to him by separate owners, neither of them british, were important works in the street art scene and deserved buyers “whose first interest is in art and its preservation”.he said he would maintain the privacy of the collector who put it up for sale. “we respect our clients and their confidentiality. it’s not our decision to have [the banksy] returned. we only sell it. we do not have control of it.”a spokesperson for poundland said it had no idea who removed the 4ft x 5ft slab from the side of the shop it rents in turnpike lane. lawyers for the owner of the building, a company called wood green investments ltd, have refused to confirm if it had anything to do with the episode.banksy himself has not commented on the slave labour furore, but has previously condemned those who have tried to sell his artwork, speaking out before the proposed sale of five of his pieces at a 2011 auction in new york. none found a buyer.stephan keszler, the dealer behind that auction, believes selling banksy’s works without his permission is legitimate.“he does something on other people’s property without asking. the owner of the property can do whatever they want with it,” keszler said.
