intermediate	as soon as the children at one primary school in stirling, scotland, hear the words òdaily mileó, they put down their pencils and leave the classroom to start running around the school  eld. for three-and-a-half years, all the pupils at st ninianõs primary school have walked or run a mile each day. they do it at different times during the day and, despite the rise in childhood obesity across the uk, none of the children at the school are overweight.the daily mile has done so much to improve these childrenõs  tness, behaviour and concentration in lessons that many other british schools are doing the same. they are getting pupils to get up from their desks and take 15 minutes to walk or run round the school or local park.elaine wyllie, headteacher of st ninianõs, said: òi get at least two emails a day from other schools and local authorities asking how we do it. the thought of children across the country running every day because of something weõve done is phenomenal.one in ten children are obese when they start school at the age of four or  ve, according to the health & social care information centre, and, in the summer of 2015, a study found that schoolchildren in england are the least  t they have ever been. primary schools therefore accept the bene ts of the daily mile. it has been introduced in schools in various parts of the uk and other schools are planning to launch the initiative during the 2015-16 academic year. in stirling alone, 30 schools have already started or will soon start the daily mile.òitõs a common-sense approach to childrenõs  tness, which is free and easy. the most important thing is that the children really enjoy it; otherwise, you couldnõt sustain it. they come back inside bright-eyed and rosy-cheeked, how children used to look,ó said wyllie. at st ninianõs, teachers take their pupils out of lessons to a specially built circuit around the schoolõs playing  eld for their daily mile whenever it best suits that dayõs timetable. only ice or very heavy rain stop them.the extent of the bene ts isnõt known yet but researchers from stirling university have launched a comparative study to look for evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile. dr colin moran, who is leading the study, said: òthe children donõt seem to have problems with obesity; they seem happier and staff say they settle into lessons faster so we designed a study that would test all of these things.ó st ninianõs pupils will be compared with children from another school in stirling that hasnõt yet started the scheme.kevin clelland, a primary school teacher from leeds, visited st ninianõs and, then, convinced his colleagues it was a great idea. he said: òitõs such a simple thing to do but seems to have such an amazing impact. weõre really committed to improving the  tness of our pupils.ó his school is now building a track.active cheshire, a sports and  tness organization in cheshire, is taking a group of senior people from the local authority up to scotland to assess the results of the daily mile. the hope is to introduce it across the 450 schools in their region if a pilot programme is successful.paralympian, tanni grey-thompson, chair of ukactive, a health organization for physical activity, said: òall children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day, whether in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground. itõs fantastic to see initiatives like the daily mile, showing real leadership from the education sector to improve childrenõs  tness levels and their cognitive behaviour, and make a real difference to schools, teachers, parents and young peopleõs lives. we know sitting still kills; not sitting still helps children build skills that will stay with them for life.óthe scottish government also supports the initiative. a spokesperson said: òlearning in pe is enhanced by initiatives like the daily mile, which can encourage and support parents in fostering healthy habits with their children from a young age. we are pleased to see so many scottish schools are taking part or planning to do so.ó
intermediate	the problem with google glasses, says takahito iguchi, is that they’re not cool. he may be right. there’s already a website dedicated to people wearing them looking either ridiculous or smug or, more often, both. search google images and one of the first hits is a picture of a large, naked man wearing them in the shower. and it’s this that iguchi, a japanese entrepreneur, hopes may be google’s achilles’ heel. he is launching a competitor that is a bit more stylish. a bit more blade runner. a bit more japanese.iguchi’s augmented reality glasses aren’t really glasses – they are more a single piece of metal with a camera and a tiny projector. they are called telepathy one and, since they were presented to the public for the first time in austin, texas, they have attracted $5m of venture capital. like glass, telepathy one is due to launch in 2014.it’s a simplified version of google glass. glass has a range of uses – you can surf the internet, read emails, take photographs – but telepathy will be “more of a communication device”. connected via bluetooth to your phone, it will focus on real-time visual and audio sharing. you’ll be able to post photos and videos from your line of vision on facebook or send them as an email, or see and speak to a video image of a friend.“it will help bring you close to your friends and family. we are very focused on the communication and sharing possibilities,” says iguchi, who has worked in the japanese technology industry for 20 years.of course, not everyone wants to get closer to the man in the futuristic headset, i tell him. iguchi shakes his head. “i’m a visionary. i have a dream that people will understand other people. when i go to london, i am a stranger. sometimes i feel fear. but i believe that everyone wants to be understood and to understand each other. and, with this device, you can know more information about people before you even speak to them.”compared to google, telepathy is a minnow, but iguchi doesn’t seem to worry. in his shared office space in san francisco – a cool, converted warehouse – he quotes sun tzu’s the art of war and says that even tiny armies can sometimes beat powerful forces. when he was growing up, japanese technology ruled the world: the sony walkman was the iphone of its day. now, to compete, he’s had to leave tokyo and go to silicon valley.“tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture but it’s still an island. it’s isolated. there is not any way to expand. whereas, in silicon valley, everyone is from everywhere. it’s where you come to connect globally.” the hardware will be made in japan, and he is putting together a team of software engineers in the us to develop its applications.building the prototype of telepathy one was easy, iguchi says. “we have every sort of technology in tokyo. it is presenting it to the world that is the challenge.” the top manufacturers all want to work with him, he says, because they have the technology, they just struggle to sell it. “there needs to be a story to the product. like apple did with the ipod – 1,000 songs in your pocket. and steve jobs was inspired by akio morita, the co-founder of sony, and he inspired me, so maybe it will come in a circle.”maybe. he certainly has the confidence of jobs, but, with a thick japanese accent, he sometimes struggles to make himself understood, a fact that may have contributed to his idea for telepathy one. when he went to london to present the headset, he stayed in an airbnb. “the house owner was not my friend but i talked with him for three hours, and now he is my friend. that is how long it takes to understand each other, to share our feelings, and background, and career. maybe telepathy makes that quicker. if you are getting info from the cloud and social networks, that will happen more easily.”iguchi hopes that seeing somebody else’s i suddenly realized that everything is code. everything is coded and is shareable between humans. and everything can be encoded and decoded. and, if code is exchangeable between humans, that will end all war.” literal point of view will help you to see their metaphorical point of view. as a student, he explains, he studied philosophy by day and taught himself how to code by night. “and, one day, i opened the door of my apartment and
intermediate	it is no longer legal to smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the worldõs drinking capital, new orleans, louisiana. many other cities have banned indoor smoking but new orleans is different ð it attracts tourists with a òlet the good times rolló attitude. an indoor smoking ban in new orleans could have unique consequences.since hurricane katrina in 2005, new orleans city government has begun trying to turn down the volume a bit. with the support of neighbourhood groups, the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly, while, at the same time,  ghting to implement a new ònoise ordinanceó.òthis is just the wrong time for something like this,ó complains bar-owner william walker, who hates the anti-smoking law. òforcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to increase the tension thatõs already there.ómany of new orleansõs best bars and live music venues are in quiet residential neighbourhoods. this neighbourly coexistence is a big part of what makes new orleans different and charming. but, recently, this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of new orleansõs musical personality feels at risk.martha wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music. òi bought the house partly because of the bar so i wonõt ever complain about the noise,ó says wood, who also manages a live-music bar. this bar became one of new orleansõs  rst ever bars legally banned from serving drinks to go, after a series of noise issues in 2013 ð including complaints about the loud smokers outside.the maple leaf club went smoke-free voluntarily in 2014. the same happened at another club where artists had been demanding smoke-free nights. òa lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so i wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesnõt host music,ó says zalia beville, manager of the all ways lounge.luckily, all ways has an outdoor patio, unlike lost love lounge, whose owner, geoff douville, loves the ban ð heõd previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar going. òthereõs no way i could have banned smoking in my bar without a ban throughout the whole city,ó says douville. òpeople act like i have that choice, as a business owner. but, if i make that rule, customers walk down the block to a bar with smoking.ómany small business owners also fear smoke- free revenue loss. smoker neil timms owns an english pub and met the smoking ban before, in england. òback home in england, every pub i knew closed within a year of the smoking ban,ó remembers timms of the ukõs ban, begun in 2007. he doesnõt want his pub to close so heõs spending money to build a patio.but douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity. òthere are lots of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar, with our food, but would never come because they didnõt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days ð weõre now an option for all those people.ó nor does douville worry about noise complaints: òno court is going to say a bar is a ônuisanceõ after the city has rati ed a smoking ban that requires you to go outside!ó he says.councilwoman latoya cantrell, who introduced the ban, disagrees: òthe responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their customers respectful outside as well,ó she says. òthe owners and bartenders need to tell them to go and have a smoke but be respectful to their communities. the idea that we canõt have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous. we can have clean air without noise problems ð i think itõs about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.ócantrell recognizes that the city is different. òhow is new orleans different from the rest of the country? new orleans is known as a place where you can relax and have fun,ó she says. ònew orleans needs to stand up and say ôwe care about our people.õ the most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions are the backbone of our hospitality industry, which drives the economy in the state of louisiana.ómany were worried that the police would not have time to enforce the ban. so the health department   will handle bar warnings and  nes. bar customers are encouraged to ò ll out a form or call 311 and to include photographs of illegal smokingó. for this reason alone, neil timms says heõll comply with the ban: òi donõt want someone to be sitting in the corner smoking and someone takes a photo and gets beaten up.óunworried, geoff douville says that heõs used to noise complaints by now. òyou will see: the nosy neighbours who complain about the noise now are going to be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban.ó in the end, douville shares cantrellõs optimism. òof course theyõre going to complain,ó he accepts. òbut it doesnõt mean theyõre going to win.ó
intermediate	brazil’s latest funk sensation, anitta, has won millions of fans by making the favela sound popular, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour.anti-discrimination campaigners and social commentators say the music industry’s fastest rising star has had to give up her blackness to be a success in the predominantly white middle-class market.the controversy began with the publication of then-and-now photographs that show a dramatic lightening of anitta’s skin tone since she signed a deal with warner.in the first photo, when she was quite unknown, she looked darker. in the second – a marketing photo after she became famous – she seems lighter. the contrast has restarted discussion about whether you need to have light skin to get ahead in brazil.jarid arraes, a psychology student and blogger, wrote a post criticizing the discrimination in media and marketing that she felt anitta’s image change represented. “people refuse to accept that they are racist and they think they live in a multiracial democracy, but the statistics show that is far from the case. white is the image of the rich, the nice, the successful, the good, while people see black as the opposite of all that.”born larissa de macedo machado, the diva-to-be was a church chorister in her childhood. in her teens, she made a name for herself in rio de janeiro’s baile funk scene as a dancer and singer.she now has an album and a huge hit single, show das poderosas, which topped the charts and attracted 52 million youtube views.many people love her because she is a pop idol with a strong message and some catchy tunes. her marketing team want people to see her as a cultural bridge between the predominantly black and mixed-race shanty towns on rio’s hillsides and the wealthier and whiter communities below.gangsta references and explicit lyrics of baile funk. now, however, questions are being asked about whether she – or her marketing team – have gone too far in changing her. arraes says that if pop stars have curly hair, they will want to straighten it. if they have a big nose, they will want to make it smaller. it creates a vicious cycle for how you feel about yourself.this is a sensitive topic in this largely mixed-raced nation. brazil – one of the last big countries in the world to ban slavery – has the largest population of african descent outside africa, but race and where your family come from are less important there than colour. there is a clear link between skin tone and inequality.in brazilian cities, white workers earn roughly twice as much as those of african descent. up until 2011, black or mixed-race students also spent two years less at school on average.most business and government executives are white, while most menial jobs are done by black and mixed-race workers. if you walk through ipanema, gávea or other rich districts, you are far more likely to see black nannies pushing strollers with white children than a white nanny pushing a black child.defining colour is complex. people who define themselves as white were in the minority for the first time in the most recent census in 2010. among the 197 million population, 82 million said they were “pardu” (mixed race), 15 million black, two million asian and 0.5% indigenous.sylvio ferreira, a psychology lecturer at the federal university of pernambuco, believes anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it more acceptable to everyone.maycon de mattos batista, a financial analyst who worked with anitta while she was an intern, said there had been a huge change in anitta’s image, but not of her colour.“i don’t believe it’s whitening; it’s more the way they are producing her with makeup, hairstylists and the way she dresses,” he said. “i don’t think that was because of pressure they put on her. she always liked to show off, sing and dance. that was a natural thing for her. i believe that it is because of this naturalness that she is where she is today.”nannannannan
intermediate	junior smart knows a lot about gangs. he is now 36 and his life can be divided into two phases. when he was a teenager, after his mother died, he joined a south london gang. at the time, it helped fill a big gap in his life.“they became my new support group,” he says. “at first it was just a bit of fun but then it became more serious, more and more about making money. they got involved in crime. that is how it was.” after leaving college, he got a full-time job in administration and worked as a dj. but, on the side, he was making money illegally as part of the gang.eventually he was arrested for serious drug crimes and was sent to prison for 12 years. “the first night after i was arrested was the biggest wake-up call of my life,” he says. “i had been living a double life. i had been living as one person to my peers and another person to my peers’ enemies. i spent a long time sorting myself out.”today, junior smart runs a team of 12 full-time workers and six volunteers, which aims to turn young criminals and gang members away from crime. most of the team are ex-criminals like smart. a few are still in prison but they are allowed out during the day to help. they work with the police, the probation service and other, voluntary organizations to help people who feel trapped and frightened in the violent criminal gangs of london.for smart, the extraordinary journey from gang member to mentor began when he was in prison. “i was touched by the people who kept coming back in,” he says. “i couldn’t believe that nothing was done about it. i was talking to the prisoners and they knew what changes they needed in their lives, but the problem is that the prison system only deals with the ‘index’ offence.”“one guy had a £300-a-week cocaine habit, which he paid for through burglary. he told me how he would walk into a house, even when he knew people were there. so although he had a drug addiction, that problem was never solved. the thing that shocked me is that it is simply a revolving door.”smart started working as a prison “listener” – a prisoner who helps new arrivals during their first days in prison. then he developed an idea to run his own scheme when he was out of prison – using the experience of ex-offenders to help others reject the revolving door of prison life. he was released early, after five years, and got the opportunity to put his idea into practice.so what does he think now? does he believe that things are getting better? he is careful to say positive things about the police; he says much of their work in arresting gang members has been good. but in general he is highly critical of a disjointed government approach that believes that, once the leader of a gang is arrested, the problem is solved. he agrees with a report that says the arrest of gang leaders can even make things worse. he says the effect of removing the leader is often to destabilize the entire gang.“when you arrest the top guy, everyone starts fighting for position. who was the most loyal? who had the most respect? it is a bit like a family. they are more likely to be violent. it means that the arrest of the gang leaders has been nullified because it has not had a long-term effect.”can it actually make the streets more dangerous? “it can. people take sides. if one gang knows that an elder [leader] has been arrested, then they suddenly think that gang’s weak ... and so there are gang disputes. and what happens when that elder is in prison? he forms alliances with other gang members, or when he is released he then tries to retake control. that is when violence happens.”in order to spread risk down to the lowest levels, he says gangs are now recruiting far more in primary schools. the youngest members are called “tinies”. “over the last years we have seen more and more of this. the tinies can be just eight to eleven years old.” the young protect their seniors from risk. they often do the street dealing or even the stabbing, he says.smart says that the challenges are immense, particularly with the current economic problems. “i try to help a young person who has been earning £300 a week through illegal methods. it was hard before, to try to convince him. but with unemployment high and cuts to benefits, it makes things more difficult.” however, his project, which has over 1,000 clients, is producing results. fewer than 20% of those who come in for help reoffend. smart believes that everyone deserves a second chance.nan
intermediate	illegal downloading is a kind of “moral squalor” and theft, as much as putting your hand in someone’s pocket and stealing their wallet is theft, says author philip pullman. in an article for index on censorship, pullman, who is president of the society of authors, strongly defends copyright laws. he criticizes internet users who think it is ok to download music or books without paying for them.“the technical brilliance is so dazzling that people can’t see the moral squalor of what they’re doing,” he writes. “it is outrageous that anyone can steal an artist’s work and get away with it. it is theft, just as putting your hand in someone’s pocket and taking their wallet is theft.”his article comes after music industry leaders met british prime minister david cameron in downing street to discuss the issue of web piracy.pullman, writer of the his dark materials trilogy, says authors and musicians work in poverty and obscurity for years to bring their work to the level “that gives delight to their audiences and, as soon as they achieve that, the possibility of earning a living from it is taken away from them”. he concludes: “the principle is simple, and unaltered by technology, science or magic: if we want to enjoy the work that someone does, we should pay for it.”pullman is writing in the next issue of the campaign group’s magazine in a dialogue with cathy casserly, chief executive of creative commons, which offers open content licences “that lets creators take copyright into their own hands”. casserly argues that there is a lot wrong with copyright, which was created “in an analogue age”. she writes: “copyright closes the door on the many ways that people can share, build upon and remix each other’s work, possibilities that were unimaginable when those laws were made.” she says artists need to think creatively about how they distribute and earn money from their work, quoting the science fiction writer cory doctorow, who said: “my problem is not piracy, it’s obscurity.”index on censorship agrees. the magazine’s editor, rachael jolley, said: “existing copyright laws don’t work in the digital age and risk criminalizing consumers. we need new models for how artists, writers and musicians earn a living from their work.”the debate is a lively one and the scale of illegal downloading is enormous. data collected by ofcom (the independent regulator and competition authority for the uk communications industries) suggests that between november 2012 and january 2013 in the uk, 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated, along with 52 million tv shows, 29 million films, 18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files.ofcom says 18% of internet users aged over 12 admit that they have recently pirated content, and 9% say they fear getting caught. pullman writes in his article: “the ease and speed with which music can be acquired in the form of mp3 downloads is still astonishing to those of us who have been building up our itunes list for some time.”following the downing street meeting, cameron appointed the conservative mp mike weatherley to be his adviser on the subject. a spokesman for the bpi, the record industry trade body, said: “mike weatherley is a strong champion of copyright and the artists and creative producers it’s there to protect. we hope his influence and the prime minister’s support for copyright will influence the approach of the uk’s intellectual property office.”nan
intermediate	chemists have waited a long time for a new element to turn up and, now, four have been discovered by researchers in japan, russia and the us. the four new elements are the first to be added to the periodic table since 2011, when elements 114 and 116 were included. the new elements, all highly radioactive, complete seventh row of the periodic table and mean that science textbooks around the world are now out of date.the us-based international union of pure and applied chemistry (iupac), the global organization that controls chemical names, terminology and measurement, verified the elements on 30 december, 2015 after examining studies dating back to 2004. the scientists who found them must now come up with formal names to replace the latin-based temporary names – ununtrium, ununpentium, ununseptium and ununoctium – which reflect their atomic numbers, 113, 115, 117, and 118. the atomic number is the number of protons found in an element’s atomic nucleus.iupac announced that a russian-american team of scientists at the joint institute for nuclear research in dubna and lawrence livermore national laboratory in california had produced enough evidence to claim the discovery of elements 115, 117 and 118. the organization gave credit for the discovery of element 113, which had also been claimed by the russians and americans, to a team of scientists from the riken institute in japan. the decision means japan becomes the first asian country to name an element. under iupac rules, new elements can be named after mythological concepts, minerals, a place or country, or a scientist.when elements 114 and 116 were given formal names in 2012, scientists chose flerovium and livermorium respectively, after the flerov lab at dubna’s joint institute of research and the lawrence livermore lab in the us, where the elements were discovered. kosuke morita, who led the research at riken, said his team now planned to “look to the uncharted territory of element 119 and beyond”. jan reedijk of iupac, said: “the chemistry community is eager to see the table finally completed down to the seventh row.”the japanese team is considering three names for ununtrium: japonium, rikenium and nishinarium, after the nishina center for accelerator-based science, where the element was found. “they have been thinking about it for a while already,” said polly arnold, professor of chemistry at edinburgh university. “this is painstaking work. the work helps us with our models and with understanding radioactive decay. if we understand it better, hopefully we can improve how we deal with nuclear waste and things that are important in the real world. it also leads to fantastic technological advances in building the kit to make these observations.”along with new names, the scientists must suggest two-letter symbols for the elements. when iupac has received the researchers’ suggestions, they will go to public review for five months. that allows scientists and others to raise any objections. in 1996, the symbol cp was suggested for copernicium, or element 112, but it was changed to cn when scientists complained that cp referred to another substance.to discover the elements, researchers at the three labs slammed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for radioactive decays that should come from the new elements. ununtrium and ununpentium are thought to be metals. ununseptium could be a metalloid. the fourth element, ununoctium, may be a gas, like other elements, helium, neon and argon. it is hard to know for sure because so few atoms of each element have ever been made.paul karol, chair of the iupac panel that verified the elements, said: “it will be a long time before we can find practical uses for the new elements.”
intermediate	until the end, david bowie, who has died of cancer, was still full of surprises. his latest album, blackstar, appeared on his 69th birthday on 8 january 2016 and proved that he hadn’t lost his gift for making dramatic statements as well as challenging, disturbing music.throughout the 1970s, bowie was a trailblazer of musical trends and pop fashion. he became a singer-songwriter, a pioneer of glam-rock, then got into what he called “plastic soul”, before moving to berlin to create innovative electronic music. his ability to mix brilliant changes of sound and image is unique in pop history.bowie was born david robert jones in south london. in 1953, the family moved to kent, where david showed talent for singing and playing the recorder. later, he studied art, music and design.at 15, david formed his first band, the kon-rads. it was clear that david’s talents and ambition meant that he should go solo. david took the name bowie to avoid confusion with davy jones of the monkees.bowie’s first album, released in june 1967, was titled simply david bowie. in july 1969, bowie released space oddity, the song that would give him his first commercial breakthrough. timed to coincide with the apollo 11 moon landing, it was a top five uk hit.in march 1970, bowie married art student, angela barnett. the man who sold the world was released in the us in late 1970 and in the uk the following year. with its daring songwriting and broody, hard-rock sound, it was the first album to really show his writing and performing gifts. the album’s themes included immortality, insanity, murder and mysticism, which showed that bowie was a songwriter who was thinking outside of pop’s usual boundaries.he followed it with 1972’s hunky dory, a mix of wordy, elaborate songwriting. it was an excellent collection that met with only moderate success but that all changed with the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars later that year.this time, bowie appeared as a science-fiction character – an intergalactic glam-rock star visiting planet earth. the hit single starman brought instant success for the album.everything bowie touched turned to gold. he had his first uk number 1 album with aladdin sane (1973), which included the hit singles the jean genie and drive-in saturday. but bowie was already planning his next career moves.his increasing interest in funk and soul music could be heard on the album young americans (1975), which gave him a us chart-topper with fame (with john lennon as a guest vocalist).with the album station to station (1976), bowie introduced a new persona, the thin white duke. this persona was the same as his role as a sad space traveller in nicolas roeg’s film the man who fell to earth.bowie’s relationship with his wife had been suffering under the pressures of success and the couple divorced in 1980. this was a year of further creative triumph, bringing a fine album, scary monsters (and super creeps), and its chart-topping single, ashes to ashes, followed by a period playing the title role in the elephant man on the broadway stage.he achieved a number 1 single with his 1981 partnership with queen, under pressure, and became increasingly involved with different media. he appeared in the german movie christiane f (1981) and wrote music for the soundtrack. he had another chart hit with cat people (putting out fire) from paul schrader’s movie cat people (1982).1983 was the year in which he put his energy into the album let’s dance and follow-up concerts. let’s dance turned bowie into a crowd-friendly global rock star, with the album and its singles let’s dance, china girl and modern love all becoming huge international hits.this was the heyday of mtv and bowie’s talent for eye-catching videos increased his popularity, while the six-month serious moonlight tour drew massive crowds. it was to be the most commercially successful period of his career.at the 1985 live aid famine relief concert at wembley stadium, bowie was one of the best performers. in addition, that year, he teamed up with mick jagger to record the fundraising single dancing in the street, which quickly went to number 1.a few days after his appearance at the freddie mercury tribute concert at wembley stadium in april 1992, bowie married the somalian model iman and the couple bought a home in new york.for the album black tie white noise (1993), he included elements of soul, electronica and hip hop. it topped the uk album chart and gave him a top 10 single, jump they say.new media and technology influenced his recordings, too. his 1999 album hours… was based around music he had written for a computer game called omikron, in which bowie and iman appeared as characters. the birth of bowie and iman’s daughter, alexandria, followed in august 2000.as an adopted new yorker, bowie was the opening act at the concert for new york city in october 2001, where he joined paul mccartney, jon bon jovi, billy joel, the who and elton john in a benefit show six weeks after the 9/11 attacks.during his reality tour in 2004, bowie had chest pains while performing in germany and needed emergency surgery in hamburg.he saw the medical emergency as a warning and started to slow down. in february 2006, he was given a grammy lifetime achievement award. he was entered into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1996.the next day (2013) was his first album of new material in a decade. it included the single where are we now?, which gave him his first uk top 10 hit since 1993. the album went to the top

intermediate	flappy bird be careful what you wish for, especially if you want to invent something new. recently, dong nguyen, the designer of the mobile game flappy bird, removed it from app stores. he said its success – it had been downloaded more than 50 million times and was making him around £30,000 from advertising each day – had ruined his simple life. on his twitter account, he said: “i cannot take this anymore.” ok, so regretting making flappy bird isn’t quite the same as regretting making a rifl e, but nguyen is just the latest inventor who wished he hadn’t created a monster.the labradoodle the labradoodle isn’t a monster – it’s adorable. but what’s monstrous is the way crossbreed dogs have been sold since the labradoodle’s inventor, wally conron, fi rst created the breed in the 1980s. “i’ve done a lot of damage,” he told the associated press. “i’ve created a lot of problems. there are a lot of unhealthy and abandoned dogs out there.” conron came up with the labradoodle when he was working for the royal guide dog association of australia to provide a dog for a blind woman whose husband was allergic to dog hair. what he didn’t expect was that the labradoodle – and other types of poodle-cross dogs, many of which have health problems – would become so popular.the ak-47 six months before his death in december 2013, mikhail kalashnikov, the designer of the assault rifl e, wrote to the head of the russian orthodox church: “my spiritual torment is unbearable. if my rifl e killed people, does that mean that i, mikhail kalashnikov, 93 years of age, the son of a poor farmer, christian and orthodox by faith, am responsible for people’s deaths, even if they were enemies?”electronic tagging the electronic tag was originally made in the 1960s as a way of tracking former prisoners’ attendance at school and work, and rewarding them for good behaviour. its inventors, bob gable and his brother kirkland, were later horrifi ed that the tag had become a form of control and punishment. “it’s not pleasant,” kirkland gable told the guardian in 2010, “but i’m not in control of the universe. i have to realize there are some things out of my control.”pepper spray after police sprayed peaceful protesters with pepper spray at a university of california campus in 2011, one of the scientists who helped develop it in the 80s denounced its use. “i have never seen such an inappropriate use of chemicals,” kamran loghman told the new york times.the offi ce cubicle in the late 60s, a new form of offi ce was designed to give workers privacy and increase productivity by providing more work space. instead, it became a way for companies to put employees into tighter spaces. these days, the cubicle is often connected with uniformity and soulless work. its inventor, bob propst, said, in 1997, “the use of cubicles in modern corporations is crazy.”
intermediate	scarlett johansson is suing a french novelist for û50,000. she says that his work of  ction makes fraudulent claims about her personal life.la premiere chose quon regarde (the first thing we look at) by gregoire delacourt tells the story of a french model who looks so similar to the american actor that the books lead male character thinks it is johansson herself. in the novel, the models looks mean that men see her only as a sex object, while women are jealous of her. she has a series of adventures as johansson and, in the end, dies in a car crash.johansson does not feel  attered by the best- selling book. her lawyer, vincent toledano, told le figaro that delacourtõs novel illegally used ms johanssonõs name, her reputation and her image. he said the novel contains òdefamatory claims about her private life.ó he has now gone to court to try to stop the book being translated or adapted for cinema.delacourt tried to explain that he chose to mention johansson because she is òthe archetype of beauty today.ó he said: òi wrote a work of  ction. my character is not scarlett johansson.óon french radio, the author recently said the legal action was òrather sadó. he said: òit freaks me out to think that when you talk of a character in a novel, judges can get involved.ódelacourt is one of franceõs best-loved authors; his previous novel, my list of desires, was translated into 47 languages and is now being adapted into a  lm. but he said he was òspeechlessó when he found out johansson was suing him.òi thought sheõd get in contact to ask me to go for a coffee with her. i didnõt write a novel about a celebrity,ó he said. òi wrote a real love story about feminine beauty, especially interior beauty.òif an author can no longer mention the things that surround us ð a brand of beer, a monument, an actor ð itõs going to be complicated to produce  ction.òiõm not sure sheõs even read the novel because it hasnõt been translated yet.óemmanuelle allibert, spokeswoman for publisher jc latte_s, said taking legal action was òcrazyó. òwe have never known anything like it. it is all the more surprising because the novel is not even about scarlett johansson. it is about a woman who is scarlett johanssonõs double.óironically, the authorõs legal situation would be far easier if he had published the book in johanssonõs home country, rather than france. lloyd jassin, a new york lawyer, said that the case would most likely not go to court in the united states because the book would be protected by the first amendment.he said that, if thereõs signi cance and literary merit to using her name in the book, the first amendment would protect the authorõs right to do so. however, in france, the legal position is more complicated and personality rights are taken òmuch more seriously,ó jassin says.òi thought she might send me  owers as the book was a declaration of love for her, but she didnõt understand,ó delacourt said.nannan

elementary	mcdonaldõs is the worldõs biggest burger chain and a symbol of american consumer capitalism. but, these days, the golden arches of mcdonaldõs are not looking so golden. the company has got much bigger since 2003 but, now, the numbers of customers are falling. mcdonaldõs says that its worldwide sales have fallen by 3.3%.the company has problems almost everywhere. in china, sales fell by 23%. in europe, sales fell by 4%, mostly because of problems in ukraine and the anti-western mood in russia. health inspectors have investigated around 200 of mcdonaldõs 450 restaurants in russia and they have closed ten restaurants.but the worst crisis is in the us, where mcdonaldõs has around 40% of its restaurants. almost 60 years since ray kroc opened his  rst restaurant in des plaines, illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a big mac and fries. sales have fallen every month for 12 months in the us. many younger diners are eating at rival companies such as chipotle mexican grill. the number of 19-to-21-year-olds who visit mcdonaldõs once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011.another problem is that mcdonaldõs hamburgers were recently named the worst in america in a poll of more than 32,000 american diners ð they said they would rather eat a burger at five guys, smashburger or fuddruckers. many people also believe that mcdonaldõs is less healthy than most of its rivals, especially chipotle. chipotle uses antibiotic-free meat and òlocally sourced, seasonaló ingredients.mcdonaldõs asked customers for their opinions in the us in october. someone asked òhave you ever used pink slime in your burgers?ó ð ôpink slimeõ is the beef  ller that is used for dog food. mcdonaldõs stopped using this meat product in 2012 but mcdonaldõs chief executive don thompson said the company still had to improve peopleõs opinions about the freshness and quality of its ingredients.mcdonaldõs has always had a reputation for fast service at low prices. but, since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, people think it is more expensive than its rivals and many consumers complain that service is slower.but mary chapman at food analysts technomic said that it wasnõt fair to say that mcdonaldõs was more expensive than its rivals. òprices have gone up but they havenõt gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-food chains in the us.ó prices at mcdonaldõs have increased by 4.8% since 2009, much less than the fast-food average (up 19.4%).but people are right when they complain that the queues are longer. mcdonaldõs has a bigger menu than some other restaurants, with more complicated items ð its chicken mcwrap takes 60 seconds to make. òi think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not,ó said chapman.mcdonald managers are promising to improve peopleõs opinions about its food in the us. thompson has promised more organic food and òbuild your own burgersó. but, to reduce queues, he also wants to introduce simpler menus. how can the company have simpler menus and, at the same time, a larger selection of  llings? òthey want to simplify the menu but also offer ôbuild your own burgersõ ð that sounds tricky,ó said consumer expert mark kalinowski. only four out of mcdonaldõs 14,000 us restaurants have tested òbuild your own burgeró, he said. òright now, we are sceptical; we would like to see more detail.ósales are falling but mcdonaldõs continues to expand around the world: by the end of 2014, it expects to open 1,400 new restaurants. kalinowski thinks that mcdonaldõs sales will continue to fall but he thinks it will be number one for many years.nannannan
elementary	james bond films are one of the world’s oldest and most successful film series. twenty-three bond films have been made so far. they have earned more than $6 billion at cinemas around the world. james bond is not slowing down. in fact, the films are more popular than ever – skyfall, which broke all records and became the biggest ever film at uk cinemas in 2012, earned a total of $1.1 billion.so, there was a lot of interest when they announced more details about the 24th bond film – especially its title, spectre. the number one question is: can spectre be as successful as skyfall?charles gant, film editor for heat magazine, thinks it can. “they were very clever when they made skyfall,” he says. “it was both modern and retro. daniel craig fans liked it and, also, older, more nostalgic bond fans, who lost interest over the previous few films. with the new title,” he adds, “it is certain to be a success.”eon productions is the company, started in 1961, that made dr no and all the “official” bond films. the company really wants the next film to be successful so it is using the same people that worked on skyfall in the new film. daniel craig will play bond and the same people have written the script. most importantly, sam mendes will again be the director. according to gant, mendes is the best bond director. gant says: “mendes attracted top actors like ralph fiennes. actors like fiennes will only be in a film if they like the director.”the bond series was not in trouble before the arrival of mendes – and craig – but the films were becoming a bit boring towards the end of pierce brosnan’s time as bond. there were no longer any more original bond stories to adapt and the films no longer had enough energy.this was nothing new: the history of the bond series has been one of constant change, especially of the lead actor: first, sean connery; then, george lazenby, roger moore, timothy dalton, brosnan and, now, craig. each new actor has been different and some have been better than others.lazenby only did one bond film. dalton’s two films, the living daylights and licence to kill, were during a period in the late 80s when more aggressive hollywood action movies were more popular. according to gant, “the period of roger moore’s last films and dalton’s films didn’t excite audiences. brosnan was more successful but craig is the best. on the other hand, the early bond films were sexy and exciting.”skyfall made more money than all the other bond films. but some of the 1960s bond films were almost as successful. with figures adjusted for inflation, the 1965 film thunderball is only a little bit below skyfall. and goldfinger and you only live twice both did better than the other craig films. licence to kill made the least money of all bond films and moore’s final film, a view to a kill, the second least.martin campbell is an experienced british director and he planned one of the most elaborate stunts in bond history. in the famous first scene of goldeneye (released in 1995), bond falls into a light aeroplane without a pilot. this scene helped to make the bond series more modern and popular. also, a very successful goldeneye video game created new, younger fans of bond and made people think that the bond film was no longer boring and old-fashioned.nannannannannan
elementary	when pope benedict xvi was elected in 2005, he said he was “a simple, humble worker in god’s vineyard”. and on a grey, cold, windy monday in february, he resigned in the same way: like an old workman with pains in his back and no more strength in his arms. the first german pope in modern times gave an exact departure time. “from 28 february 2013, at 20.00 hours”, he told a gathering of cardinals in the vatican, “the see of rome, the see of saint peter, will be vacant and there will be an election for a new pope.”one of the cardinals at the gathering was a mexican cardinal, monsignor oscar sanchéz barba, from guadalajara. he was in rome for an official meeting. “we were all in the apostolic palace,” he said. “the pope took a sheet of paper and read from it.“we were all …” – sanchéz barba couldn’t find the word. the cardinals had just heard the man they believe is god’s representative on earth resign. “the cardinals were just looking at one another,” sanchéz barba said.angelo sodano, the dean of the college of cardinals, who probably already knew about the pope’s decision, gave a short speech. he told the pope that the cardinals would be loyal to him and added that he and the others present had listened to the pope’s words with a feeling of confusion. at the end of his speech, the pope blessed the cardinals and left. “it was so simple; the simplest thing you can imagine,” said sanchéz barba. “then we all left in silence. there was absolute silence … and sadness.”john thavis spent 30 years reporting on the vatican and has a book, the vatican diaries, that will be published soon. he said he had a feeling before that the pope was going to resign. thavis said that in the long interview benedict gave to a german journalist in 2010, he had said he would resign if he felt he could no longer do the job. “i asked myself: if i were pope and wanted to resign, when would i choose? he has completed his series of books and most of his projects. also, there were no dates in his calendar of events he had to attend. i thought the most likely date was 22 february but i got it wrong.”soon after the announcement, the vatican was saying that the pope’s decision was brave. thavis agreed: “what i find particularly courageous is that he is going now, when he is not sick; and that he’s leaving because he’s tired and not because he’s ill.” but is that the whole story? does the pope know more about his state of health than the vatican has so far made public?benedict said that he is resigning not just for physical reasons but also for psychological reasons. he said that the position of pope needed both strength of mind and strength of body, and in the last few months he felt that he was slowly losing that strength. there will no doubt be other theories in future days and weeks, just as there were following the death of pope john paul i in 1978, 33 days after his election. already people are saying that there was a secret in benedict’s past and that somebody was going to tell everyone. the vatican will no doubt say those stories are nonsense. but we can understand why some people think there might be a secret, because benedict’s decision is so historic.at st peter’s basilica, julia rochester, from london, still didn’t know what the pope’s resignation meant. “if you’re god’s chosen person, how do you choose not be chosen?” she asked. it is a question many catholics will be asking their priests in future weeks.
elementary	when larry pizzi first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago, he asked: “why would anyone want to spoil a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it?”it’s a question that some people still ask. many bicycle shops in the us do not sell e-bikes.pizzi is ceo of currie technologies, the number one seller of e-bikes in the us. he believes that things will change very soon. other people who sell bikes agree. familiar brands including trek, raleigh and specialized all offer electric bikes and they believe that the market is going to grow.the us is different from other countries when it comes to electric bikes. nearly 32 million e-bikes were sold in 2014, most of them in china, where people mostly use them for transportation. they are popular in many parts of europe, too. they’re common in the netherlands and switzerland; german postal workers use them and bmw sells one for about $3,000.electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds, which use motors; you pedal an electric bike with – or without – help from an electric motor. riding an e-bike feels like riding a normal bike with a strong wind behind you; the motor just helps you go faster or climb hills. you can usually ride e-bicycles on bike lanes and they can’t travel faster than 20mph.e-bikes are banned in some states in the us, including new york. some bike shops don’t like putting motors on bicycles because it makes them too heavy. some e-bikes weigh nearly 30kg.e-bikes are also expensive. while cheap bikes sell for just $700, you will pay at least $1,500 for a quality e-bike with a good battery. the best bikes cost more than $3,000.but e-bike technology, particularly the batteries, is improving. “batteries are getting smaller, they’re getting lighter, they’re getting more reliable and they are lasting longer,” says don dicostanza, the ceo of pedego, an electric bikemaker and retailer.perhaps most importantly, more cities are building bike lanes so bicycle commuting has become more popular. electric bikes make commuting more practical – and fun – because people don’t have to worry about hills, strong winds, tiredness and sweat.most of our customers are “baby boomers who want to have the cycling experience they had as a kid,” says pedego’s don dicostanza. “the main reason they stopped riding bikes was because of hills.” pedego has opened nearly 60 stores in the us.electrobike has 30 stores in mexico. it opened its first american store in venice beach, california in 2014 and hopes to have 25 us stores in a year. ceo craig anderson says: “we want to help reduce traffic, help reduce our carbon footprint and encourage a healthy lifestyle.” he tells customers: “ride this bike once and try not to smile.”currie’s larry pizzi thinks that e-bikes will become popular in north america. “a lot of young people are using e-bikes for transportation, instead of cars.”there is even a cargo bike with a stronger motor and rack at the back. “you can carry two children,” says pizzi. “you can carry 45kg of shopping. it’s a minivan alternative.”nannannannan
elementary	a group of experts say that thousands of people are taking unnecessary medicines and have bad diets because of bogus allergy tests. allergies and food intolerances are increasing very quickly but people do not understand the difference between an allergy and a food intolerance – this is causing problems, says the charity sense about science, who have written a guide to allergies.“it’s a big mess,” said tracey brown, director of sense about science. “there is unnecessary action for people who don’t really have allergies and not enough action for people who have allergies.”lots of people tell the waiter or waitress in a restaurant that they have an allergy. but some of these people don’t have an allergy – that have a food intolerance, which is not dangerous. experts fear that restaurants hear so many people say that they have allergies (when maybe that is not true) that they may not be careful enough when they give food to a person who has a real allergy.“it matters very much,” said moira austin of an allergy charity. “if a restaurant thinks somebody just doesn’t want to eat a food because it makes them feel uncomfortable, the restaurant may be less careful. there have been deaths where people have gone to a restaurant, told the waiter or waitress that they have an allergy to a food and the meal has been given to them containing that food.”the guide says most allergy tests bought on the internet or in shops do not work. they include a test people can use at home, which looks for specific antibodies against different foods in the blood. these antibodies are part of the body’s response to infections but “the best medical evidence has shown high antibody levels do not suggest an allergy”, the guide says. the test often shows people have an allergy or a food intolerance when this is not true.another test also does not work. it uses a mixture of acupuncture and homeopathy. testing hair is also pointless, the guide says. “hair cannot show if you are allergic or not so testing hair cannot give any useful information on allergies.”“i often see children who are on very limited diets – their parents believe that they have allergies because they have taken ‘allergy tests’ that do not work,” said paul seddon, an allergy doctor for children. “this needs to stop, which can only happen if we prove these ‘tests’ do not work.”allergies can cause tiredness, headaches and eczema in children. but you need to check if they have an allergy and this takes a long time and many tests. it may seem like a good idea to do just one test and get a quick answer. but, it will be a wrong answer.allergies are increasing in developed countries. there are three times more children with certain allergies now compared to 30 years ago. the sense about science guide lists a number of myths about the sources of allergies, for example the myths that fast food or e numbers in food colourings cause allergies.nan
elementary	many of us know we donõt get enough sleep but imagine if there was a simple solution: getting up later. in a speech at the british science festival, dr paul kelley from oxford university said schools should stagger their starting times to work with the natural rhythms of their students. this would improve exam results and studentsõ health (lack of sleep can cause diabetes, depression, obesity and other health problems).dr kelley said that, when children are around ten, their natural wake-up time is about 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and, at 18, a personõs natural waking hour is 9am, although you may think they are just a lazy teenager. the normal school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not for 16- to 18-year-olds. for the older teenagers, it might be better to start the school day at 11am or even later. òa 7am wake-up time for older teenagers,ó says kelley, òis the same as a 4.30am start for a teacher in their 50s.óhe says the solution is not to tell teenagers to go to bed earlier. òthe bodyõs natural rhythm is controlled by a particular kind of light,ó says kelley. òthe eye has cells that report to a part of the brain that controls our sleep rhythms over a 24-hour cycle. itõs the light that controls it.óbut it isnõt just students who would bene t from a later start. kelley says the working day should be more linked to our natural rhythms. describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: òbetween 14 and 24, people lose more than two hours. for people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35, they lose about an hour and a half. that can continue up until youõre about 55 when itõs in balance again. the 10-year-old and 55-year-old wake and sleep naturally at the same time.óso, should workplaces have staggered starting times, too? should people in their 50s and above come in at 8am, people in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage apprentice at 11am? kelley says that synchronized hours could have òmany positive effects. the positive side is that peopleõs performance, mood and health will improve. itõs very positive because itõs a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.óthere would probably be fewer accidents because drivers would be more awake, he says. it could mean the end of rush hour because people would stagger their work times and the times of their school run. a later start to the day for many, says kelley, òis something that would bene t all people, particularly families. parents go and try to wake up teenagers who are waking up three hours too early. it creates problems for everybody.óso, what time does kelley start work? òi am 67 so that means iõm like a 10-year-old and i get up just after six. i wake naturally.ó and, yes, he says he  nds the start of his working day much easier now than when he was younger.
elementary	the international monetary fund (imf) has asked the usa to manage its money better. hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work after the government shut down for 16 days.us president barack obama said that the us has to be more careful with how it manages its money. the imf’s managing director, christine lagarde, asked for more stability.the senate wrote a peace deal, which included almost nothing that the conservatives asked for. the conservative republicans nearly caused a new financial crisis because they did not agree to obama’s healthcare reforms. the house of representatives agreed the deal at the last minute.the world bank was also pleased that the world’s economy had “avoided a catastrophe”. its president, jim yong kim, asked politicians in all countries to continue to make policies that improve the economy and give jobs and opportunity to all.the shutdown cost the us $24 billion.obama signed the legislation shortly after midnight on thursday. the bill passed easily, with support from all parties in the senate, where democratic and republican leaders wrote the agreement. it is a temporary solution. it gives the government money until 15 january and allows the government to borrow more money if they want to until 7 february.but the president made clear that he did not expect another serious budget fight and shutdown in 2014.at the white house, obama said he hoped the deal would “lift the cloud of uncertainty” that had hung over the country in recent weeks.“when this agreement arrives on my desk, i will sign it immediately,” he said. “hopefully, next time, it won’t be in the eleventh hour. we must manage our money better.”a journalist asked the president if the crisis would happen again in a few months. obama replied: “no.”earlier, the republican senator mike lee said there would be more trouble: “the media keeps asking: ‘was it worth it?’ my answer is, it is always worth it to do the right thing.” he added: “this is not over.”but the political deal on wednesday was one of the worst of all possible results for republicans. they did not achieve any of their goals and most people blamed them for the crisis.nannannan
elementary	not many exercise classes have a tea break in the middle. but margaret allen’s class has one. after a gentle warm-up and a few quick exercises, the 93-year-old great-grandmother lets her group sit down and relax with a cup of tea. some of the eight people in the class look like they need a break, but allen is not even sweating.the general rule is that eating just before doing sport is not a good idea and especially not halfway through the class. but, on the afternoon i visit allen’s class in saltburnby- the-sea, they eat fruitcake during the break. the cake was made for allen’s recent birthday by her 89-year-old sister, joan.the ladies have just finished their cake when allen gets up again. she plays a lively scottish song and there is lots of toe pointing and leg kicking. forty-five minutes later, the class is finally over.allen has been leading classes in the north-east town for 45 years. she wasn’t very sporty at school, but she started playing the piano for a keep-fit class during the second world war and started leading the class in her 40s when the old instructor retired.at one time, allen’s class had more than 18 regulars, each paying £1 a time. but, these days, the group is getting smaller. during the tea break, the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them went to that week for one of the younger people in the group who died recently, aged 68.allen is the oldest, her sister the second oldest. the baby of the group is 60-year-old jean cunion, who is a bit embarrassed to say that she is perhaps the least fit of the group. “i remember, the first time i came, margaret said, ‘who’s that breathing heavily?’ and i had to say it was me.” ruth steere, 76, says allen always has her back to the class, but she always knows what’s happening: “she always shouts at us if we go wrong. she’s very good at knowing what we are doing.”allen, who loves dancing, has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor. instead, she got ideas for her own moves from five fitness videos from the bbc. allen thinks she is healthy because she keeps busy, especially since her husband died in 1997. she started writing poetry when she was 80.“i write poems about everything. i just can’t stop,” she says, when she phones me a few days after the interview to read out a poem she has written about the joys of exercise. she still plays the piano and gives speeches. she also did a computer course when she was 88.ageing is no fun, she says. she reads me a few lines from a poem she has written called ‘that beast called age’. she happily remembers a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years ago, who said he didn’t believe she was more than 78: “i said, ‘thank you, doctor. you can go now.’”she also has a practical idea for people who are overweight: “i just think people shouldn’t eat too much. when i hear someone say, ‘oh, i can’t lose weight’, i say: ‘sellotape.’” she mimes taping her mouth shut. “i said this the other day to a big fat man. everything in moderation is my motto.”earlier in 2013, allen was watching the news and saw a woman get the british empire medal. “the woman said: ‘i’m 80 and i’m the oldest fitness instructor in the country!’ i thought: ‘no, you’re not.’” but allen won’t write to the queen to complain.nannan
elementary	more than one million british workers might be employed on zero-hours contracts. this number comes from a poll of more than 1,000 employers by the chartered institute of personnel and development (cipd).recently, some uk organizations ð from shops to buckingham palace ð have been criticized for employing staff without a guarantee of work and pay each week. employees on zero-hours contracts often get no holiday or sick pay and have to ask permission before looking for extra work with another company.the cipd found that 38% of zero-hours contract workers describe themselves as employed full-time. they say they typically work 30 hours or more a week. one-third of voluntary sector employers use the contracts and one in four public sector organizations.the retail company sports direct employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on zero-hours contracts. other companies using the contracts include cinema chain cineworld and buckingham palace, which uses the contracts for its 350 summer workers. pub group j d wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff ð 80% of its workforce ð on zero-hours contracts.vidhya alakeson, from the resolution foundation, said: òif itõs true that there are around one million people on zero-hours contracts, then that would be a big part of the workforce.óunions say that employers put pressure on staff to sign the contracts. in this way, the employers can avoid their responsibilities to employees and reduce staff bene ts.dave prentis, of the trade union unison, said: òthe majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice.óworkers on zero-hours contracts are often only told how many hours they will work when weekly or monthly rotas are created. but they have to be available for extra work at short notice. they may get holiday pay, but they do not get sick pay.the charity national trust, which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts, said it gives the same pay and bene ts to workers on zero-hours contracts as to full-time staff.òwe believe zero-hours contracts are essential in our organization, because we are very weather-dependent,ó the national trust said. òitõs important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.ópolitician chuka umunna said, òwhile some employees welcome the  exibility of zero-hours contracts, for many, zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come,ó he said.the poll shows that 17% of employers in the private sector use zero-hours contracts, lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.industries where employers were most likely to have at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).nannannannan
advanced	we may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm back to the future ii, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched. experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally altering the transportation landscape. òitõs a very dynamic time,ó said robert puentes, of the brookings institutionõs metropolitan policy program think- tank. òthereõs a focus on a tighter connection between the role of transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people.óas the average us commute lengthens and the countryõs infrastructure ages badly, cities across the us are being forced to rede ne what transportation is. increasingly, urban planners, transportation experts and scientists are realizing that old auto-centric models focused on easing traf c congestion arenõt enough to tackle issues like population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now, more than ever, an integral component of a cityõs larger sustainability efforts.big us cities like los angeles, seattle and chicago are working to make better use of their streets by adding more bus lanes, augmenting pedestrian walkways and expanding their rail options, while at the same time working with the private sector on advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment, essentially making transportation intelligent. òthe most sustainable places to live are those places that have multi-modal transport systems,ó puentes said. òyou canõt be a global competitive city if you donõt have a robust transportation network.óhere are three of the key trends that experts predict will shape the transportation industry over the coming years. connectivity the rise of ride-sharing services like uber and lyft ð essentially taxis booked at the click of a smartphone button ð and apps like waze, which uses real-time traf c data to  nd the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people get around and affecting the very way in which traf c moves through a city. communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era, according to allan clelland, an expert on transportation technology.according to a recent study from the uclaõs institute of transportation studies, vehicle travel has declined among millennials ð individuals born roughly between the early 1980s and early 2000s ð compared to previous generations. according to the study, those born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives.meanwhile, those still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to waze. experts say the traf c app has eased congestion on motorways and reduced travel times for drivers but also led to a problematic rise in cars moving through residential neighbourhoods. this has angered residents, who claim the increased traf c on their quiet roads reduces their quality of life.this trend could continue as vehicle-to-vehicle data communication, as well as communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure, grows. currently, a traf c light can detect when a car is approaching but thatõs about it. companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.automation driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. however, the partial automation of cars is already underway. alexandre bayen of the university of california expects automation will progress in stages:  rst, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: essentially, vehicles that are connected electronically and travel in single  le.the idea of a fully automated transportation system is intriguing because it has the potential to improve safety by removing human error and increase the ef ciency of car owners, who can get on with other tasks during a long commute. it can also help reduce carbon emissions and traf c congestion and allow more people access to cars. but, even if driverless technology were ready to hit the roads now, it would take a long time to get fully automated given the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.to see what driverless cars might look like in action, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.environmental concern as the world races to avoid catastrophic climate change, and countries, states and cities work to meet ambitious emissions goals, these policies could also have a big impact on the future of transportation, spurring everything from zero- and low-emission vehicles to apps that encourage more walking, biking and carpooling.sharon feigon, executive director of the shared use mobility center, envisages a future where a person can use a transit pass that gives them access to numerous modes of transport in a given day. if their train is delayed, for instance, they can access a city bike, take a shuttle or rent a vehicle through a car share programme using the same pass. òweõre going to see these systems packaged together and make it as easy as possible to connect them up with each other so people can transfer seamlessly between them,ó she said.when considering the future of transportation, itõs also important to keep in mind why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. technologies and trends that reduce the need for those trips ð say, virtual meetings or telecommuting ð could also have a big impact on transportation.there was a time when the idea of a  ying car represented the height of innovation but the technologies being imagined and developed now could be seen as even more sophisticated ð and more useful in tackling the social and environmental threats that we face over the coming decades.ó
advanced	tigers are more numerous in nepal than at any time since the 1970s, a new census has revealed, giving conservationists hope that the big cats, whose numbers have been dropping across south asia for 100 years, can be saved.the number of wild royal bengal tigers in nepal has increased to 198 – a 63.6% rise in five years – the government survey showed. “this is very encouraging,” said maheshwar dhakal, an ecologist with nepal’s department of national parks and wildlife conservation.the census is based on the examination of pictures from more than 500 cameras placed in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors. more than 250 conservationists and wildlife experts worked on the survey, which cost about £250,000. dhakal said that a parallel survey was conducted in india and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013. “it will take a few more months for india, which now has 1,300 big cats in several huge protected areas, to finalize the data,” he added. nepal has pledged to double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 when the last systematic tiger count took place.increasing prosperity in asia has pushed up prices for tiger skins and the body parts used in traditional chinese medicines. international gangs pay poor local nepali significant sums to kill the cats. the skin and bones are handed to middlemen, who pass easily through the porous border to india, where the major dealers are based.one major problem is complicity between senior officials and mafia networks involved in the trade. conservation experts credit the increase in numbers to the effective policing of national parks, stronger anti-poaching drives and better management of tiger habitats in nepal, where forests cover 29% of the land. but they say nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers prey so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat.as the number of tigers has increased over the years, so have incidents of conflict with villagers. seven people were killed in attacks by tigers around national parks in 2012 compared to four in 2011, park officials said. villagers are also seeking better protection. “the government is making conservation plans for tigers. but it should also come up with plans to protect people from tigers,” krishna bhurtel, a local village headman in chitwan, told nepali newspaper nagarik. wildlife authorities captured a tiger in chitwan after it killed two people, including a villager who was pulled from his bed in may.thousands of tigers once roamed the forests in bangladesh, india and nepal. but their numbers have dropped to about 3,000, a 95% drop over a century. chitwan national park in central nepal has the highest number of adult tigers, with 120, followed by bardiya national park (50) and shukla phanta wildlife reserve (17).diwakar chapagain, who heads a world wildlife fund nepal unit that monitors wildlife trade, said tiger skins were in demand in tibet, where well-heeled people use them as festival costumes.in nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins in front of stuffed tigers for special occasions. some affluent nepali have mounted tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms. tiger bones are in high demand for use in traditional chinese medicines. “the trade in tiger parts is lucrative and fetches thousands of dollars in illegal markets,” chapagain said, highlighting the threat tigers face.
advanced	not just the identity of the man in the car park with the twisted spine, but the appalling last moments and humiliating treatment of the naked body of richard iii in the hours after his death have been revealed at an extraordinary press conference at leicester university.there were cheers when richard buckley, lead archaeologist on the hunt for the king’s body, finally announced that the university team was convinced “beyond reasonable doubt” that it had found the last plantagenet king, bent by scoliosis of the spine, and twisted further to fit into a hastily dug hole in grey friars church, which was slightly too small to hold his body.but, by then, it was clear the evidence was overwhelming, as the scientists who carried out the dna tests, those who created the computer-imaging technology to peer onto and into the bones in extraordinary detail, the genealogists who found a distant descendant with matching dna, and the academics who scoured contemporary texts for accounts of the king’s death and burial outlined their findings.“what a morning. what a story,” said philippa langley, of the richard iii society. she had been driving on the project for years, in the face of incredulity from many people, and finding funds from all over the world when it looked as if the money would run out before the excavation had even begun.work has started on designing a new tomb in leicester cathedral, only 100 yards from the excavation site, and a ceremony will be held to lay him into his new grave there, probably next year. leicester’s museums’ service is working on plans for a new visitor centre in an old school building overlooking the site.richard died at bosworth on 22 august 1485, the last english king to fall in battle, and the researchers revealed how for the first time. there was an audible intake of breath as a slide came up showing the base of his skull sliced off by one terrible blow, believed to be from a halberd, a fearsome medieval battle weapon with a razor-sharp iron axe blade weighing about two kilos, mounted on a wooden pole, which was swung at richard at very close range. the blade probably penetrated several centimetres into his brain and, said the human bones expert jo appleby, he would have been unconscious at once and dead almost as soon.the injury appears to confirm contemporary accounts that he died in close combat in the thick of the battle and unhorsed – as in the great despairing cry shakespeare gives him: “a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!” another sword slash, which also went through the bone and into the brain, would also have proved fatal. but many of the other injuries were after death, suggesting a gruesome ritual on the battlefield and as the king’s body was brought back to leicester, as he was stripped, mocked and mutilated.one terrible injury, a stab through the right buttock and into his pelvis, was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour. it suggests the story that his naked corpse was brought back slung over a horse, mocked and abused all the way, is true. bob savage, a medieval arms expert from the royal armouries who helped identify the wounds, said it was probably not a war weapon but the sort of sharp knife or dagger any workman might have carried.michael ibsen, the canadian-born furniture maker proved to be the descendant of richard’s sister, heard the confirmation on sunday and listened to the unfolding evidence in shocked silence. “my head is no clearer now than when i first heard the news,” he said. “many, many hundreds of people died on that field that day. he was a king, but just one of the dead. he lived in very violent times and these deaths would not have been pretty or quick.”it was mathew morris who first uncovered the body, in the first hour of the first day of the excavation. he did not believe he had found the king. the mechanical digger was still chewing the tarmac off the council car park, identified by years of research by local historians and the richard iii society as the probable site of the lost church of grey friars, whose priests bravely claimed the body of the king and buried him in a hastily dug grave, probably still naked, but in a position of honour near the high altar of their church. the leg bones just showing through the soil were covered up again.ten days later, on 5 september, when further excavation proved morris had hit the crucial spot, he returned with lin foxhall, head of the archaeology department, to excavate the body. “we did it the usual way, lifting the arms, legs and skull first, and proceeding gradually towards the torso – so it was only when we finally saw the twisted spine that i thought: ‘my word, i think we’ve got him.’”as far as langley is concerned, richard was the true king, the last king of the north, a worthy and brave leader who became a victim of some of the most brilliant propaganda in history, in the hands of the tudors’ imagemaker, shakespeare. there remains the dark shadow of the little princes in the tower, an infamous story even in richard’s day: the child edward v and his brother richard were declared illegitimate when richard iii claimed the throne, imprisoned in the tower of london and never seen alive again. although it is by no means certain that the bones found at the tower centuries later are theirs, there may be more dna detective work to be done there.
advanced	seaworld has suffered an 84% collapse in pro ts as customers have deserted the controversial aquatic theme park company following claims it mistreated orca whales.the company, which trains dolphins and killer whales to perform tricks in front of stadiums full of spectators, has reported declines in attendance, sales and pro ts because of òcontinued brand challengesó.seaworld has been in the headlines since the 2013 documentary black sh detailed claims that its treatment of orca whales provoked violent behaviour, contributing to the deaths of three people. following the release of the documentary, attendance collapsed, the company lost more than half of its market value on wall street and its former ceo was forced out.the company has since launched a nationwide marketing campaign to combat animal rights activists claims that, among other things, captive orcas die at a younger age than their wild counterparts.despite cutting ticket prices and spending $10m on the marketing blitz, which features its veterinarians caring for whales, seaworld ceo joel manby was forced to admit that the company is still struggling to convince the public that it treats its whales well.òwe realize we have much work ahead of us to recover more of our attendance base, increase revenue and improve our performance, as returning to historical performance levels will take time and investment,ó manby said. òon the reputation side, early feedback on our campaign has been positive. however, we recognize that fully resolving our brand challenges in california will require sustained focus and commitment to correct misinformation.óòwe will continue to  ght with the facts because the facts are on our side,ó he said recently on a conference call with journalists and analysts. manby, who joined the company as ceo in 2015 to help the company rehabilitate itself, said he would set out his vision for the future of the company at a special event on 6 november.already in the pipeline are plans for a new shark exhibition in orlando and an attraction in san antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a ònaturalisticó setting.the companyõs  nancial report, released on 6 august, showed net income in the second quarter dropped from $37.4m in 2014 to $5.8m in 2015, an 84% decrease. revenue fell from $405m to $392m. attendance dropped by more than 100,000 from 6.58 million to 6.48 million.analysts will now be closely watching seaworldõs sales and attendance numbers in the third quarter, which is traditionally the companyõs most pro table and covers the summer holiday season. attendance may suffer from a fresh scandal in july 2015, in which a seaworld employee was alleged to have in ltrated animal rights protest groups against the company.jared goodman, director of animal law for people for the ethical treatment of animals (peta), which has been leading campaigns against seaworld, said: òseaworld is in the midst of a spying scandal, animals are dying in its tanks and tens of thousands of people have opposed its bid to build a new orca prison so it should come as no surprise that seaworldõs quarterly earnings have plummeted yet again in the second quarter. families just donõt want to buy tickets to see orcas going insane inside tiny tanks and seaworldõs pro ts, like the orcas, wonõt recover until the abusement park empties its tanks and builds coastal sanctuaries.óseaworldõs shares, which were worth $39 in 2013, were changing hands for just under $18 in august 2015.

advanced	margaret thatcher, the most dominant british prime minister since winston churchill in 1940 and a global champion of the late 20th-century free market economic revival, has died. the british government announced that she would receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours at st paul’s cathedral.the british prime minister, david cameron, who is cutting short his trip to europe to return to london following the news, said: “it was with great sadness that l learned of lady thatcher’s death. we’ve lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great briton.” he added: “as our first woman prime minister, margaret thatcher succeeded against all the odds, and the real thing about margaret thatcher is that she didn’t just lead our country, she saved our country, and i believe she will go down as the greatest british peacetime prime minister.”in a statement, president barack obama said, “here in america, many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with president reagan, reminding the world that we are not simply carried along by the currents of history – we can shape them with moral conviction, unyielding courage and iron will.”the first woman elected to lead a major western state, lady thatcher, as she became after the longest premiership since 1827, served 11 unbroken years at no 10 downing street.thatcher, who was 87, had been in declining health for some years, suffering from dementia. after a series of mini-strokes in 2002, thatcher withdrew from public life, no longer able to make the kind of waspish pronouncements that had been her forte in office – and beyond.her death was greeted with tributes from across the political spectrum.as labour sources announced the party would suspend campaigning in local elections as a mark of respect, its leader, ed miliband, said: “she will be remembered as a unique figure. she reshaped the politics of a whole generation. she was britain’s first woman prime minister. she moved the centre ground of british politics and was a huge figure on the world stage. the labour party disagreed with much of what she did and she will always remain a controversial figure. but we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength.”the deputy prime minister, nick clegg, said: “margaret thatcher was one of the defining figures in modern british politics. whatever side of the political debate you stand on, no one can deny that as prime minister she left a unique and lasting imprint on the country she served.”describing her as a political phenomenon, the former tory prime minister sir john major said: “her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.”the “iron lady” proved a significant cold war ally of the us president ronald reagan in the final showdown with the soviet union, which broke up under reformist pressures led by mikhail gorbachev, a kremlin leader with whom thatcher famously declared she could “do business”. as a result, many ordinary voters in ex-soviet bloc states saw her as a bold champion of their liberty, a view widely shared across the spectrum of mainstream us opinion – though not at home or among key eu partners.thatcher was an unremarkable mid-ranking conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975. within a decade, she had become known around the world – both admired and detested – for her pro-market domestic reforms and her implacable attitudes in foreign policy, including her long-running battle with the ira, which almost managed to murder her when it placed a bomb in the grand hotel, brighton, in 1984.at home, the emerging doctrine of thatcherism meant denationalization of state-owned industry – the new word “privatization” came into widespread use in many countries – and defeat of militant trade unionists, notably the national union of miners, whose year-long strike (1984– 85) was bitter and traumatic.boosted by the newly arrived revenues from britain’s north sea oil fields, thatcher had room to manoeuvre and change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies – including moderate members of her own party.but she also deployed her notorious “handbaggings”, or verbal attacks, in the european union to obtain a british rebate – “my money” as she called it. she was less successful in fending off the centralizing ambitions of the “belgian empire”, her description of the european commission, especially in the years when it was headed by the french socialist jacques delors.her allies in the tabloid press egged her on. and, as the british economy recovered from the severe recession that her monetarist medicine had inflicted on it – to tame the unions and cure inflation – she briefly seemed invincible.but untrammelled power, with the defeat or retirement of allies who had kept her in check, led to mistakes and growing unpopularity. when sir geoffrey howe, nominally her deputy, finally fell out with thatcher – chiefly over europe – his devastating resignation speech triggered a leadership challenge. thatcher made way for john major rather than risk losing to him in a ballot.in retirement, she wrote highly successful memoirs in two volumes and campaigned energetically on behalf of the thatcher foundation, which sought to promote her values around the world.
advanced	our new international survey across 33 countries shows just how wrong the world is about a range of key social realities.british people think the top 1% wealthiest households own 59% of their countryõs wealth, when they actually òonlyó own 23%. americans think that 33% of their population are immigrants, when in fact it is only 14%.brazilians think the average age in their country is 56, when it is only 31. russians think that 31% of their politicians are women, when it is only 14%.in britain, people think that an extraordinary 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%. in india, the online population think 60% of the whole country also has internet access, when in fact only 19% do.why are people across the world so often so clueless about these realities?it is partly that we just struggle with basic maths and some of us clearly misunderstand the questions or interpret them differently. for example, most countries hugely overestimate how many people do not af liate themselves with a religion: across the 33 countries, 37% do not, according to respondents, but the average is actually just 18%. this will be partly because we will be thinking of how many people practise their religion, rather than what they put on census forms. people also take mental shortcuts, where they grab for easily available information even if it doesnõt quite  t the question. our huge overestimates of the rural populations in most countries will be affected by how much of the physical landmass rural areas make up, rather than a careful calculation of how unoccupied it generally is. in daniel kahnemanõs terms, answers to these sorts of questions are classic examples of òfastó thinking, rather than òslowó.we are tied to our own perspective and struggle to imagine the variety in our countries, as highlighted by our indian sampleõs massively overestimating their populationõs access to the internet. our study was mostly carried out through an online survey ð and, in developing countries, this will be representative of a more af uent, connected group rather than the population as a whole. in some ways, we may have expected this more educated sample to get closer to reality ð those with higher education levels tend to be more accurate on these types of questions. but what we  nd, throughout the study, is that people grossly generalize from their own situations, forgetting how unrepresentative they are.we suffer from what social psychologists call òemotional innumeracyó when estimating realities: this means we are sending a message about what is worrying us as much as trying to get the right answers. cause and effect run both ways, with our concern leading to our misperceptions as much as our misperceptions creating our concern.for britain, this is likely to be part of the explanation for peopleõs huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own, how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when it is really only 13%, according to of cial estimates). people are worried about the concentration of wealth, the housing pressures facing young people and immigration levels, and this is re ected in them overstating the scale of the issues. but, the survey suggests there are also some issues where people are not as worried as they should be. for example, most countries hugely underestimate how much of their population is overweight or obese. the worst case is saudi arabia, where people think only 28% are, when 71% are. britons think it is 44%, when it is actually nearly half as much again ð 62% are either overweight or obese.and, in many ways, it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study. the top 1% in russia own 70% of the nationõs wealth, while the top 1% in new zealand only own 18%. half of italians aged 25-34 still live with their parents, when it is only 4% in norway. the average age in india is 27; it is 47 in japan. only 10% of politicians are women in brazil, hungary and japan, when 44% are in sweden. when the reality is so strange and varied, it is no wonder weõre so wrong.
advanced	jmw turner, one of britain’s greatest painters, is to be the face of the new £20 note, following a nationwide vote.it will be the first time an artist has appeared on a british banknote, after the governor of the bank of england, mark carney, asked the public to nominate a deceased cultural figure they felt deserved the high honour.turner, renowned for his dramatic seascapes, beat off competition from 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, film-makers and actors put forward by 30,000 members of the public.the list included alfred hitchcock, alexander mcqueen, derek jarman, laura ashley, william morris and vanessa bell, which was then narrowed down by a panel of artists, critics and historians to a final choice of five.the final five – barbara hepworth, charlie chaplin, josiah wedgwood, william hogarth and turner – were selected on the basis of their “unquestioned” contribution to both the visual arts and british society as a whole, as well as their enduring influence.fittingly, the announcement of the new banknote was made at the turner contemporary gallery in margate, which stands on the former site of mrs booth’s lodging house, where turner would always stay when he visited. the announcement was made jointly by carney and the artist tracey emin, who grew up in the town.carney said it had been “so important to get this right and have a proper process that involved the public,” adding that, far from banknotes being purely a practical necessity, “if done properly, they can be a piece of art in everyone’s pocket”.“money is memory for a country and its people,” said the bank of england governor. “banknotes of the bank of england are a celebration of the uk’s heritage, a salute to its culture, a testament to its great achievements, including those of its most notable citizens. in short, money has not just economic value, it has cultural value as well.“the fact that we will have turner on the £20 note shows now that the british people are a nation of people who appreciate creativity and appreciate the arts,” said emin.the note will feature turner’s 1799 self-portrait, which currently hangs in tate britain, as well as one of his most recognizable works, the fighting temeraire, a tribute to the ship that played a distinguished role in nelson’s victory at the battle of trafalgar in 1805.emblazoned on the note will also be a quote from the artist – “light is therefore colour” – as well as his signature, taken from his will, in which he bequeathed many of his works to the nation.the new £20 note, which replaces the one featuring social philosopher and economic theorist adam smith, will enter circulation by 2020. this is the first time the public have been given a say over whose face appears on a british banknote.carney overhauled the process in 2013, following a high-profile campaign to ensure that women, apart from the queen, remained on banknotes, after the bank decided to phase out the elizabeth fry £5 note.historical figures were first introduced onto banknotes in 1970. turner joins winston churchill and jane austen as the significant figures who will feature on the new polymer notes – a plastic-type material that the new notes will all be made from – churchill on the £5 and austen on the £10 note. following in the footsteps of florence nightingale and elizabeth fry, the pride and prejudice author is only the third woman to be the face of british currency.turner was born in 1775 in london, the son of a barber, and he entered the royal academy schools at the age of 14. it was 1786, when he was sent to margate, that his love affair with painting and drawing the north-east kent coast began. he would return to that coast throughout his life and it was where he painted some of his most dramatic oils and watercolours, describing its skies as “the loveliest in all europe”.turner was a particularly prolific artist, producing more than 550 oil paintings and 2,000 watercolours over his lifetime. his life was also the subject of a film, in 2014, by mike leigh, with timothy spall taking on the role of the complex artist.victoria pomery, the director of turner contemporary, said: “the decision to celebrate jmw turner, one of the greatest technical pioneers in the history of british art, is extraordinary, not least because it has proven by a public vote that turner is the nation’s favourite artist. brilliantly, it is an official acknowledgment of the immense historical value of the visual arts to the uk.“but it is also a stark reminder that we must place increasing value on our future as a nation of creative minds. we must invest to support the next great artists and innovators.”
advanced	europe is to become the first place in the world to force ‘real-world’ emissions tests on car makers, opening up a new front in the fight to tackle air pollution. new regulations will introduce the tests to reveal what cars’ emissions are like when driving on roads and in traffic rather than in ideal, laboratory-like conditions, as is currently the case.green lit by european commission vice president, frans timmermans, the tests are designed to enforce a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre, a level met by only one car out of 16, according to researchers. other countries, such as china and korea, which are also considering real-world emissions tests, will be watching what happens next closely.pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and particulates are thought to be responsible for at least one quarter of the 29,000 annual pollution-related deaths in the uk alone. that figure is likely to rise, when the committee on the medical effects of air pollutants publishes what it calls “strengthening evidence” of damage to public health from nitrogen oxide emissions later in 2015.but the current ‘new european drive cycle’ laboratory test for measuring these emissions is a quarter of a century old and has been outpaced by technological developments in the car industry. studies have shown that the results of lab techniques to measure car emissions can easily be fixed by using techniques such as taping up doors and windows to minimize air resistance, driving on unrealistically smooth roads and testing at improbably high temperatures. campaigners say that car makers also use tricks such as programming vehicles to go into a low emissions mode when their front wheels are spinning and their back wheels are stationary, as happens in such lab experiments.“the commission is finalizing a proposal to introduce a new emissions testing procedure that will allow proper assessment of the vehicles in real driving,” said lucia caudet, a commission spokesperson. the proposal still needs approval from other commissioners and a technical committee but “we don’t expect any major internal hurdles,” a european union (eu) source added.“one key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 citizens annually is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars, causing many times more pollution on the road,” said greg archer, the clean vehicles manager for transport and environment. “the development of a new, real-world driving emission test is an important step forward in tackling urban air pollution. eu states should now support the commission’s proposals and ignore the whingeing from car makers that the rules are too tough.”according to research by the international council on clean transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg/km standard, with some models running at 22 times above the recommended limit. only one car out of 16 met the 80g target. around one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport – mostly diesel – and, in urban areas, concentrations can rise as high as 64%, european environment agency figures indicate.campaigners say that the car industry has tried to delay reforms to car test cycles but industry groups deny this, arguing that a five-year lead-time is necessary for technical and economic reasons. “real driving emissions (rde) is a totally new regulation that will force significant emission control hardware changes that may be demanded in the middle of a vehicle’s production lifetime,” said cara mclaughlin, a spokesperson for the european automobile manufacturers association (acea). “however, acea fully accepts that rde will apply to new types of cars from september 2017.”in an unusual move, the car association sent timmermans a draft regulation of their own for him to consider, after eu representatives finally agreed a regulation to implement the nitrogen oxide limits with beefed-up road trials and strict monitoring of exhaust fumes. acea’s draft regulation would have covered fewer pollutants and further delayed the regulation’s phased introduction until 2020. test distances would have been shortened from 1,300m to below 700m, minimum temperatures would have been raised from -7c to -3c and more rural roads would have been used. “the lobbyists were all over this,” archer said. “this was a real attempt at subversion of the legislative process.”after timmerman’s apparent rejection of the acea proposal, the regulation will now pass to commissioners for a rubber stamp, and member states for final amendments, before an expected introduction in september. by 2017, the first real-world car emissions tests are expected to begin in earnest. with a similar battle already looming over the testing of co2 emissions for cars at the end of 2015 – and with comparable debates in other countries – the introduction of the eu’s new emissions tests will be watched closely.
advanced	vienna is the worldõs best city to live in, baghdad is the worst and london, paris and new york do not even make it into the top 35, according to international research into quality of life.german-speaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th mercer quality of life study, with vienna joined by zurich, munich, dusseldorf and frankfurt in the top seven.paris has tumbled down the league, falling ten places to 37th, just ahead of london at 39th, almost entirely because of the cityõs vulnerability to terrorist attacks.the study examined social and economic conditions, health, education, housing and the environment, and is used by big companies to assess where they should locate and how much they should pay staff.viennese-born helena hartlauer, 32, said she was not surprised at her cityõs top position. the municipalityõs social democratic government has a long tradition of investing in high-quality social housing, making vienna almost uniquely affordable among major cities.òi live in a 100sq-metre turn-of-the-century apartment in a good area about 20 minutesõ walk from the city centre. but my rent is just û800 (£625) a month.ó an equivalent apartment in london would cost upwards of £2,000 and even more in new york, ranked 44th in the table.us cities perform relatively poorly in the study, largely because of issues around personal safety and crime. the highest ranking city in the us is san francisco, at 28th; boston is 34th. canadian cities, led by vancouver, far outrank their us rivals in the table.òyou donõt realize how safe vienna is until you head abroad,ó said hartlauer. òwe also have terri c public transport, with the underground working 24 hours at weekends, and it only costs û1 per trip.óvienna bene ted enormously from the fall of the berlin wall, becoming the gateway to eastern european countries that often have historic ties to the former austro-hungarian empire.òour big usp is our geographical location,ó said martin eichtinger, austrian ambassdaor to london, who lived in vienna for 20 years. òthe fall of the berlin wall helped de ne vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in central europe.óaccording to the world bank, austria has one of the highest  gures for gdp per head in the world, just behind the us and ahead of germany and britain, although quite some way below neighbouring switzerland.zurich in switzerland is named by mercer as having the worldõs second highest quality of life but the viennese say their city is far more fun. òthere are more students in vienna than any other german-speaking city,ó said hartlauer. òitõs a very fast growing, young and lively city,ó she added ð though she conceded she works for the cityõs tourist board.vienna has long been overlooked by british weekend city break tourists, who instead  ock to barcelona or berlin and tend to think of austria as somewhere for skiing, lakes and mountains.but, after an increase in budget  ights from regional british cities such as manchester and edinburgh, vienna is fast catching up as a popular destination. in 2015, there were 588,000 british visitors to vienna, up 18% on the year before. the  ow is both ways; eichtinger said london has become the number one city destination for austrian visitors.òvienna has ranked top in the last seven published rankings,ó said mercer. òit scores highly in a number of categories; it provides a safe and stable environment to live in, a high level of public utilities and transport facilities and good recreational facilities.óthe european migrant crisis, which has seen large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers pass through vienna en route to germany, has had little impact on the city of nearly 1.8 million people, said eichtinger. òwe have managed to accommodate 90,000 refugees in austria but the numbers have slowed in recent months.ólondon has never been in the quality-of-life top ten, says mercer, damaged by its poor scores for air pollution, traf c congestion and climate. after london, edinburgh is the next-ranking british city, in 46th place.paris has suffered the biggest fall in the most recent rankings. òparis remained stable for several years but has, this year, dropped ten places in the overall ranking,ó said mercer.òthe drop was essentially due to the terrorist attacks in 2015. however, it is important to highlight that safety issues are a very highly weighted factor within the ôbasketõ so any small adjustments can have a big impact on the ranking.óauckland in new zealand was the highest ranking english-speaking city in the survey, in third place, followed by vancouver in  fth. australian cities also perform very highly in the survey, with sydney 10th and melbourne 15th. the economist has consistently ranked melbourne as the worldõs most liveable city, although its survey has been criticized as too anglocentric.war and political unrest are behind all the worst-ranked cities in the world. surprisingly, damascus is named as only the seventh worst, ranked better than not just baghdad but also bangui in central african republic, sanaõa in yemen, port-au-prince in haiti, khartoum in sudan and nõdjamena in chad.
