elementary	wales will become the first country in the uk that will assume that people agree to donate their organs, if they haven’t opted out.the welsh assembly voted to accept the opt-out scheme, which will allow hospitals to assume that people who die want to donate, if they have not registered an objection.“this is a very big day for wales and, most importantly, for the 226 people in wales who are waiting for an organ transplant,” said the welsh health minister, mark drakeford.“i am proud that wales will be the first nation in the uk to take this step. we have shown we are ready to take action to increase organ donation and to give hope to those people who wait every week for a transplant.“when family members know that organ donation is what the dead person wanted, they usually agree to the donation. the new law will make clearer people’s wishes about organ donation and so it will increase the number of donations.”the issue is controversial, but the government says they will protect the dead person’s and the family’s wishes. relatives will have a “clear right of objection”, which will give them the chance to show that their relative did not want to be an organ donor.wales has acted because it does “not have enough organs for people who need them,” said drakeford. “about one person every week dies in wales while on a waiting list.“about a third of the people who live in wales are on the organ donor register, but more than two-thirds of people say they are happy to be organ donors. that other third is people who don’t find the time to put their names on the register.”the new law would apply to anybody over 18 who has lived in wales for at least the year before his or her death. donated organs would not only go to people in need of a transplant in wales but to anybody in the uk.doctors are delighted at the scheme. big efforts have been made in recent years to increase the number of those who carry an organ donation card, with a lot of success. hospitals have also become better at organizing transplants – for example, they have important discussions with relatives when no one knows what the wishes of the dead person were. but the increase in numbers of organs is still not enough.some religious groups strongly oppose the scheme. members of the muslim council of wales and the south wales jewish representative council are not happy, while the archbishop of wales, barry morgan, said that “donation ought to be a gift of love, of generosity. if organs can be taken unless someone has explicitly registered an objection, that’s not an expression of love. it’s more a medical use of a body.”nannannannannannannan
intermediate	the high court in london has ruled that three elderly kenyans detained and tortured during the mau mau rebellion have the right to sue. now the british government is afraid that thousands of legal claims may follow, from people who were imprisoned and who say they were treated badly during the final days of the british empire.the government’s lawyers said that too much time had passed since the seven-year insurgency in the 1950s and it was no longer possible to hold a fair trial, but the court rejected these claims. in 2011 the same judge rejected the government’s claim that the three claimants should sue the kenyan government because it had inherited britain’s legal responsibilities on independence in 1963.human rights activists in kenya estimate more than 5,000 of the 70,000 people detained by the british colonial authorities are still alive. many may bring claims against the british government. the ruling may also make it possible for victims of colonial atrocities in other parts of the world to sue.the foreign office said that the ruling had “potentially significant legal implications”, and said it was planning to appeal. “the normal time limit for bringing a civil action is three to six years,” a spokesman said. “in this case, that period has been extended to over 50 years despite the fact that the key decision makers are dead and unable to give their view of what happened.”the historic victory for paulo muoka nzili, 85, wambugu wa nyingi, 84, and jane muthoni mara, 73, was the result of a three-year battle in the courts. their lawyers said they had suffered “unspeakable acts of brutality”. in the kenyan capital nairobi, nyingi and mara, heard the news by mobile phone. they had been sitting silently with their supporters in a garden and reacted with joy when the word came, hugging, dancing and raising their hands to the sky to pray.nyingi, who was detained for about nine years, beaten unconscious and still has the scars, said: “for me … i just wanted the truth to be out. even the children of my children should know what happened. what should happen is that people should be compensated so they can begin to forgive the british government.” mara said: “i’m very happy and my heart is clean.” when she was asked what she would tell her four children, she said simply: “i will tell them i won.”the judge said in 2011 that there was “ample evidence … that there may have been systematic torture of detainees”. on friday he ruled that a fair trial was possible, and highlighted the fact that thousands of secret files from the colonial era appeared in 2011.the british government’s lawyers tried to have the claims rejected but they accepted that all three of the elderly kenyans were tortured by the colonial authorities. the claimants’ lawyer said: “the british government has admitted that these three kenyans were brutally tortured but they have been trying to avoid any legal responsibility. there will undoubtedly be victims of colonial torture from malaya to the yemen, from cyprus to palestine, who will be reading this judgment with great care.”a number of veterans of the insurgency in cyprus in the 1950s watched the case closely. one has already met the mau mau claimants’ lawyers. any cypriot claimants could rely not only on british documents, but also on the archives of the international committee of the red cross in geneva. those files are kept secret for 40 years, and then opened to public examination. the red cross documented hundreds of torture cases in cyprus.there may also be claims from malaysia, where large numbers of people were detained during the 12-year war with communist insurgents and their supporters that began in 1948. relatives of 24 unarmed rubber plantation workers who were killed by british troops are currently fighting through the british courts for a public inquiry. many former prisoners of the british in aden may also have claims against the british government, although aden is now part of yemen, and british lawyers may have problems making contact with possible clients there.nannannan
intermediate	ever since he was diagnosed hiv positive, moses king, 48, has had one major problem. he has been able to cope with the stigma of being hiv positive – widespread in liberia – and he was able to access antiretroviral medication, distributed by the liberian government. but king and his family of six children could not get the right food to eat. a subsistence farmer, he grew vegetables and bought rice. but he could not afford meat and fish – expensive, luxury products in liberian markets but essential sources of protein.pate k chon, a counsellor who works with hiv sufferers in liberia, provided a surprising solution. since watching a documentary about a fish farm in thailand several years earlier, she had thought of setting up a similar project in liberia, allowing hiv sufferers to have work and also access a stable source of protein.“i saw this film about fish in a cement pool and i thought it was a good idea,” said chon, herself diagnosed with hiv in 1992. “so many of the people i work with don’t have the money to have a balanced protein diet and fish is such a clean source of protein – it doesn’t cause health problems like other sources, and it is something we can farm.”chon began building a pool in which to farm fish. in june 2012, chon met john sheehy, a philanthropist. sheehy raised money for the non-profit fish farm in the northeast of monrovia, liberia’s capital, and set about learning about fish farming, doing an online course through cornell university and speaking to other fish farmers in africa.“i raised the money and built the farm, learned the proper tank layout and water flow system,” said sheehy. “a lot of my knowledge was self-taught, and now i would love to be able to write a manual and share it with other people,” he added.the project has now grown into the grow2feed liberia fish farm, with 12 tanks, which, when full, will each have 5,000 fish – providing up to 200,000 fish per year, serving a community of 1,200 mainly hiv-positive people, including king and his family.in addition to the fish, waste from the tanks is collected and used to irrigate crops, also providing food and money for the community.“the members of the community live near the farm, and have agreed to be part of the co-operative,” said sheehy. “many work on the farm and what they get in return is fish. they can use those fish to feed themselves and to sell in the market so that they get money to buy other essential items. the fish farm gives these people with hiv a way of getting back into society – now they are trading with people in the market every week.”according to liberia’s health survey,1.5% of liberia’s 3.5 million people are hiv positive, with 60% of those women or girls. stigma and discrimination still surround the illness, and around half of all people with hiv in the country are untreated.good nutrition is particularly important for people with hiv. research has shown they need much higher levels of protein to stop their health deteriorating and to allow healthy growth. “nutrition is one of the key things if you are taking antiretroviral drugs,” said chon. “the drugs are toxic and, if you don’t have food to eat, they can make you very ill. but food in liberia is very expensive. we buy expensive imported rice, even though we should be growing it ourselves and fish is difficult for most people to afford.”“fish farming is absolutely possible in africa,” said paul white, owner of the hydrofish fish farm in ivory coast, which produces 3,000 tonnes of fish each year. “a lot of the fish on the market comes from china and is imported frozen. it is of a quality that could never enter europe or america.” he said there had been a lack of investment in fish production but that things were changing now.some critics are sceptical of farmed fish, saying fish can be inbred and have high levels of toxins. but sheehy said good practice can reduce these problems. “a lot of farmed fish is inbred, which does cause problems, but we are using a process with local fish from liberia, not fish from another region,” said sheehy. “and we are not using lakes that are cornered off, where the fish absorb all the toxins in the lake. we can control the environment using the tanks and we test the water and monitor it constantly.”sheehy hopes to open more fish farms throughout liberia and the region. “a rice-growing co-op in sierra leone asked us if we could do this on our property so that they can feed their workers and we have had interest from nigeria and central america,” said sheehy. “but we operate 100% non-profit and we always will.”nannannannan
elementary	in 2010, it was too dangerous for the police to enter the old part of the city of srinagar in india. violent separatists were fighting for an independent kashmir and they had killed more than 100 people there.but things change very quickly. the same streets are now full of tourists. the mosque where young people threw stones at the security forces will soon be part of an official walking tour. visitors can take photos in the beautiful gardens by the lake. during the winter, the nearby ski resorts were full of rich russians.in 2002, only 27,000 tourists came to visit the kashmir valley. others were scared because of the anti-indian fighting – almost 70,000 people have died during the fighting. so far in 2012, almost one million people have visited the area – this includes more than 23,000 from outside india. but fewer than 150 britons visited – mainly because the uk government’s advice is that the area is too dangerous to visit.omar abdullah, the chief minister of jammu and kashmir, has asked the british government to change its advice, but they haven’t changed it. “it’s frustrating,” says abdullah. “today, because of that travel advice, people’s insurance isn’t valid when they visit here.” 1995 was the last time foreign tourists were murdered in kashmir, when an islamist group kidnapped six westerners and killed five of them.“british citizens have been killed more recently in other countries. i mean, how many british citizens were killed on 9/11? did you stop people from visiting new york? you’ve lost them in spain, in bali,” said abdullah. “we’ve lost indians in london. there is still a possibility that al-qaida could do something stupid, but we haven’t stopped indians from travelling to london. there is no reason to say kashmir, or even srinagar, is a dangerous destination.”germany changed its guidelines for travellers to the region in 2011. “foreigners are usually not direct targets,” the new guidelines said, less than a year after the fighting in 2010. a national holiday on 15 august celebrated 65 years of indian independence – in the past, this was a dangerous day because many people in the state do not feel part of india. but there was no trouble at the independence celebrations on wednesday.abdullah says tourists are safe in kashmir, if they are careful. in other words, do not go trekking near the border that separates the indian and pakistani parts of kashmir.some visitors may feel it is not right to have fun in a place where local people have very high levels of anxiety and lots of mental health problems. but the local people in srinagar like tourism. amjid gulzar, 26, said abdullah should encourage foreign visitors. “without tourism, our economy will be in chaos,” he said.“we need better roads, reliable electricity. we need more things for tourists to do in the evening – we don’t even have one cinema in this city,” he said. but will tourists feel welcome? in june, a local islamic group wrote a “dress code” for foreign tourists. abdullah says: “nobody wants tourists to come here and cover their faces. but they should be sensitive to our cultural identity and dress appropriately. i think that’s common sense.”abdullah said tourism would help the economy. kashmir’s economy is weak after more than twenty years of fighting. the state receives just £72 million each year in taxes but it pays £155 million in salaries to 500,000 public employees. it is clear why he needs to find more money. he is pleased to see tourists back. “i’m not saying that one million tourists here shows that everything is normal again,” he said. “but it gives me some satisfaction that people can come, have a nice time, and go back.”
intermediate	we asked five people who do some unusual jobs how much they are paid, what the worst parts are and why they enjoy their work.1. dog-food taster the job: tasting dog food to make sure it meets a top brand’s quality standardswhat it involves: opening sample tins of each batch of dog (or cat) food, smelling it and eating it. “although dogs’ sense of taste is different from ours, tasting is an important quality check to ensure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced in just the right way,” says philip wells, the chief taster for lily’s kitchen pet food.typical salary: £20,000 for an entry-level job in the quality department. however, wells says an experienced technical director can easily earn £50,000 or more.worst part of the job: the deadlines, for wells, who admits he quite likes the food. the meat used in pet food has to come from animals that are fit for human consumption, under the animal feed regulations 2010. he adds: “there are some pretty terrible pet foods out there and, although i don’t taste them, the smell is enough to turn the stomach.job satisfaction: “no two days are ever the same.” wells finds it rewarding that a project he has worked on will “help pets to become happier and healthier”. however, he acknowledges that some of the credit must go to another “key member” of the tasting team: lily, the border terrier.2. hygiene technician the job: disinfecting areas that might have been exposed to bio-hazardous situationswhat it involves: cleaning up crime scenes, road accidents and suicides. clearing houses full of rubbish, rats and excrement … among other things. “the job is about keeping people safe,” says richard lewis, a hygiene technician for rentokil. “we deal with some extremely dirty sites.”typical salary: the entry-level salary is usually around £14,500 and a top salary can be up to £22,000.worst part of the job: cleaning up after suicides. “you get used to the job being disgusting but the emotional side of it is still hard,” he says. “you also need to have a sense of humour because some days can be difficult.”job satisfaction: lewis finds the variety of tasks exciting. “one day, i’m cleaning up after a dead body; another day, i’m in a prison cell or high in the air being lowered down into a silo to clean it.” he also takes pride in the changes he makes: “it’s satisfying to make a hazardous site safe again. and it benefits society.”3. biogas engineer the job: setting up biogas plants in developing countrieswhat it involves: linking a system – which can be filled with human excrement, animal dung and other waste products – to toilets to produce a biogas that can be used for cooking and lighting. “you have to know what size and shape the mixing pit needs to be, how to create the best temperature for the process and where to build the biogas plant,” says baburam paudel, chief technical officer in nepal for the charity renewable world.typical salary: an entry-level salary is around £10,000, while a typical salary for a chief technical officer is £30,000.worst part of the job: for paudel, it’s seeing people struggling to survive on very little income. “you have to be willing to get your hands dirty during the build process and inspections. unsurprisingly, the anaerobic digestion (the process that takes place when bacteria eat the waste and produce methane) smells like rotten eggs. it can be disgusting and there is no room for mistakes.”job satisfaction: “i find it very satisfying to know that i am helping people to increase their incomes and allowing girls to go to school by replacing the need to collect firewood,” says paudel. “my work improves the health and hygiene of whole communities.”4. eel ecologist the job: conserving the critically endangered european eelwhat it involves: to monitor the size of the endangered eels, ecologists walk into the thames and other london rivers full of eels, sometimes up to their armpits, and reach into a net filled with up to 20 adult eels to take one out with their bare hands. “adult eels can be a metre long, or even larger, and weigh up to 2kg. they’re not at all dangerous but they are almost pure muscle and they can be a little bit slimy,” says stephen mowat, an eel conservationist and ecologist for the zoological society of london. “we have to weigh and measure them, and they wriggle … a lot. it’s difficult to look professional while crawling on the ground chasing an eel across the grass.”worst part of the job: “eels are really tricky creatures to work with” says mowat. “you also have to be ready to jump from one project to the next. i once had to cut up some dead eels to examine parasites living in them, moments before putting on a suit for a meeting.” but, for mowat, the worst part of the job is definitely not handling the eels – he believes baby eels (known as elvers) are “as cute as pandas”: “the worst thing about the job is regularly learning how much damage we are doing to the environment.”job satisfaction: “working outdoors and seeing british wildlife up close is the best part of the job,” says mowat. “eels are beautiful creatures and working with eels doesn’t just benefit the eel – it helps rivers and coastal areas. that is something worth doing.”5. shopping channel presenter the job: selling and demonstrating a wide range of products on live tvwhat it involves: presenting hours and hours of monotonous tv, while, at the same time, demonstrating the products and appearing to be enthusiastic and knowledgeable about everything that you’re selling. “i prepare and research as much technical and practical information as possible on every single product beforehand,” says shaun ryan, presenter for ideal world tv.typical salary: a trainee presenter would start on a minimum of £30,000, while an experienced presenter can expect over £55,000.worst part of the job: “the unsociable hours,” says ryan. “an experienced presenter like me generally has to work weekends, bank holidays and very late evenings, plus, occasionally, a 5am shift.”job satisfaction: “i love the rush of live presenting and having to think on my feet every second,” says ryan. “i also get an adrenaline rush from knowing that, at times, i have thousands of viewers ordering the product that i have just been presenting.”
elementary	on one day in august, one in seven people on earth, 1 billion people, used facebook, according to founder mark zuckerberg. in ten years, the social network has changed peopleõs relationships, privacy, their businesses, news media, helped to end unfair governments and even changed the meaning of common words. òa more open and connected world is a better world,ó wrote zuckerberg. these are just some of the ways his company changed everything ð for better or worse.1 facebook has changed the de nition of òfriendó òto friendó is now a verb. in real life, it is dif cult to end a friendship but, on facebook, it is easy to òunfriendó someone. òto unfriendó is a word invented to describe ending contact with a facebook friend.the meanings of the words òshareó and òlikeó are the same but facebook has made the words more important to us.school and university reunions are unnecessary ð you already know whose job is going well and youõve seen pictures of your schoolfriendsõ babies. you wonõt be surprised if you see an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyõre with someone else because youõve seen the romantic sel es.in real life, some friends are more important than others but, on facebook, all friends have the same importance. a classmate from university who you havenõt seen for 15 years, a friend-of-a-friend from a party or a colleague youõve never spoken to ð they are all facebook friends in the same way as your best friend, or your husband or wife, or your mum.it doesnõt mean we see them the same way. professor robin dunbar is famous for his research that says a person can only have about 150 people in their social group. facebook hasnõt changed that yet, he believes. but dunbar says he fears it is so easy to end friendships on facebook that, one day, people may not need to learn to get on with each other.2 we care less about privacy most young people are happy to give facebook their personal details. ninety-one per cent post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.more than 80% list their interests, which allows companies to try to sell things to them. but most young users limit who can see their pro les ð 60% allow friends only. 3 facebook has created millions of jobs ð but not in its own of ces michael tinmouth has worked with companies such as vodafone and microsoft. he says, òthanks to facebook, companies have a better understanding of their customers than ever before. the data available is extraordinary. you know who your customers are and who they are friends with and what they think about your company.óand advertisers pay a lot for that. facebook earned $3.32 billion from advertising.facebook can also be dangerous for companies. suddenly, customers donõt simply complain on the phone or on a small internet forum ð angry customers can post their complaints for hundreds of their friends to see or even on the companyõs own page.4 facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions organizing demonstrations has been revolutionized by facebook. manchester universityõs olga onuch found that half of all the euromaidan protesters in ukraine had got their information from facebook.many people told onuch that they needed facebook to read the truth about what was happening ð they donõt trust traditional media.5 facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news about 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 63% of all users say they get news from the internet. about a third of facebook users post about politics and government.most people will  rst read an item of news on facebook or other social media, mostly on mobiles.6 users are changing facebook it started as a site for students of top us universities.in 2014, ten years after facebook started, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a facebook account. and 39% are connected to people they have never met.more than ever, the site is a gateway not just to your friends but to the rest of the internet.david kirkpatrick, author of the facebook effect, said that we need to get used to it. he said that facebook might go away one day but it is very big so it will take a long time to disappear.nannannannannannannan
advanced	the small space is set up to look like a classroom. its corrugated iron walls are hung with educational charts – illustrated letters of the alphabet and a map of bangladesh.but, the constant sound of hammering and the chemicals in the air that catch in the back of the throat and irritate the eyes make it hard to concentrate. the children who learn in this three-square-metre room are the lucky ones, however. they have escaped working in the factories opposite.for 14 years, sohay, a grassroots nongovernmental organization (ngo) funded by the global fund for children and comic relief, has been working in slum areas of dhaka to get child labourers into school. it focuses on children working in hazardous conditions – in aluminium and plastic factories, and tanneries.the classroom is one of 23 urban development centres that sohay has set up across the capital. the centres prepare children for primary school with classes that help them catch up on their education. once they are in primary school, the children can do homework at the centres, with help from their peers.alamin, ten, who used to work in a plastic factory, attends one of the centres. his father is a street seller and his mother a part-time domestic worker. they are all happy that he’s now in school and away from hazardous work. his friend rabi says he wants to forget his past in the factory. “i like school,” he says.“the urban development centres aim to create an education-friendly environment in the communities and change their cultural mindset towards the children,” says sohay’s programme manager, mohammed abdullah al-mamun. sohay also runs sessions for parents and employers to discourage child labour and offers skills training to increase family income.“getting working children into formal education is really very challenging,” says mamun. “their psychological and physical condition is not like other children in society. after they leave work, they sometimes find it difficult to make friends and adapt to school. it is also very challenging to ensure they stay in school – the dropout rate is very high for these children. in this context, it’s important to work with schools so they have more sensitivity and care about them.”seven-year-old zhorna akter sumayya has two older brothers, both of whom are in work (one at a restaurant, one at a local club). but, after being introduced to education at one of sohay’s centres, she now goes to a state primary school. her family live in the slum and her parents can’t survive without the income their sons bring home. her father works in a rickshaw garage and her mother is a domestic worker, but they were keen for their daughter to go to school.in 2015, sohay helped 1,540 children to leave hazardous work and 2,125 vulnerable children – those in danger of entering work – into school. about 780 more children are preparing to enter school in 2017. the organization is also helping 635 children who are working in hazardous conditions to know their rights under bangladesh’s 2010 child labour elimination code of conduct. the policy aimed to eradicate all forms of child labour by 2015 but that target was missed.the labour law of bangladesh 2006 bans children under the age of 14 from working but, according to the un children’s agency, unicef, 4.7 million children under that age are employed in the informal sector and 1.3 million aged five to 17 work in hazardous industries.“it was difficult to get them into school without any compensation for their time,” says sadia nasrin, who runs sonjag, another dhaka grassroots ngo. “to overcome this challenge, sonjag started working closely with the community in the slums where the children live.”the organization talked to community members about why it was important to get children into school. they selected community volunteers who were motivated to change children’s lives and formed groups with social workers, community leaders, mothers, young volunteers and the local government.“the groups play a vital role in motivating employers to let children leave for two to three hours a day to attend school and to ensure a safe workplace for the children. the ultimate change-makers are the community people,” says nasrin.she adds that people living in slums face threats of eviction, police raids and displacement. “the national plan of action for children does not recognize the needs of street children,” says nasrin. “legislative measures are limited.”when the children have missed starting school at five years old, it is a race against time to prevent them from growing up without an education. “after they cross their school age, it is really very difficult to admit them into school,” says mamun. “children are just passing their time without education and waiting to become involved in hazardous work. we are working to block the child labour flow.”
elementary	the view from the visitors centre in the donana national park in southern spain is a bird- watchers dream: 200,000 hectares of wetlands vital for the birds of western europe. many of britains most loved migratory birds rest here every year on their migrations from africa. donana is also home to some of europes rarest birds, including the spanish imperial eagle.it is a beautiful landscape but it is under threat. in 1998, almost two billion gallons of toxic water, full of acid and waste metals, poured into the park from the los frailes mine 45km away. they collected more than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh afterwards and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed.it was spains worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost ¬90 million. spain realized that donana is the nations most important natural site, so the country decided to spend an extra ¬360 million on restoring the landscape to its original wetland state. it has been an expensive process. and donana is still under threat from the pressures of modern life. there are plans to build an oil pipeline through donana and there is also an idea to build new hotels and golf courses, which would use a lot of local water. sand and soil washed from nearby farms is also blocking the channels that cross the park.but, the biggest shock has been the recent decision of the andalucian government to reopen the frailes mine that nearly destroyed donana in 1998. this is europes most important bird sanctuary, says laurence rose of the rspb (royal society for the protection of birds). donana already faces a lot of threats but now they want to bring back the cause of the disaster 16 years ago. it is extremely worrying.if you look at the state of the local economy, you quickly see why the government has made this decision. the crash of spains banks in 2008 had a very bad effect on the region. unemployment in some parts of andalucia is now more than 30%. if they reopen the mine, it would create more than 1,000 jobs.there are riches here, riches that the local inhabitants badly need, said energy spokesman vicente fernandez guerrero. we think mining is a good way to make it possible to allow local people to continue to live in the area. this is a mining area. people have mined metals here since roman times.fernandez said that the mine licence would only allow modern mining techniques, which do not create poisonous wet waste. they will use the best technology in the world here, fernandez said. they will not use liquid. we will not allow that.some people agree with the idea, but a lot of people disagree with it. carlos davila, who works for the spanish ornithological society in donana, was also alarmed at the idea. this is a very, very bad idea, he said. they say the new mine will be safe, but they said it was safe in 1998 and look what happened. we got the worst ecological disaster in the history of spain.almost every visitor at a local restaurant had a camera and telescopic lens or a pair of binoculars. lots of tourists come to don_ana because of the birdlife. this is not surprising for this is a truly special place. a big sky hangs over this  at but dramatic landscape. birds of every shape and size  ll the air and sometimes the road. at one point on my visit, a stork calmly stood in front of our car until it felt ready to  y off.the trouble is that spain does not have the public resources it had 16 years ago. a repeat of the disaster today would have a much, much more damaging impact, said rose. davila agrees. after the disaster, spain realized that it had a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it, he added. now, it seems we have forgotten that lesson. it is very depressing.nan

intermediate	seaworld has suffered an 84% collapse in pro ts ð customers have deserted the controversial aquatic theme park company because of claims that it mistreated orca whales.the company trains dolphins and killer whales to perform tricks in front of stadiums full of people. they have suffered declines in attendance, sales and pro ts because people think they donõt treat their animals well.seaworld has been in the news since the 2013 documentary black sh said that its treatment of orca whales made the whales act violently and that this caused the deaths of three people. after the documentary was shown, attendance collapsed and the company lost more than half of its market value on wall street. its former ceo also had to leave the company.animal rights activists say that orcas kept in tanks die at a younger age than wild whales. seaworld started a marketing campaign to show that this isnõt true.it cut ticket prices and spent $10m on marketing but seaworld ceo joel manby had to admit that the company is still struggling to convince the public that it treats its whales well.òwe realize we have much work ahead of us,ó manby said. talking about the companyõs reputation, he said, òearly feedback on our campaign has been positive. however, we recognize that solving our image problems in california will be challenging.óòwe will continue to  ght with the facts because the facts are on our side,ó he said.manby, who joined the company as ceo in 2015 to help the company recover, said he would give a presentation on his vision for the future of the company at a special event on 6 november.there are already plans for a new shark exhibition in orlando and an attraction in san antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a ònaturalisticó setting.the companyõs  nancial report, released on 6 august, showed pro ts in the second quarter dropped from $37.4m in 2014 to $5.8m in 2015. this is an 84% decrease. revenue fell from $405m to $392m. attendance dropped by more than 100,000 from 6.58 million to 6.48 million.analysts will now be closely watching seaworldõs sales and attendance numbers in the third quarter, which is traditionally the companyõs most pro table and covers the summer holiday season. attendance may suffer from a fresh scandal in july 2015 ð it was alleged that a seaworld employee had in ltrated animal rights protest groups against the company.jared goodman, director of animal law for people for the ethical treatment of animals (peta), said: òseaworld has a spying scandal, animals are dying in its tanks and tens of thousands of people are against its plan to build a new orca prison. families just donõt want to buy tickets to see orcas going insane inside tiny tanks. seaworldõs orcas wonõt recover and seaworldõs pro ts wonõt recover either until it empties its tanks and builds sanctuaries by the coast.óseaworldõs shares, which were worth $39 in 2013, fell to just under $18 in august 2015.
elementary	according to a recent scienti c study, organic food has more healthy antioxidants than regular food. it also has fewer toxic metals and pesticides. the international team that did the study suggests that changing to organic fruit and vegetables could be as healthy as adding one or two portions of the recommended ô ve a dayõ fruit and vegetables.the team, led by professor carlo leifert, concludes that there are big differences between organic and non-organic food. organic food has between 19% and 69% more antioxidants. it is the  rst study to show clear differences between organic and regular fruits, vegetables and cereals.the researchers say that the higher levels of antioxidants have the same effect as òone to two of the  ve portions of fruits and vegetables that people should eat every dayó. they say this means that organic food is better for our health.the  ndings will make people argue even more about whether or not organic food is better for people. tom sanders, a professor of nutrition at kingõs college london, said the research showed some differences. òbut are the differences relevant? i am not sure.ó he also said that research showed organic cereals have less protein than regular crops.the results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 studies from around the world ð more than ever before ð which examine differences between organic and regular fruit, vegetables and cereals. helen browning, who supports organic farming, said that the research showed that how we farm affects the quality of the food we eat.leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants reduce the risk of serious diseases, including diseases of the heart and certain cancers. the researchers also found much higher levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, in regular crops. they found four times more pesticides on regular crops than on organic food.people will criticize the research: including so many studies in the analysis could make the results unreliable. also, the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in regular food are still below recommended limits. but, the researchers say that cadmium stays in the body and that some people may want to avoid this. they also say that recommended limits are for single pesticides and not for the mixture of chemicals that farmers use on regular crops.another criticism of the research is that the differences it found may be the result of different climates, different types of soil and different types of crops; they may not be the result of organic farming. but, the biggest criticism will be about possible health bene ts. the most recent major analysis, which included 223 studies in 2012, found little evidence of health bene ts. òother studies did not  nd evidence that organic foods are much more nutritious than regular foods,ó it found.sanders agrees. òyou are not going to be healthier if you eat organic food,ó he said. òwhat is most important is what you eat, not whether itõs organic or regular. itõs whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all.óshoppers say that healthy eating (55%) and avoiding chemicals (53%) are the main reasons they buy organic food. browning said: òthis research supports what people think about organic food. in other countries, there is much more support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming. we hope that now the uk will accept organic food like people in the rest of europe.nan
intermediate	all six numbers match, so it’s time to buy that audi, book the holiday in the us and phone the estate agent. at least, that’s what most lottery millionaires do, according to a study of spending and investment by jackpot winners.since it started in 1994, the uk national lottery has created 3,000 millionaires who have won more than £8.5bn in total, at an average of £2.8m each. between them, they have created a further 3,780 millionaires among their children, family and friends, according to the authors of the study, oxford economics.most winners (59%) give up work straight away, but 19% carry on working and 31% do unpaid voluntary work. the good news for the economy is that 98% of the money the winners spent remained in the uk. through their spending on property, vehicles and holidays, it is estimated that each winner keeps six people in a full-time job for a year.winners have contributed almost £750m to gross domestic product (gdp), and generated more than £500m in tax for the exchequer. the bulk of the money went on property, with £2.72bn spent on winners’ main properties, and £170m in paying off existing debt and mortgages.£2.125bn was spent on investments. gifts to family and friends accounted for £1.17bn, and £680m was spent on cars and holidays.the study was based on research from 100 £1m-plus winners. it found that in total the 3,000 winners have purchased 7,958 houses or flats in the uk, or 2.7 each, spending £3.3bn. most winners (82%) changed their main home, spending an average £900,000.the new home is likely to have a hot tub, with almost a third (29%) putting that on their shopping list. a walk-in wardrobe was absolutely necessary for 28%, almost a quarter (24%) chose a property behind electric gates, and 22% had a games room, with 7% installing a snooker table.larger properties need maintaining, and 30% of winners employed a cleaner and 24% a gardener. a small proportion (5%) employed a beautician.audis were the favourite cars of 16% of winners, with range rovers and bmws also popular purchases (11% each), as well as mercedes (10%) and land rovers (5%). winners spent £463m on 17,190 cars, with the average price of their favourite being £46,116.holidays were also a priority. the majority (68%) choose five-star hotels overseas. the us was the favoured destination for 27%, followed by the caribbean (9%). closer to home, however, uk caravan sales have benefited. over the past 18 years, 10% of millionaires have bought a caravan, generating sales worth about £7.4m.some winners (15%) have started their own businesses, 9% have helped others to do so, and 6% have invested in or bought other people’s businesses. businesses started or supported by lottery winners employ 3,195 people, according to the study.andy logan, author of the report, said: “the effect of a win spreads much further and wider than we expected. not only does it change the lives of friends and family, but each win has an effect on the uk economy, especially with so much of it being spent in the uk.”
elementary	we all know about wildlife emergencies such as the possible extinction of the tiger in india, the orangutan in indonesia and the panda. everybody loves these animals and no one wants to see them disappear. but, now, scientists are worried that the threat to creatures such as ladybirds is a much greater danger to biodiversity.climate change, falling numbers of animals, rising numbers of humans and extinction mean that more and more scientists now believe that we are in the anthropocene age – the age of extinction.a recent report from the world wildlife fund (wwf) confirms that worrying idea – statistics from the report show a very big reduction in the numbers of many species. the number of vertebrates has declined by 52% over the last forty years. we are losing too many species. some populations of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians have reduced even more, with freshwater species declining by 76% over the same period. but it’s the creatures that help us the most that are worrying many scientists. three quarters of the world’s food production depends on bees and other insects. pandas are cute and tigers are beautiful but other animals are more useful – it’s worms that turn our waste into nutrients and bats that catch mosquitoes and keep malaria rates down.“it’s the loss of the common species that will affect people. the loss of the rarer creatures will not affect us much because we’re not reliant on them in such an obvious way,” said dr nick isaac, who studies the environment. he says that britain’s insects and other invertebrates are declining just as fast as vertebrates. he says that this will cause serious problems for humans.he said that between 23% and 36% of all birds, mammals and amphibians that we use for food or medicine might become extinct. in many parts of the world, wild animals are an important part of the diet, particularly for the poor.most people also blame humans – humans damage ecosystems, create climate change and destroy habitats. but, this time, it’s not just the “big, cuddly mammals” we have to worry about losing but the smaller creatures that are less easy to see. we depend on insects, creepy-crawlies and even worms. they might not become extinct very soon, but a decline in their numbers will affect us all. “we are going to feel the effect of those losses. the numbers of both invertebrates and vertebrates are declining. it’s not so simple as ‘fish die and people starve’ – it’s more complex,” said isaac.humans, said tv naturalist sir david attenborough in 2013, are a “plague on earth”. but the wwf claims there is still time to stop the decline. its uk chief executive david nussbaum said: “the amount of destruction shown in this report should make us all change our behaviour. we all – politicians, business and people – have a responsibility to protect what we all value: a healthy future for people and nature.“humans are cutting down too many trees too quickly, fishing too many fish, taking too much water from our rivers and producing too much carbon,” he said.
advanced	he arrived – in his own words, in 2005 – as “a simple, humble worker in god’s vineyard”. and on a grey, cold, blustery monday in february, pope benedict xvi signed off in the same fashion: like an elderly labourer who can no longer ignore the pains in his back; who can no more count on the strength of his arms. characteristically for this most traditionally minded of pontiffs, he made his excuses in latin. the first german pope in modern times timed his departure to the minute. “from 28 february 2013, at 20.00 hours”, he told a gathering of cardinals in the vatican, “the see of rome, the see of saint peter, will be vacant and a conclave to elect the new supreme pontiff will have to be convoked by those whose competence it is.”among those present was a mexican prelate, monsignor oscar sanchéz barba, from guadalajara. he was in rome to be told the date for a canonization in which he has played a leading role. “we were all in the sala del concistoro in the third loggia of the apostolic palace,” he said. “after giving the date for the canonization, the twelfth of may, the pope took a sheet of paper and read from it.“we were all left …” – sanchéz barba looked around him in the bernini colonnade that embraces st peter’s square, grasping for the word, as speechless as the “princes of the church” who had just heard the man they believe to be god’s representative on earth give up on the job. “the cardinals were just looking at one another,” sanchéz barba said.angelo sodano, the dean of the college of cardinals, who must have been forewarned, delivered a brief and perhaps hurriedly composed speech. before going on to assure the pope of the cardinals’ loyalty and devotion, he said he and the others present had “listened to you with a sense of bewilderment, almost completely incredulous”. at the end of his address, the pope blessed those present, and left. “it was so simple; the simplest thing imaginable,” said sanchéz barba. “then we all left in silence. there was absolute silence … and sadness.”john thavis, who spent 30 years reporting on the holy see and whose book, the vatican diaries, is soon to be published, said he had had an intuition the pope might be about to resign and timed his return to rome from the us accordingly. a fellow-vatican watcher confirmed this to be the case. thavis noted that in the book-length interview benedict gave to a german journalist, published as light of the world in 2010, he had made it clear he considered it would be right to go if he felt he were no longer up to the job. “i asked myself: if i were pope and wanted to resign, when would i choose? he has completed his series of books and most of his projects are off the ground. what is more, there were no dates in his calendar of events he personally had to attend. i thought the most likely date was 22 february, which is the feast of the chair of st peter. so i got it wrong.”the line emerging from the vatican within hours of the announcement was that the pope’s decision was a brave one. by this account, benedict – never one to shrink from utterances and decisions that shocked – had taken it upon himself to bring his church face to face with reality: the reality that contemporary medicine can keep men alive far beyond the age at which they are up to grappling with the demands of running a vast global organization. thavis agreed: “what i find particularly courageous is that he is prepared to say now, when he is not sick, that he is going; and that he’s doing it because he’s tired and not because he’s particularly ill.” but is that the whole story? does he know more about his state of health than the vatican has so far made public?benedict’s own account of his reasons makes it clear that he took into account not only his physical, but also his psychological condition: “in order to govern the bark of saint peter and proclaim the gospel, both strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that i have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me.” other theories will no doubt swirl around the vatican in the days and weeks ahead, just as they did following the death of pope john paul i in 1978, 33 days after his election. already there is speculation that something was about to come out about benedict’s past. the vatican will just as predictably dismiss such notions with contempt. but they are understandable all the same, for the transcendental importance of what benedict has done cannot be overstated.emerging from st peter’s basilica, julia rochester, from london, who described herself as a lapsed catholic, was still turning over the implications of the pope’s resignation. “if you’re god’s chosen one, how do you choose not be chosen?” she mused. it is a question many practising catholics will be asking of their priests in the weeks ahead. in his first speech as pope – humbly disclaiming his fitness for the task – benedict said: “i am consoled by the fact that the lord knows how to work and how to act, even with insufficient tools.” at some point in the last eight years, it would seem, he ceased to believe that was true.
advanced	back in 2010, the old city in srinagar was the sort of place police would only venture into wearing body armour. a stronghold for violent separatists agitating for an independent kashmir, it was at the centre of uprisings that left more than 100 people dead, buried along with dreams of peace in the mountainous north-indian region.how quickly things change. now carefree tourists line up in the same streets for barbecued mutton tikka and steaming plates of rogan josh. the nowhatta mosque, where in the summer of 2010 youths would gather after friday prayers to throw stones at the security forces, is to become part of an official walking tour focused on heritage, crafts and markets. down by dal lake, houseboats have been booked out months in advance. in the stunning gardens lining the lake’s green slopes, visitors can have their picture taken against one of asia’s prettiest backdrops. until the snow melted, the nearby ski resorts were packed with rich russians, too.in 2002, only just over 27,000 tourists dared to visit the kashmir valley, frightened off by the anti-indian insurgency, which has claimed up to 70,000 lives. so far in 2012, the area has received almost one million holidaymakers – more than 23,000 of them from outside india. but fewer than 150 britons were among them – largely because the uk’s foreign office refuses to amend its somewhat hair-raising advice, which deters most travellers by providing a list of recent security incidents in the region.omar abdullah, the uk-born chief minister of jammu and kashmir, has lobbied the british high commission in delhi to relax the guidelines, but to no avail. “it’s a source of frustration,” admitted abdullah, who has been in charge of india’s most sensitive state since the start of 2009. “today, unfortunately, as a result of that travel advisory, people’s insurance is null and void when they visit here.” the last publicized case of foreign tourists being murdered in j&k was in 1995, when six westerners including two britons were kidnapped by al-faran, a kashmiri militant islamist group. only one escaped with his life.“you’ve had british citizens killed more recently in countries that you still haven’t stopped people from visiting. i mean, how many british citizens did you lose in 9/11? did you stop people from visiting new york? you’ve lost them in spain, in bali; tell me where you haven’t lost them,” said abdullah. “we’ve lost indians in london. there is still a possibility that al-qaida could do something stupid like they have done in the past, but we haven’t stopped indians from travelling to london. there is no reason to single out jammu and kashmir, or even srinagar, as an unsafe destination.”germany relaxed its guidelines for those thinking of travelling to the region in 2011. “foreigners are generally not direct targets of clashes,” counselled germany’s amended advice. at the time, it was viewed by many outsiders as a bold move, coming less than a year after the 2010 disturbances finally died down. a nationwide holiday on 15 august marked 65 years of indian independence – in the past, a day fraught with peril in a state where many do not feel part of the world’s biggest democracy. but this time at the independence celebrations there was no trouble.abdullah insists tourists are safe in the state, “as long as you take the sort of precautions that one normally would”. in other words, do not go trekking near the border that separates the indian and pakistani controlled parts of j&k. syed ali shah geelani, leader of the pro-kashmiri independence party, disagrees bitterly with much of abdullah’s politics. but on the issue of tourism, the two are united. at the start of the summer season, geelani wrote an open letter to tourists and pilgrims that said: “whatever your faith, whatever language you speak and to whatever region you belong, we are bound by a common bond, the bond of humanity. you are our honoured guest – respecting and protecting guests is not only our moral obligation but an article of faith.”some visitors may worry about the ethics of having fun in a place with a population suffering from record levels of anxiety and mental health problems. but all the locals we spoke to in srinagar were wholeheartedly in favour of tourism. amjid gulzar, 26, said abdullah could search for truth and reconciliation as well as encouraging foreign visitors. “he must do both; but without tourism, our economy will be in chaos,” he said, adding that while he welcomed the million tourists who visited this year, kashmir had to do more to attract big-spending visitors, especially foreigners.“we need better infrastructure, better roads, reliable electricity. we need more for tourists to do in the evening – we don’t even have one cinema in this city and there isn’t enough for tourists to do after dark,” he said. but will tourists feel welcome? in june, a local islamic group issued a “dress code” for foreign tourists. abdullah sighs at the mention of that furore. “nobody expects tourists to come here and cover their faces. i think what they were talking about was short shorts and sleeveless vests, which even then would not be something that would attract too much attention … i think the basic point they were making was: be sensitive to our cultural identity and dress appropriately. i think that’s common sense.”abdullah said he was on a tourism drive “for no other reason than the fact that i need to stimulate the economy”. j&k’s finances are in a dire state after more than two decades of turmoil. the state receives just £72m each year in taxes, and yet the salary bill for the 500,000 public employees is £155m, he said. it is clear why he needs to find more funds, fast. for now, though, he is just cautiously pleased to see tourists back. “i’m not suggesting that because we’ve had one million tourists here that it’s a sign of normality,” he said. “but it gives me some satisfaction that people can come, have a nice time, and go back.”

world, with the exception of countries such as lesotho, which have been hit by hiv and violence, lifespans are lengthening and the best news is that small children are substantially less likely to die than they were four decades ago. there has been a drop in deaths among under-fives of nearly 60%, from 16.4 million in 1970 to 6.8 million in 2010.that in itself is justification for the enormous project that the institute of health metrics and evaluation (ihme) in seattle has led over the past five years, involving nearly 500 researchers, to assess the global burden of disease. knowing how many children die and from what cause enables the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive. there are many lessons to be gleaned from the vast database they have put together, which will help global organizations and individual governments to better care for us all – from a renewed focus on diet to tackling alcohol to keeping up the efforts against hiv in africa.the seven papers published by the lancet represent a big undertaking and are not without controversy. ihme has been ambitiously radical in some of its methods. in the absence of death registries or medical records, they have been willing, for instance, to take evidence from verbal autopsies – deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family. the most startling result has been the malaria figure, released earlier in 2012. ihme said 1.2 million die of the disease every year – twice as many as previously thought. the big increase is in adult deaths. conventional wisdom has it that malaria kills mostly children under five.“the way i was taught as a doctor and everybody else is taught is that, in malarial areas, you become semi-immune as an adult,” said dr christopher murray, ihme director and one of the founders of the global burden of disease project. “we originally went with the prevailing opinion but there has been a shift as we have become more empirical. african doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot.” but, he adds, their fever could be something else. the findings have prompted further studies.although margaret chan, director general of the world health organization, gave the ihme study a warm official welcome, some of the staff are cautious. “we need to be very careful in assessing the validity [of the figures],” said colin mathers, a senior scientist in the evidence for information and policy cluster. “we need to wait to be persuaded by evidence.” his colleague dr tiers boerma, director of the who department of health statistics and informatics, added: “people should understand that some of the numbers are very different and the who can’t jump with any academic publication that states a different number.” however, said mathers, “the fact that ihme has pushed the envelope with some of these analyses is stimulating”. one of the main themes, said murray, was “incredibly rapid change in the leading causes of death and the pace of that change is a lot faster than we expected it to be”.reduced fertility and longer life expectancies have meant a rise in the mean age of the world’s population in a decade, from 26 years old to almost 30. it has been dramatic in latin america, for instance, where countries like brazil and paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010. that is a 35-year increase in the mean age of death over four decades. “in a place like brazil, the speed of change is so fast that most institutions are ill-equipped to deal with it,” murray said.the second theme, entwined with it, is the shift outside africa from communicable diseases and the common causes of mother and baby deaths to what are sometimes termed “lifestyle” diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer – some of which have significant genetic triggers. that shift has been particularly marked in latin america, the middle east and south-east and even south asia, he said.the third big finding was, murray said, “a surprise to us”. that was the sheer extent of disability and the toll it took on people who were living longer but not healthier lives. “the main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you,” he said. they were mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, musculoskeletal disorders such as arthritis and lower back pain – complained of in every country in the world – anaemia, sight and hearing loss and skin disease. in addition, there was substance abuse. “the rates for these are not going down over time,” he said. “we are making no progress in reducing these conditions.”
intermediate	the forests – and suburbs – of europe are echoing with the growls and howls of large predators according to a new study. the study shows that brown bears, wolves and lynx are thriving on the crowded continent. rising human populations and overconsumption make many people believe that such animals will soon become extinct. but the study has found that large-predator populations are stable or rising in europe.brown bears, wolves and the eurasian lynx are found in nearly one-third of mainland europe (excluding belarus, ukraine and russia), with most living outside nature reserves. this indicates that changing attitudes and conservation measures are successfully protecting species that have suffered massive persecution throughout human history.bears are the most abundant large carnivore in europe – there are around 17,000 of them. there are 12,000 wolves and 9,000 eurasian lynx. only belgium, denmark, the netherlands and luxembourg in mainland europe – like britain – have no breeding populations of at least one large carnivore species. but the study’s main author and other conservationists said that these animals now live in well-populated regions of europe, so even the british countryside could support big predators.guillaume chapron from sweden’s university of agricultural sciences and researchers across europe found wolves, in some cases, living in suburban areas alongside up to 3,050 people per square kilometre. on average in europe, wolves live on land with a population density of 37 people per sq km, lynx in areas with a population density of 21 people per sq km and bears among 19 people per sq km. the population density of the scottish highlands is just nine people per sq km.“in order to have wolves, we don’t need to remove people from the landscape,” said chapron. he adds that the big-carnivore revival shows the success of a “land-sharing” model of conservation – unlike the policy of keeping predators and people apart by fencing off “wilderness” areas, as occurs in north america and africa.“i’m not saying it’s a peace-and-love story – coexistence often means conflict – but it’s important to manage that conflict and resolve the problems it causes. wolves can be difficult neighbours,” said chapron. “we shouldn’t be talking about people-predator conflict; we have conflict between people about predators. these animals are symbolic of difficult questions about how we should use the land.”according to the researchers, this “land-sharing” approach could be applied elsewhere in the world. the reasons for its success in europe include political stability, growing populations of prey species such as wild deer, and financial support for nonlethal livestock protection such as electric fences, which mean that farmers do not have to shoot wild predators. most crucial, said chapron, has been the eu habitats directive, which has forced member states to protect and revive rare species.“without the habitats directive, i don’t think we would have had this recovery,” he said. “it shows that, if people are willing to protect nature and if politicians introduce strong legislation, it’s possible to achieve results in wildlife protection.” the revival was welcomed by author george monbiot, who is launching rewilding britain, a new charity to encourage the return of wild landscape and extinct species.“it is great to see this trend continuing but britain is completely anomalous – we’ve lost more of our large mammals than any country except for ireland,” he said. “apart from the accidental reintroduction of wild boar, we’ve done almost nothing, whereas in much of the rest of europe we’ve got bears, lynx and wolves coming back.”the survey found that the eurasian lynx lives permanently in 11 population groups in 23 european countries and only five of these were native populations. this indicates the success of reintroduction efforts. according to monbiot, support for the reintroduction of the lynx into the scottish mountains is growing.“if it works in the rest of europe, there’s absolutely no reason why it can’t work in the uk,” he said. he points out that bears and wolves live within an hour of rome. “there’s no reason why we can’t have a similar return of wildlife in the uk.”
elementary	in 2005, blackberry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone and the company was just entering its period of success. then, the iphone was still just an idea and blackberry’s innovations made its smartphone one of canada’s biggest exports.six years later, in the summer of 2011, there were riots in london and other uk cities. rioters used blackberry messenger (bbm) and politicians wanted the service to shut down. but, two years later, the users themselves are leaving bbm.fewer and fewer people want blackberry phones. there are now many alternative products, from facebook’s and apple’s instant messaging applications to independent apps such as whatsapp and kik (which is also canadian). they are free to download and use, and they use the internet to swap text messages, pictures, voice clips, ‘stickers’ and even videos between most types of phones.bbm is trying to keep its customers and you can now use it on android and apple phones. there are many other apps people can use, but lots of people want to use the bbm app – more than 20 million people downloaded it. but many people believe bbm will not survive. “the move to bring blackberry to the iphone is four or five years too late,” says james gooderson, a technology blogger. “whatsapp has made blackberrys unnecessary for young people.”bbm says it has 80 million monthly users after its upgrade, but whatsapp has 300 million. other services show bbm’s weaknesses: skype and viber have video or voice calls, but bbm doesn’t; path does location sharing, but bbm doesn’t; there is no video sharing, as on imessage; and the stickers (a more sophisticated version of the smiley face), that kids around the world adore, are also absent. even the contacts and calendar sharing that bbm made possible on blackberry phones are not on the apple and android versions.messaging is now becoming visual. photos that are uploaded to instagram get instant comments and snapchat’s pictures have opened a world of other possibilities. like bbm, all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection. but, in 2011, bbm was so powerful that it helped to start a revolution in egypt; and at the time of the london riots, people used bbm, not their televisions, to find out quickly what was happening.nearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application but two-thirds use more than one. 60% of 16- to 24-year-olds use facebook every day, but 46% use alternatives. “it’s much more complex,” says benedict evans, a digital media specialist. “all of these apps use your smartphone. apps rise and fall like fireworks. some, like instagram, last; others just disappear.”thirteen-year-old bennett has three phones. he keeps his blackberry for messaging, he uses an iphone to play games, and he makes phone calls on an android phone. his friends are still on bbm. at the touch of a few buttons, you can send a single blackberry message to several hundred people; on whatsapp, the limit is 50. but, for bennett, instagram is now a major social network. “instagram is facebook without parents,” he says. “facebook is now for older people.”the low cost of buying and using a blackberry is still an advantage. anyone with a second-hand phone and a £7-a-month deal from a telecoms company can use unlimited bbm messages. but people no longer trust the privacy of bbm. business people, revolutionaries, demonstrators and rioters used to believe that their messages were secret. the arrests that followed the riots showed that wasn’t true.in the rich london district of south kensington, the older pupils at one school all have apple phones. they all use whatsapp. for many, bbm is a distant memory. “i still have a blackberry, but i’m the only one,” says one teenager. and how does that make him feel? “isolated,” he says.nan
intermediate	there are worse things to do in life than stroll along rioõs copacabana beach in the sunshine on the way to watch a world cup match, so it was perhaps not surprising that england fan anthony mcdowell from liverpool was in a good mood. òthe place is lovely. the people are great. thereõs a party atmosphere,ó said mcdowell. òthe only thing that could be better is the england team.óhe and half a dozen friends are among the thousands of supporters from around the world who have made the beach into a party zone of national colours and chants. some danced, some posed for photos, some drank, but mostly they just walked and talked football, waiting for the next game to begin on the nearby big screen. the last time there were so many people here during the daytime, the pope was visiting.the cheerful, largely peaceful mood was very different from the protests, transport chaos and stadium problems during the preparations for the world cup. but, now the football is under way, visiting supporters are determined to enjoy the experience. òif i had known, when i started planning, how complicated and costly it would be, i wouldnõt have come. but, now that weõre here, itõs great,ó said brian hill, an england fan from sunderland.the trip has not been without its problems. hill travelled for more than 20 hours to get to rio. his son, andrew, had his sunglasses stolen almost as soon as he sat on the beach. and, they have been surprised that many bars do not have big screens for the games. but, like many fans, they said they loved the atmosphere of this tournament, which has got off to a spectacular start on the pitch.everyone must have been thrilled by robin van persieõs extraordinary diving header for the netherlands against spain. and, there have been lots of goals: 28 in the  rst eight games ð almost three times as many as at the same stage in south africa in 2010. adding to the carnival mood on the streets, where the majority of fans are from neighbouring nations, latin-american teams have been very successful so far.up to now, the tournament has avoided the worst doomsday scenarios, though it is far from trouble free. the stadiums may have been delivered late and ð in some cases ð not fully  nished, but there have been no reports of structural problems or dif culties entering the grounds since the kick off.as at previous world cups, ticketing has been a problem, with many empty seats at several games. fifa spokesman saint-clair milesi con rmed that only 48,000 of the 51,900 seats at the netherlands versus spain game were filled.the globo newspaper listed a number of problems in the 12 host cities. almost all suffered worse traf c congestion than usual. the worst transport problems were in natal, where bus drivers were on strike. in salvador, some journey times were  ve times longer than usual. òtraf c was already bad but this week it is chaotic,ó said jecilda mello, a local resident. but, protests have diminished since the opening day, when small demonstrations took place in several cities and police used tear gas and pepper spray. since then, the only security threat has been petty theft and overexcited fans. a spontaneous street party of argentinian fans was dispersed with pepper spray after the fans blocked roads.the huge distances have led to some very different world cup experiences. the tournament has made only a small mark on sa_o paulo, south americaõs most populous city, but far away in manaus ð the remote amazonian city where england played italy ð visitors said there was world cup fever with brightly decorated streets and  ags on many cars.the fa chairman, greg dyke, said there was a big difference in atmosphere. weve had a really warm welcome in manaus. its a big thing for them, even if it is a bit strange to spend so much on a stadium with no one to play in it. but we were in sao paulo for four or  ve days before the opening match and you wouldnt have known until the last day that there was even a world cup on. it was weird.
elementary	male bosses are paid bonuses double the size of bonuses given to female colleagues in the same jobs. this means that men get bonuses of £141,500 more than women over their working lives.the numbers, released by the chartered management institute (cmi), show that men in uk management jobs earned average bonuses of £6,442 in 2012 – compared with £3,029 for women.female directors received bonuses of £36,270 over the past 12 months, compared with £63,700 received by male directors.the numbers show that pay in british business is still not equal. campaigners believe we must do something to improve equality at work.ann francke, the cmi’s chief executive, said that there should be more flexibility and less masculine cultures, and that the good work people do should be more important than how much time they spend in the office. also, there should be more transparency around performance and bonuses.“if we solve this issue, we will improve the performance of organizations and the wellbeing of people at work,” she said. “what are we waiting for?”some of the numbers may be affected by women doing jobs where there is less of a culture of bonus payments. but the differences in the sizes of bonuses do make britain’s pay gap worse. the government says the pay gap is closing but that full-time male employees still earn 10% more than women.maria miller, the minister for women and equalities, said that the cmi numbers are another example from the world of work that shows that women still earn less than men doing the same job.“changes in the workplace are happening and it’s good that the pay gap is closing – but there is still more to do before we see full equality in the workplace.“the government is trying to help. 120 companies have joined our think, act, report scheme, which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit, promote and pay women.“we’ve also looked at other causes of the pay gap, such as having to juggle work and family.”large companies such as tesco, bt, unilever and the international law firm eversheds are some of the companies that have signed up to think, act, report. the scheme has only attracted 120 companies in nearly two years.but the cmi’s numbers also showed that the pay gap is closing: the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses appeared to be smaller than in 2012.nannannannannan
elementary	cathal redmond was swimming off the greek coast. he took some photos of colourful  sh with his  rst underwater camera and he was sure they would be great. but, when he looked at the photos later, they were brown and murky. the photos were bad because he was holding his breath underwater so he didnõt have enough time to take the pictures. he thought that all he needed was a little more time to photograph the  sh in their natural environment.to help with this problem, he has invented the express dive. it is a re llable air storage device, which you hold in your mouth. it lets you swim underwater for two minutes. it is somewhere between snorkelling, which is very limited, and scuba diving, which gives people the freedom to breathe underwater but needs heavy and expensive gear. the prototype of his invention looks like a combination of a scuba mouthpiece and a water bottle.òi wanted to let people to do more ð not just get underwater and spend 30 seconds holding their breath,ó says redmond, 27. in 2006, the irish designer completed a scuba-diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and watch  sh in their natural environment. but all the equipment he needed was less enjoyable.òi didnõt like that i had about 50kg of equipment on me. and getting into the water was quite strange when you are used to trying to stay at the surface. it was a very surreal experience,ó he says. òthe real problem is that scuba diving limits what you can do. it allows you to stay underwater for longer but it takes a lot of planning. you have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you ð you canõt just walk on the beach and decide you want to go in. planning is a very big part of it.óit was during a  nal-year project for his degree that redmond produced the express dive. the device has two main parts. when above the surface, the device takes in air through a vent in the mouthpiece. the air is compressed and stored in a tank, which has a light that  ashes green when it is full. when it has  nished taking in air, the vent closes and, when the person dives, air is fed back through the mouthpiece. the light turns from green to red when the air starts to runs out. the device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to re ll.redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to a snorkel. they have tested the prototype in parts. redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutes of air into the device and that a person can hold the device in their mouthwhat he has not yet done is test the device on a diver, completely underwater for two minutes. but, with enough testing, redmond is sure the device will work well and that it will not be dangerous for swimmers underwater. the device will probably cost £280, he says, and it will probably weigh from 1kg to 3kg.perhaps some people think two minutes of air is not enough and is not much better than snorkelling. but, redmond says two minutes can make all the difference underwater. the typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater. òtwo minutes is not a lot of time but it is a lot longer than that,ó he says.nannan
advanced	governments across europe dream of  nding a magic solution to rising unemployment. but, in the hardest-hit parts of the eu, joblessness rates continue to creep up and the rhetoric does little to shorten the dole queue.now, in a struggling corner of italy, one mayor thinks he has found an answer to his townõs chronic lack of work ð although, rather than a solution, it appears to some to be more of an admission of defeat. valter piscedda, the centre- left mayor of elmas, a small town near sardiniaõs capital, cagliari, wants to pay residents to leave. the council will pay for ten unemployed locals to take intensive english lessons, board a cheap  ight and look for jobs elsewhere in europe. òthis is, above all, an idea born of common sense and experience,ó he told the guardian. òover the past year and a half ð especially in the past few months ð i have been receiving young people, almost every day, who are despairing about their search for work. some are looking here and ask for a hand in  nding it here. others have tried everything and are so discouraged that they no longer want to stay and wait. and they want to go and gain work experience abroad; life experience, too.òso, my reasoning was this: put everything in place that the council administration can put in place so that those who want to gain experience abroad are able to,ó he said.as the national economy continues to falter, sardinia, along with much of southern and central italy, is grappling with high unemployment, with the overall joblessness rate at 17.7% in the second quarter of 2014, according to italyõs national institute of statistics, istat. more than 54% of people under 25 are out of work.for the adesso parto (now iõm leaving) programme, elmasõs council has allocated û12,000 on a  rst-come,  rst-served basis to applicants aged between 18 and 50. as long as they are out of work and have lived in the town for three years, they are eligible. they do not have to be university educated and their annual income must be no more than û15,000.the idea of encouraging people to up sticks is sensitive at a time when  oods of italians ð many of them bright young graduates ð are leaving their country every year. but piscedda, who belongs to the democratic party of the prime minister, matteo renzi, denies he is facilitating a brain drain and believes that the people he is sending away may well return òand give me back 100 times what they were givenó. more importantly, he wants the scheme to give a leg-up to those most in need.òitõs a programme for those with no other resource; itõs the last-chance saloon. itõs about allowing them the dignity of not having to ask a friend for money or place burdens on families that cannot do it,ó he said.earlier in 2014, he added, the council launched a scheme whereby businesses were given  nancial incentives to hire young workers from elmas. òwe advertised 20 of these positions,ó he said. òwe got 120 applications.ó in elmas, the scheme has provoked mixed reactions. òthe reality is that there is little work here,ó said alessandro macis. òthe opportunity to go abroad to learn about the workplace and experience other cultures can be very worthwhile. the son of a friend of mine who didnõt study much has ended up in london and heõs really  nding his way. he started as a waiter. now, heõs a cook and heõs learning english.ó others were perplexed. i heard about it but i thought it was strange. if you have that money to pay for people to go away, why dont you use that money to keep them here? said consuelo melis, who works behind the bar in a local cafe. on twitter, one of many reactions was disbelief. the states admission of defeat, commented marco patavino. institutions are raising the white  ag, remarked carlo mazzaggio.piscedda, however, is undeterred, remarking of his online critics: òprobably, they are people that arenõt in need ... every day, i deal with peopleõs problems and i have to do something to try to solve them. these people, if they had an alternative, they wouldnõt be asking for help.òthe work i can create, as mayor, is temporary. i can have a piazza cleaned. i can have it cleaned again. i can have the streets cleaned. but these are all temporary things that give nothing beyond that little bit of money for a few months. i want to go beyond that.ó
advanced	the balls have dropped down the chute and all six numbers match, so it’s time to buy that audi, book the holiday in the us and phone the estate agent. at least, that’s what most lottery millionaires do, according to an analysis of spending and investment by jackpot winners.since its launch in 1994, the lottery has created 3,000 millionaires who have won more than £8.5bn in total, at an average of £2.8m each. the trickle-down effect means that between them they have created a further 3,780 millionaires among their children, family and friends, according to the authors of the study, oxford economics.most winners (59%) give up work straight away, but 19% carry on doing the day job and 31% do unpaid voluntary work. the good news for the economy is that 98% of winners’ spending remained in the uk. through their spending on property, vehicles and holidays, it is estimated that each winner keeps six people in a full-time job for a year.winners have contributed almost £750m to gross domestic product (gdp), and generated more than £500m in tax receipts for the exchequer. the bulk of the money went on property, with £2.72bn spent on winners’ main properties, and £170m in paying off existing debt and mortgages.maintaining income was a priority, with £2.125bn spent on investments. gifts to family and friends accounted for £1.17bn, and £680m was spent on cars and holidays.the study, commissioned by camelot, the operators of the uk national lottery, to mark the 3,000-winners milestone, was based on research from 100 £1m-plus winners. it found that in total the 3,000 winners have purchased 7,958 houses or flats in the uk, or 2.7 each, spending £3.3bn. most winners (82%) changed their main residence, spending an average £900,000.the new home is likely to come with a hot tub, with almost a third (29%) putting that on their shopping list. a walk-in wardrobe was a must for 28%, almost a quarter (24%) opted for a property behind electric gates, and 22% had a games room, with 7% installing a snooker table.larger properties need maintaining, and 30% of winners employed a cleaner and 24% a gardener. a small proportion (5%) employed a beautician.audis were the favourite cars of 16% of winners, with range rovers and bmws also popular purchases (11% each), as well as mercedes (10%) and land rovers (5%). winners spent £463m on 17,190 cars, with the average price of their favourite being £46,116.holidays were also a priority. the majority (68%) choose five-star hotels overseas. the us was the favoured destination for 27%, followed by the caribbean (9%). closer to home, however, uk caravan sales have benefited. over the past 18 years, 10% of millionaires have bought a caravan, generating sales worth about £7.4m.some winners (15%) have started their own businesses, 9% have helped others to do so, and 6% have invested in or bought other people’s businesses. businesses started or supported by lottery winners employ 3,195 people, according to the study.andy logan, author of the report, said: “the effect of a win spreads much further and wider than we anticipated. not only does it transform the lives of friends and family, but each win has a measurable effect on the uk economy, especially with so much of it being spent in the uk. the use of each win creates a ripple effect across this generation and very often the next.”
elementary	galina zaglumyonova was woken in her flat in central chelyabinsk by a very big explosion that broke the balcony windows and broke pots containing her houseplants. when she jumped out of bed she could see a huge vapour trail in the morning sky and hear car alarms from the street below.“i didn’t understand what was going on,” said zaglumyonova. “there was a big explosion and then lots of little explosions. my first thought was that it was a plane crash.” in fact, it was a ten-tonne meteorite that fell to earth in lots of pieces.almost 1,200 people were injured. more than 40 people were taken to hospital – most of them were hurt by flying glass. there were no deaths.the meteorite entered the atmosphere at a speed of at least 33,000 miles per hour and broke into pieces between 18 and 32 miles above the ground.the event caused panic in chelyabinsk, a city of more than one million people to the south of russia’s ural mountains. people could see the vapour trail for hundreds of miles, even from neighbouring kazakhstan.tatyana bets was at work in the reception area of a hospital clinic in the centre of the city when the meteorite hit. “first we noticed the wind, and then the room was filled with a very bright light and we could see smoke in the sky,” she said. then, after a few minutes, the explosions came.at least three craters were found. one crater was more than six metres wide. another piece of meteorite broke through the thick ice of a lake.in chelyabinsk, schools and universities were closed and people were told to go home early. about 200 children were injured.many people, mostly with cuts from flying glass, came into the clinic where bets works. she said many of the students at a nearby college came to the hospital. “there were a lot of girls in shock”, she said.more than 100,000 square metres of glass were broken and 3,000 buildings were hit. the total cost of the damage in the city is probably more than one billion roubles (£20 million).the meteorite arrived a day before asteroid 2012 da14 passed earth very closely (about 17,510 miles). but experts said the two events were not connected.there were lots of rumours in the first few hours after the incident. reports on russian state television and in local media suggested that the russian military blew apart the meteorite.the ultra-nationalist leader of russia’s liberal democrat party, vladimir zhirinovsky, said it was not a meteorite. he said it was a weapons test by the united states.some people were selling pieces of meteorite through internet sites within a few hours of the impact.prime minister dmitry medvedev said that it shows us that the whole planet is vulnerable.nannan
elementary	why do people want to be a football referee? the top referees of the future smile when you ask them this question. this season, more people are criticizing referees. for this reason, some former referees have started to complain about standards. that is quite significant because, when you talk to referees, it is obvious that they always support each other.so why do they do want to be referees? why do referees spend hundreds of hours driving around the country? why do they work so hard to get the chance to make decisions on television in front of millions of people who criticize them and their ability with the help of many cameras and slow-motion replays?you might get an answer from lee swabey’s face. he looks really happy after he blows the final whistle of a 2–1 win for grimsby against woking, a match at level 5 of the english league system. he gets what all referees want every time they referee a match. “twenty-two handshakes,” he explains afterwards, proudly. “the buzz,” as he calls it, of a game that goes well, is something he loves. “i wouldn’t spend so much time away from my family if this wasn’t so important to me.”swabey is one of a group of new referees that the professional game match officials limited (pgmol) thinks is really good. so swabey knew they were watching him at that match. pgmol’s chief, mike riley, was there, and also his colleague steve dunn, watching every move the officials made.a few weeks earlier, riley, dunn and another former referee, peter jones, went to another level-5 match to check another young referee – john brooks. “i hope to have the opportunity to work in the premier league and referee at some of the top games in this country,” brooks says.unfortunately, the pgmol only saw brooks cancelling the match because of a frozen pitch. it is all part of the experience brooks needs to have before he can referee at more important games. brooks phoned his coach for advice and made the difficult but correct decision. a little later, the football club secretary arrived to pay the officials for their time – the match fee at level 5 is £95 so it is clear that these men do not do it for the money.brooks, like swabey, has clear ambitions to progress. he knows lots of people will criticize him. how does he feel when he watches football on tv and a referee is attacked? “erm … i don’t feel great,” he admits. “i do sometimes wish people understood the time and effort we put in. it is very easy to criticize a decision but we do everything to try to get these decisions right. in certain situations, you are going to be unpopular but, if you are uncomfortable with that, you are probably in the wrong job.”the former referees agree that the backup, education and tools that today’s referees have is very different from what they experienced in the past. riley, as a young referee, bought himself books on psychology and nutrition because there was no information on offer to him at all.things are very different for brooks – he has his own coach. they talk every week, discuss how his games have gone, study film of key decisions and discuss how to improve. he also has the support of a sports psychologist and an exercise regime to help him run 11km during a game.the three former referees all agree that new technology in the sport is great. “it makes the referee’s job better and makes them more effective on the field of play,” says riley. a bad decision can stay with you for a while. “the rest of your life,” says jones with a laugh.nannannannannan
intermediate	felix baumgartner stood at the edge of space above new mexico and paused slightly. it was a small step away from the capsule, but a 24-mile drop back down to earth. “our guardian angel will take care of you,” said mission control, and the man known as fearless felix jumped.ten terrifying minutes later, the austrian landed back on earth. he had reached speeds of up to 725 miles per hour, and broken three world records, including becoming the world’s first supersonic skydiver by breaking the sound barrier at mach 1.24. “we love you felix,” cheered the control room. baumgartner raised his arms in a victory salute.he was wearing a specially designed survival suit to protect him against the enormous pressure changes during the jump. without it, his blood would have boiled and his lungs might have exploded. baumgartner later told a press conference that all he could think about was getting back alive, but he added: “sometimes you have to go up really high to see how small you are.”his other two records were for the highest altitude manned balloon flight and the highest altitude skydive. the jump happened on a sunny morning in good weather. baumgartner was carried up into clear skies by a gigantic balloon – it measured 30 million square cubic feet and its skin was one-tenth the thickness of a sandwich bag. at the bottom of the balloon was a capsule, where baumgartner sat in his suit.as he reached the correct height, baumgartner went through a checklist of 40 things with his mentor joe kittinger. kittinger was the previous holder of the highest altitude manned balloon flight.baumgartner had a problem with his visor. “this is very serious, joe,” he told kitttinger. “sometimes it’s getting foggy when i breathe out.” but they decided to go ahead, watched by a record 8 million people live on youtube.after a two-and-a-half-hour journey up, during which the curvature of the earth became visible and the skies gradually turned black, the descent was much quicker. three cameras, which were attached to baumgartner’s suit, recorded his free-fall of just over four minutes and then the parachute opening.the success of the mission, and of the suit, means that astronauts might be able to survive a high-altitude disaster, like on the space shuttle columbia in 2003, by jumping out of their craft. baumgartner’s top medical man in the stunt was dr jonathan clark, whose wife laurel clark died in the columbia accident. clark is now working to help astronauts survive high-altitude disasters.baumgartner has a reputation for daring stunts. the former paratrooper has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave. he had already done two practice free-falls in preparation for this jump – one from 71,000 feet and a second from 97,000 feet. but nothing can compare with his jump above the town of roswell, a place famous for its ufo sightings.he was trying to break five different records: the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free-fall; the highest free-fall altitude jump; the highest manned balloon flight; the longest free-fall; and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history. the stunt was planned for seven years, was sponsored by red bull drinks, and beat two of kittinger’s records: before, the retired us air force colonel held the high altitude and speed records for parachuting. kittinger jumped from a balloon 19 miles above the planet in 1960 and gave advice to baumgartner during the ascent.asked after the jump what he wanted to do next, baumgartner said: “i want to inspire a generation. i’d like to be sitting in the same spot in the next four years as joe kittinger. there is a young guy asking me for advice because he wants to break my record.” he said the most exciting moment for him was when he was standing outside the capsule “on top of the world”. he added: “the most beautiful moment was when i was standing on the landing area and mike todd [the life support engineer who dressed baumgartner in his suit] appeared and he had a smile on his face like a little kid.”baumgartner said that he felt like todd’s son, adding: “he was so happy that i was alive.” earlier, todd had told the press conference: “the world needs a hero right now, and they’ve got one in felix baumgartner.”this will be the last jump, baumgartner said. he has promised to settle down and enjoy life with his girlfriend, nicole oetl, flying helicopters on rescue missions in the us and austria.nan
intermediate	the small space is set up to look like a classroom. on its corrugated iron walls are educational charts – letters of the alphabet and a map of bangladesh.but, it is hard to concentrate – there is the constant sound of hammering and chemicals in the air that stick in the back of the throat and irritate the eyes. however, the children who learn in this three-square-metre room are the lucky ones. they have escaped working in the factories opposite.for 14 years, sohay, a grassroots nongovernmental organization (ngo) funded by the global fund for children and comic relief, has been working in slum areas of dhaka to get child labourers into school. it focuses on children working in hazardous conditions.the classroom is one of 23 urban development centres that sohay has set up in the capital. the centres prepare children for primary school with classes that help them catch up on their education. once they are in primary school, the children get help with their homework at the centres.alamin, ten, who used to work in a plastic factory, attends one of the centres. his father is a street seller and his mother a part-time domestic worker. they are all happy that he’s now in school and away from hazardous work. his friend rabi says he wants to forget his past in the factory. “i like school,” he says.“the urban development centres aim to make the communities more positive about education and change their cultural mindset towards the children,” says sohay’s programme manager, mohammed abdullah al-mamun. sohay also has sessions for parents and employers to discourage child labour and offers skills training to increase family income.“getting working children into formal education is really very difficult,” says mamun. “they are not like other children. after they leave work, they sometimes find it difficult to make friends and adapt to school. it is also very difficult to make sure they stay in school – lots of these children don’t finish school.”seven-year-old zhorna akter sumayya has two older brothers – they are both in work (one at a restaurant, one at a local club). but, after her introduction to education at one of sohay’s centres, she now goes to a state primary school. her family live in the slum and her parents can’t survive without the money their sons earn. her father works in a rickshaw garage and her mother is a domestic worker, but they wanted their daughter to go to school.in 2015, sohay helped 1,540 children to leave hazardous work and 2,125 more children – those in danger of starting work – into school. about 780 more children are preparing to enter school in 2017. the organization is also helping 635 children who are working in hazardous conditions to know their rights.the labour law of bangladesh 2006 does not allow children under the age of 14 to work but, according to the un children’s agency, unicef, 4.7 million children under that age are employed and 1.3 million aged five to 17 work in hazardous industries.“it was difficult to get them into school without any compensation for their time,” says sadia nasrin, who runs sonjag, another dhaka grassroots ngo. “to solve this problem, sonjag started working closely with the community in the slums where the children live.”the organization talked to the community about why it was important for children to go to school. they chose community volunteers who wanted to change children’s lives and formed groups with social workers, community leaders, mothers, young volunteers and the local government.“the groups play a very important role – they motivate employers to let children leave for two to three hours a day to attend school and to make sure the workplace is safe for the children,” says nasrin.when the children have missed starting school at five years old, it is a race against time to prevent them from growing up without an education. “when they are older, it is really very difficult to get them to go to school,” says mamun. “children are just passing their time without education and waiting to do hazardous work. we are working to stop child labour.”nan
elementary	the direct action group uk uncut plans to make many starbucks cafés into crèches, refuges and homeless shelters to make people notice that starbucks does not pay enough tax.the house of commons questioned starbucks. they asked why the company paid no corporation tax in the uk during the past three years.uk uncut wants to show a connection between government cuts, especially the cuts that affect women, and multinational businesses who do not pay enough tax.sarah greene, a uk uncut activist, said money for refuges would be cut if companies did not pay the fair amount of tax. the government lost about £32 billion in 2011 because multinational businesses did not pay enough tax.greene said the government could easily collect billions of pounds that could help pay for important services, if they were stricter when they collect taxes.uk uncut turned its attentions to starbucks after an investigation found that the company had paid only £8.6 million in corporation tax since opening its cafés in the uk in 1998 despite sales worth £3 billion.uncut campaigner anna walker said “we’ve chosen to highlight the impact of the cuts on women. so we’re going to focus on changing starbucks into the services that the government are cutting, for example refuges and crèches.“starbucks is a really great target because it is on every high street in the country so people can take action in their local areas,” she said.starbucks says it pays the correct level of taxes. the group chief executive, howard schultz, said: “starbucks has always paid taxes in the uk.“over the last three years alone, our company has paid more than £160 million in various taxes, including national insurance*, vat and business rates.”apple, ebay, facebook, google and starbucks have avoided nearly £900 million of tax. the prime minister, david cameron, said: “i’m not happy with the current situation. we need to make sure we continue to encourage these businesses to invest in our country, but they should pay fair taxes as well.”a spokeswoman for starbucks said: “tax law can be extremely complex, but starbucks respects tax laws and accounting rules.“starbucks spends hundreds of millions of pounds with local suppliers on milk, cakes and sandwiches, and on store design and improvements. when you consider the indirect employment created by starbucks, the company’s economic impact to the uk economy is more than £80 million every year.”nannannannannannan
elementary	until the end, david bowie, who has died of cancer, still surprised us. his latest album, blackstar, appeared on his 69th birthday on 8 january 2016. it showed that he hadn’t stopped making challenging, disturbing music.throughout the 1970s, bowie was a trailblazer of musical trends and pop fashion. he became a singer-songwriter, a pioneer of glam-rock, then became involved in “plastic soul”. he then moved to berlin to create innovative electronic music.bowie was born david robert jones in south london. at 15, david formed his first band, the kon-rads, but it was soon clear that david should go solo. david took the name bowie so people wouldn’t confuse him with davy jones of the monkees.bowie’s first album, released in june 1967, was titled simply david bowie. in july 1969, bowie released space oddity, the song that would give him his first big success. timed to coincide with the apollo 11 moon landing, it was a top five uk hit.the man who sold the world was released in the us in late 1970 and in the uk the following year. with its daring songwriting and hard-rock sound, it was the first album to really show his talents.he followed it with 1972’s hunky dory, a mix of wordy, elaborate songwriting. it was an excellent collection that was not a great success. but that all changed with the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars later that year.this time, bowie appeared as ziggy stardust, a science-fiction character – an intergalactic glam-rock star visiting planet earth. the hit single starman brought instant success for the album.everything bowie touched turned to gold. he had his first uk number 1 album with aladdin sane (1973), which included the hit singles the jean genie and drive-in saturday.his interest in funk and soul music could be heard on the album young americans (1975), which included the single fame (with john lennon as a guest singer).with the album station to station (1976), bowie turned himself into a new character, the thin white duke.bowie and his wife divorced in 1980. this was a year of more creative success, with a good album, scary monsters (and super creeps), and its hit single, ashes to ashes. after this, he played the title role in the elephant man on the broadway stage.he achieved a number 1 single with his 1981 partnership with queen, under pressure. 1983 was the year in which he put his energy into the album let’s dance and his concerts. let’s dance turned bowie into a global rock star – the album and its singles let’s dance, china girl and modern love all became huge international hits.the early 80s was the heyday of mtv. bowie’s talent for making eye-catching videos increased his popularity and the six-month serious moonlight tour attracted lots of people. it was to be the most commercially successful period of his career.at the 1985 live aid concert at wembley stadium, bowie was one of the best performers. also, that year, he worked with mick jagger to record the fundraising single dancing in the street, which quickly went to number 1.a few days after he performed at the freddie mercury tribute concert at wembley stadium in april 1992, bowie married the somalian model iman and bought a home in new york.for the album black tie white noise (1993), he included elements of soul and hip hop. it went to the top of the uk album chart and gave him a top 10 single, jump they say.bowie performed at the concert for new york city in october 2001, where he joined paul mccartney, jon bon jovi, billy joel, the who and elton john in a benefit show six weeks after the 9/11 attacks.during his reality tour in 2004, bowie had chest pains while he was performing in germany and needed emergency surgery in hamburg.he saw the medical emergency as a warning and started to slow down. in february 2006, he was given a grammy lifetime achievement award. he was entered into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1996.the next day (2013) was his first album of new songs in ten years. it included the single where are we now? the album went to the top of the charts in britain and around the world. in 2014, bowie was given the brit award for best british male – he was the oldest person to get the award.he leaves behind his wife, iman, their daughter, alexandria, his stepdaughter, zulekha, and his son, duncan, from his first marriage.nannannan
elementary	the bestselling book on amazon in the us is a colouring books for adults by scottish illustrator johanna basford.basford’s pictures of animals and plants in secret garden have sold more than 1.4 million copies around the world and her next book, enchanted forest, has sold 226,000 copies already. the books have celebrity fans like zooey deschanel, who shared a link about the book with her facebook followers, and the south korean pop star kim ki-bum, who posted an image on instagram for his 1.6 million followers.“it’s been crazy. the last few weeks have been madness, but fantastic madness,” said eleanor blatherwick, head of sales and marketing at the books’ publisher, laurence king. “we knew the books would be beautiful but we didn’t realize they would be such a big success.”and it is not just basford’s books that adults want to colour in. in the uk, richard merritt’s art therapy colouring book is in fourth place on amazon’s bestseller lists, millie marotta’s animal kingdom – detailed pictures of animals to colour – is in seventh place and a mindfulness colouring book is in ninth place. basford’s books are in second and eighth place – so half of amazon. co.uk’s top ten is filled by colouring books for adults.independent uk publisher michael o’mara has sold around 340,000 adult colouring books. ana mclaughlin works for them. she says the craze has happened because they are telling people that the books will help them to relax. “the first book we did was in 2012, creative colouring for grown-ups. it sold well but it was in 2014 that adult colouring books became really popular with art therapy. we tell people they are anti-stress books so people are allowed to enjoy something they thought was childish before,” she said.the mindfulness colouring book says that it is filled with beautiful scenes and intricate, sophisticated patterns. this makes you relax “as you fill these pages with colour”. the book suggests that people “take a few minutes, wherever you are, and colour your way to peace and calm”.“i think it is really relaxing to unplug,” said basford. “and it’s creative. for many people, a blank sheet of paper is very daunting; with a colouring book you just need to bring the colour. also, people do it because they feel nostalgia for their childhoods. so many people have said to me that they used to do secret colouring in when their kids were in bed. now, people don’t feel silly. these are books for adults. the art in my books is super intricate.” the illustrator, who lives in aberdeenshire, is creating a third book.“the pictures are all over twitter and instagram. people are really proud of them – they are so intricate,” she said. “people send us pictures of them,” said mclaughlin.nannan
elementary	for 85 years, it was just a grey blob on classroom maps of the solar system. but, on 15 july, we saw pluto in high resolution for the first time. the images show dramatic mountains made from solid water ice as big as the alps or the rockies.the extraordinary images of the former ninth planet and its large moon, charon, were sent four billion miles back to earth from the new horizons spacecraft.alan stern, the mission’s principal investigator, said “new horizons is returning amazing results. the data look absolutely gorgeous, and pluto and charon are just mind-blowing.”john spencer, a mission scientist, said that one of the biggest surprises was the discovery that “there are mountains in the kuiper belt”. the kuiper belt is the solar system’s mysterious “third zone” where pluto is, with about 100,000 smaller icy objects. he said the mountains are around 3,000 metres high and several hundred miles across.pluto used to be the ninth planet but, since 2006, it has been a dwarf planet. the nasa press conference began with spectacular images of the sun and the eight official planets.stern said the images from new horizons were just the beginning and that we would learn more about the planet soon. scientists believe the mountains on pluto are made from water ice with just a thin cover of methane and nitrogen.“water ice is strong enough to hold up big mountains.” the images are the first to show ice mountains, except those found on the moons of giant planets.the images are so detailed that, if the spacecraft flew over london, we would be able to see the runways at heathrow airport.it is five billion kilometres to pluto. this means it takes new horizons hours to send back a picture and it will take 16 months to send back all the data. the team also said that the heart-shaped area on pluto will be called the tombaugh regio, after clyde tombaugh, who discovered the dwarf planet in 1930.the image of charon shows an area of cliffs about 1,000km long. the image also shows a dramatic canyon 7 to 9km deep.cathy olkin, a mission scientist, said: “charon just blew our socks off when we saw the new image. the team is so excited.”pluto is two thirds rock surrounded by a lot of ice. the temperature is about minus 230c.the £460m spacecraft is continuing its journey into the kuiper belt. scientists hope that it will help us to see and understand more of the ancient solar system and the origins of planets. it may even help to explain how the earth was made.andrew coates, the head of planetary science at the mullard space science laboratory, said: “it’s a really thrilling time for solar system exploration.”nasa says that the spacecraft will be able to keep recording and sending images until the mid- 2030s. then its plutonium power source will run out and it will drift outwards towards the edge of the solar system and deep space beyond.”nannan
advanced	writing in the journal nature, former president of the royal institute of navigation roger mckinlay argues that our reliance on gps (global positioning system) technology is misplaced and could be eroding our innate way- nding abilities. òif we do not cherish them, our natural navigation abilities will deteriorate as we rely ever more on smart devices,ó he wrote.mckinlay believes huge investment will be needed before navigation systems will be good enough to allow technologies such as autonomous vehicles to take off. in the meantime, he argues, we need better research into systems for navigation while children should be encouraged to learn how to  nd their way around by more traditional means. òschools should teach navigation and map reading as life skills,ó he wrote.according to ofcom (the of ce of communications), around 66% of adults in the uk owned a smartphone in 2015, up from 39% in 2012, making gps technology widely available. but mckinlay, a satellite communication and navigation consultant, believes that we should be wary of leaving our navigational needs to our devices. ònavigation is a use-it-or-lose-it skill,ó he wrote.while few scienti c studies have explored the issue, research from 2009 supports the notion. òwhat we did was to look at a set of current london taxi drivers and a set of london taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years,ó said neuroscientist dr hugo spiers, head of the spatial cognition group at university college london, who is an author of the study. the results showed that the retired taxi drivers performed worse on navigation tests than those still behind the wheel. òwe were able to show that their abilities did drop away if they werenõt using their knowledge on that particular test.óspiers also believes there is a danger in relying on technologies like gps but he is quick to point out that the biggest risk lies in users being unwittingly led into perilous situations. among the fatalities blamed on satnavs (satellite navigation devices) was the death of a driver who, in 2010, plunged into a reservoir in spain. òthere is a genuine potential for risk in relying on a satnav,ó said spiers. òbut the actual health risk of not using your brain effectively is not known.óthe way in which navigational technology is used could also affect its impact on our own abilities, says spiers. while audio instructions to drivers remove the need to think about navigation, he says, the use of smartphone apps as digital maps is very different. òin the old days, you had to print out or take an a to z map in your pocket ð what we are doing now is just using computer- aided information and you are having to think really quite hard about where you are going and interact with this device,ó he said. òthe modern technology isnõt just dumbing us down completely.ómckinlay remains convinced that navigation technologies have a long way to go before futuristic scenarios involving driverless cars and smart cities become a reality. òfor really critical applications ð safety applications like landing aircraft or navigating aircraft ð gps is still not good enough,ó he said.though spiers believes the development of arti cial intelligence based on machine learning could lead to a new wave of navigational aids, mckinlay remains sceptical. òwe will see ever- smarter machines which are very, very task speci c, but the big breakthrough will be when they are able to tune in to what you might be thinking and what you might be wanting to achieve,ó he said.ultimately, mckinlay believes, itõs essential that humans remain able to take control of their navigation. òdo you really want to encourage people to get to a point where, when it disappears or when the battery goes  at, they are in total shock and can do nothing?ó he said. òtechnology isnõt magic ð it is just a tool.ó
elementary	a company from the netherlands wants to turn dreams of reaching mars into reality. the company, mars one, plans to send four astronauts to the red planet to build a human colony in 2023. but there are two serious problems.firstly, on mars the astronauts’ bodies will have to adapt to gravity that is 38% of gravity on earth. this would probably cause such a total change in their bones, muscles and circulation that the astronauts would no longer be able to survive on earth. secondly, they will have to say goodbye to all their family and friends, because there is no return ticket.the mars one website says that the astronauts cannot expect to return. to return, they would need a rocket that can leave mars. the rocket would need life support systems for a seven-month journey and would need to either join up with a space station or land safely on earth.but the project has already had 10,000 applicants, according to the company’s medical director, norbert kraft. he told the guardian that the applicants so far were aged 18 to at least 62 and, although they include women, they were mostly men.mars one says that the astronauts must be resilient, adaptable, curious, trusting and resourceful. they must also be over 18.mars one says that the basic things people need to live are already present on the planet. for example, they can take water from ice in the soil and mars has sources of nitrogen, the primary element in the air we breathe. the colony will use solar panels to get power, it says.the project will cost around $6 billion. some of this money could come from tv broadcasting rights. “the money made broadcasting the london olympics was almost enough to pay for a mission to mars,” bas lansdorp, the company’s founder, said.another person who supports the project is paul römer, one of the creators of big brother, one of the first and most successful reality tv shows. “this mission to mars could be the biggest media event in the world,” said römer. “a reality show and a talent show, with no ending and the whole world watching.”mars one wants to build a permanent human colony, according to its website. the first team would land on mars in 2023 to begin building the colony, and a team of four astronauts would arrive every two years after that.but some people are sceptical of the project, and some people are worried about how astronauts might get to the planet and build a colony with all the life support and other things they need.the mission hopes to inspire people to “believe that all things are possible, that you can achieve anything,” like the apollo moon landings.“mars one believes it is not only possible but necessary that we build a permanent colony on mars so that we can improve our understanding of the solar system, the origins of life, and our place in the universe,” it says.nannannannannannannannan
advanced	nelson mandela, the towering figure of africa’s struggle for freedom and a hero to millions around the world, has died at the age of 95.south africa’s first black president died in the company of his family at home in johannesburg after years of declining health, which had caused him to withdraw from public life.the news was announced to the country by the current president, jacob zuma, who, in a sombre televised address, said mandela had “departed” around 8.50pm local time and was at peace.“this is the moment of our deepest sorrow,” zuma said. “our nation has lost its greatest son. what made nelson mandela great was precisely what made him human. we saw in him what we seek in ourselves.“fellow south africans, nelson mandela brought us together and it is together that we will bid him farewell.”zuma announced that mandela would receive a state funeral and ordered that flags fly at half-mast.archbishop desmond tutu led a memorial service in cape town, where he called for south africa to become as a nation what mandela had been as a man.barack obama led tributes from world leaders, referring to mandela by his clan name – madiba. the us president said: “through his fierce dignity and unbending will to sacrifice his own freedom for the freedom of others, madiba transformed south africa – and moved all of us.“his journey from a prisoner to a president embodied the promise that human beings – and countries – can change for the better. his commitment to transfer power and reconcile with those who jailed him set an example that all humanity should aspire to, whether in the lives of nations or our own personal lives.”uk prime minister david cameron said, “a great light has gone out in the world,” and described mandela as “a hero of our time”.fw de klerk – the south african president who freed mandela, shared the nobel peace prize with him in 1993 and paved the way for him to become south africa’s first post-apartheid head of state – said the news was deeply saddening for south africa and the world.“he lived reconciliation. he was a great unifier,” de klerk said.people gathered in the streets of south africa to celebrate mandela’s lifein soweto, people gathered to sing and dance near the house where he once lived. they formed a circle in the middle of vilakazi street and sang songs from the anti-apartheid struggle. some people were draped in south african flags and the green, yellow and black colours of mandela’s party, the african national congress (anc).mandela’s death sends south africa deep into mourning and self-reflection, nearly 20 years after he led the country from racial apartheid to inclusive democracy.but his passing will also be keenly felt by people around the world, who revered mandela as one of history’s last great statesmen, and a moral paragon comparable with mohandas karamchand gandhi and martin luther king.it was his act of forgiveness, after spending 27 years in prison, 18 of them on robben island, that will assure his place in history. with south africa facing possible civil war, mandela sought reconciliation with the white minority to build a new democracy.he led the anc to victory in the country’s first multiracial election in 1994. he then voluntarily stepped down after one term.born rolihlahla dalibhunga in a small village in the eastern cape on 18 july, 1918, mandela was given his english name, nelson, by a teacher at his school.he joined the anc in 1943 and became a co-founder of its youth league. in 1952, he started south africa’s first black law firm with his partner, oliver tambo.mandela was a charming, charismatic figure with a passion for boxing and an eye for women. he once said: “i can’t help it if the ladies take note of me. i am not going to protest.”when the anc was banned in 1960, mandela went underground. after the sharpeville massacre, in which 69 black protesters were shot dead by police, he took the difficult decision to launch an armed struggle. he was arrested and eventually charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government.conducting his own defence in the rivonia trial in 1964, he said: “i have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.“it is an ideal which i hope to live for and to achieve. but, if needs be, it is an ideal for which i am prepared to die.”he escaped the death penalty but was sentenced to life in prison, a huge blow to the anc, which had to regroup to continue the struggle. but unrest grew in townships and international pressure on the apartheid regime slowly tightened.finally, in 1990, fw de klerk lifted the ban on the anc and mandela was released from prison amid scenes of jubilation witnessed around the world.his presidency rode a wave of tremendous global goodwill but was not without its difficulties. after leaving frontline politics in 1999, he admitted he should have moved sooner against the spread of hiv and aids in south africa.archbishop desmond tutu, who headed the truth and reconciliation committee after the fall of apartheid, said: “he transcended race and class in his personal actions, through his warmth and through his willingness to listen and to empathize with others. and he restored others’ faith in africa and africans.”mandela continued to make occasional appearances at anc events and attended the inauguration of the current president, jacob zuma. his 91st birthday was marked by the first annual “mandela day” in his honour.married three times, he had six children, 17 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.
advanced	there are worse things to do in life than stroll along rioõs copacabana beach in the sunshine on the way to watch a world cup match, so it was perhaps not surprising that england fan anthony mcdowell from liverpool was having none of the doom and gloom that preceded some of the build-up to the tournament in brazil. òthe place is lovely. the people are great. thereõs a party atmosphere,ó said mcdowell. òthe only thing that could be better is the england team.óhe and half a dozen friends are among the multitudes of supporters from around the world who have made the beachfront into a party zone of national colours and chants. some danced, some posed for photos, some drank, but mostly they just walked and talked football, waiting for the next game to begin on the nearby fanfest big screen. the last time there were so many people here during the daytime, the pope was visiting.the cheerful, largely peaceful mood was far from the protests, transport chaos and stadium problems that plagued preparations for the world cup. but, now the football is well and truly under way, visiting supporters are determined to enjoy the experience. òif i had known, when i started planning, how complicated and costly it would be, i wouldnõt have come. but, now that weõre here, itõs great,ó said brian hill, a retired chief executive from sunderland.the trip has not been problem free. hill travelled for more than 20 hours to get to rio, then hit long delays on the road from the airport at 6.30am. his son, andrew, had his sunglasses stolen almost as soon as he sat on the beach. and, they have been surprised that many bars are not set up with big screens for the games. but, like many fans, they said they loved the atmosphere, if not the logistics, of this tournament which has got off to a spectacular start on the pitch.even the surliest cynic cannot have failed to be thrilled by robin van persieõs extraordinary diving header for the netherlands against spain. elsewhere, there has been a glut of goals: 28 in the  rst eight games ð almost three times as many as at the same stage in south africa in 2010. adding to the carnival mood on the streets, where the majority of fans are from neighbouring nations, latin-american teams won in every game they played up until the time of writing.so far, the tournament has avoided the worst doomsday scenarios, though it is far from trouble free. the stadiums may have been delivered late and ð in some cases ð not fully  nished, but there have been no reports of structural problems or dif culties entering the grounds since the kickas at previous world cups, ticketing has been a problem, with many empty seats at several games, including the netherlands against spain. fifa spokesman saint-clair milesi con rmed that only 48,000 of the 51,900 seats at the ground were  lled. fifa is also investigating security lapses that allowed chilean fans to let off  reworks during their victory over australia.the globo newspaper listed a number of shortcomings in the 12 host cities. almost all suffered worse traf c congestion than usual. the worst transport problems were in natal, where bus drivers have been on strike since 12 june. in salvador, some journey times were  ve times longer than usual. òtraf c was already bad but this week it is chaotic,ó jecilda mello, president of residentsõ group the association of friends of the historic centre, told the paper.but, protests have diminished since the opening day, when small demonstrations took place in several cities, prompting police to use tear gas and pepper spray. since then, the only security threat has been petty theft and overexcited fans. a spontaneous street party of argentinian fans was dispersed with pepper spray after the fans blocked roads.the huge distances have led to some sharply contrasting world cup experiences. the tournament has made only a small mark on sa_o paulo, south americaõs most populous city, but, far away in manaus ð the remote amazonian city where england played italy ð visitors said world cup fever was in full swing with brightly decorated streets and  ags  uttering on many cars.the fa chairman, greg dyke, said the shift in mood was palpable. weve had a really warm welcome in manaus. its a big thing for them, even if it is a bit strange to spend so much on a stadium with no one to play in it. but we were in sao paulo for four or  ve days in the run-up to the opening match and you wouldnt have known until the last day that there was even a world cup on. it was weird.
elementary	the canadian tennis player frank dancevic criticized the people who organize the australian open because they forced players to play tennis in terrible conditions.dancevic collapsed during the second set of his match against france’s benoît paire on the uncovered court six at melbourne park. he said conditions were dangerous for the players. he also said the heat caused him to hallucinate: “i was dizzy from the middle of the fi rst set and then i saw snoopy and i thought, ‘wow, snoopy – that’s weird.’”“i don’t think it’s fair to anybody – to the players, to the fans, to the sport – when you see players passing out,” he added. “passing out with heat stroke, it’s not normal.“i, personally, don’t think it’s fair and i know a lot of players don’t think it’s fair.”other players agreed. the british number one, andy murray, said: “it’s defi nitely a problem. it only takes one bad thing to happen. and it looks terrible for the whole sport when people are collapsing, ball kids are collapsing, people watching are collapsing. that’s not great.“i know the conditions at 2.30–3pm were very, very hard. if it’s safe or not, i don’t know. there have been some problems in other sports with players having heart attacks.”caroline wozniacki said: “i put the water bottle down on the court and it started melting a little bit. so, you know it was warm.”john isner said: “it was like an oven when i open the oven and the potatoes are ready. that’s what it’s like.”victoria azarenka said, “it felt pretty hot, like you’re dancing in a frying pan or something like that.”organizers said the highest temperature was 42.2c in the early evening on tuesday but it was never hot enough to stop the matches.“the weather was hot and uncomfortable, but the humidity was quite low, so play could continue,” tournament director wayne mckewen said.dancevic, who said he felt dizzy from the middle of the second set, unsurprisingly lost 7–6, 6–3, 6–4. “i nearly stopped completely,” he said. “i wasn’t really running too much towards the end. i wasn’t tired; i just felt my body temperature was too high.”a ball boy needed help from doctors when he collapsed during milos raonic’s 7–6, 6–1, 4–6, 6–2 victory over daniel gimeno-traver on exposed court eight.china’s peng shuai also said the heat had made her cramp up and vomit, and someone had to help her leave the court after her 7–5, 4–6, 6–3 defeat to japan’s kurumi nara.organizers said most matches were completed without anyone needing help from doctors.“of course, there were a few players who had heat-related illness or discomfort, but none needed much help from doctors after their match,” tim wood, the tournament’s chief medical offi cer, said.roger federer said that the weather was hot, but it was the same for both players. “it’s just a mental thing,” the swiss said. “if you’ve trained hard enough all your life, or the last few weeks, and you believe you can do it and come through it, there’s no reason. if you can’t deal with it, you throw in the towel.”dancevic disagreed. “some players are used to the heat – their bodies can deal with the heat and others’ can’t,” dancevic said. “it’s dangerous. it’s an hour and a half since my match and i still can’t pee.”
advanced	fit in four minutes. it sounds like a headline from a health magazine; an unattainable promise on late-night satellite tv. then you attempt dr izumi tabata’s training protocol – 20 seconds of all-out effort, 10 seconds of rest, repeat eight times – and between sounding like darth vader as you desperately suck in oxygen and collapsing in a messy bundle of sweat and defeat, you realize just how wrong you were.tabata has seen it all before. “they were dead!” he chuckles as he recalls the first time he inflicted the system that bears his name on his university students in the early 1990s. “after four minutes’ hard exercise they were wiped out. but after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised. we all were.”his research followed extensive monitoring of japan’s speed skating team in the early 1990s when he – along with the team’s coach irisawa koichi – noticed that short bursts of brutally hard exercise seemed to be at least as effective as hours of moderate training. tabata set out to show this with a simple experiment. one group of moderately trained students performed an hour of steady cardiovascular exercise on a stationary bike five times a week. the other group did a ten-minute warm-up on the bike, followed by four minutes of tabata intervals, four times a week – plus one 30-minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of intervals.the results were startling. after six weeks of testing, the group following tabata’s plan – exercising for just 88 minutes a week – had increased their anaerobic capacity by 28% and their vo2 max, a key indicator of cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power, by 15%. the control group, who trained for five hours every week, also improved their vo2 max, but by 10% – and their training had no effect on anaerobic capacity. “we have also measured increases in heart size after three weeks of doing the protocol,” says tabata. “and there is also forthcoming research that shows that it lowers the risk of diabetes in humans, something we have already shown in rats.”but there are no half-measures here. you can’t go steady on a cross trainer, chewing gum and reading the latest issue of hello! the regimen demands head-down bursts on a stationary bike or rowing machine; explosive bodyweight exercises, sprints or suchlike. remember how you felt after doing a 100m sprint at school? imagine doing eight of them with only a tensecond break to recover.“all-out effort at 170% of your vo2 max is the criterion of the protocol,” says tabata. “if you feel ok afterwards you’ve not done it properly. the first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossibly hard. in the original plan the aim was to get to eight, but some only lasted six or seven.”as one commenter on the popular exercise forum t-nation puts it: “when done correctly you should meet god. most people are incapable of doing it correctly and shouldn’t even try.”tabata doesn’t completely agree. “everyone can do it but beginners should start with educated trainers so that they can work at the correct intensity for them,” he explains. he says that he will soon publish research showing that doing the programme just twice a week, less than half the volume in the original research, still provides significant health benefits.another soon-to-be-published finding, which tabata describes as “rather significant”, shows that the tabata protocol burns an extra 150 calories in the 12 hours after exercise, even at rest, due to the effect of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption. so while it is used by most people to get fit – or by fit people to get even fitter – it also burns fat.it’s slightly surprising, therefore, that the plan is still the preserve of the serious athlete and musclehead crowd – although that may change now that tabata has agreed a deal with universal studios that will lead to a network of instructors and a dvd range released towards the end of the year. “i decided to do this because i often go on youtube and, while i am honoured that people are doing it, some are doing it wrong because they don’t realize the intensity you need to work at,” says tabata.so should we all start incorporating this plan into our fitness regimens? richard scrivener, a former assistant strength and conditioning coach at northampton saints rugby club, says that while the benefits are clear, tabatas are an addition, not a replacement, to a favoured sport or training method. “runners, for instance, need a high level of running economy, which comes from skill acquisition and putting in the miles,” says scrivener, “but they could effectively ease off the long runs and reduce the overall mileage by introducing tabata training. this will unload the skeleton and give joints the chance to rest and recover, especially if one is prone to niggles or has a history of injuries – and you would probably therefore get more out of the long runs when you do undertake them.”gym rats can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three tabatas a week. and the rest of us can build up session by session, week by week, all the time knowing that it will never get easier because every session calls for maximum effort. that’s the cruel genius of the protocol: it is unrelenting – and effective.
intermediate	what surprised researchers was not how hard people found the challenge but how far they would go to avoid it. the task? to sit in a chair and do nothing but think.some found it so unbearable that they took the safe but alarming opportunity to give themselves mild electric shocks to break the tedium.two-thirds of men pressed a button that gave them a painful shock during a 15-minute period of solitude.under the same conditions, a quarter of women pressed the shock button. the difference, scientists suspect, is that men are typically more sensation-seeking than women.the report from psychologists at virginia and harvard universities tries to answer the question of why most of us  nd it so hard to do nothing.in more than 11 separate studies, the researchers showed that people hated being left to think, regardless of their age, education, income or the amount of time they spent on smartphones or social media.timothy wilson, who led the work, said the  ndings were not necessarily due to the pace of modern life or the spread of mobile devices and social media. instead, those things might be popular because of our constant need to do something rather than nothing.in the  rst experiments, students were taken ð alone, without phones, books or anything to write with ð into a room and told to think. the only rules were that they had to stay seated and not fall asleep. they were told that they would have six to 15 minutes alone.the students were questioned when the time was up. on average, they did not enjoy the experience. they struggled to concentrate. their minds wandered even with nothing to distract them.in case the unfamiliar setting reduced the ability to think, the researchers did the experiment again with people at home.they got similar results. in fact, people found the experience even more miserable and cheated by getting up from their chair or checking their phones.to see if the effect was found only in students, the scientists tested more than 100 other people, aged 18 to 77, from a church and a farmersõ market. they also disliked being left to their thoughts.but, the most surprising result was yet to come. to check whether people might actually prefer something bad to nothing at all, the students were given the option of giving themselves a mild electric shock.they had been asked earlier to say how unpleasant the shocks were, compared to other options, such as looking at pictures of cockroaches or hearing the sound of a knife rubbing against a bottle.all the students chosen for the test said they would pay to avoid mild electric shocks.to the researchersõ surprise, 12 of 18 men gave themselves up to four electric shocks and six of 24 women did the same.the scientists said that the most surprising thing was that being alone with their thoughts was so hard for many people that they gave themselves an electric shock ð something the participants had earlier said they would pay to avoid.jessica andrews-hanna at the university of colorado said many students would probably give themselves an electric shock to cheer up a tedious lecture. but, she says we need to know more about the motivation of the shockers in wilsonõs study.òimagine ð a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will deliver a harmless but uncomfortable shock, and they are told to just sit there with their thoughts,ó she said.òas they sit there, their mind starts to wander and it naturally goes to that shock ð was it really that bad?ónan
elementary	nobody knows which came first: the economic crisis in greece or shisha, the drug that is called the “cocaine of the poor”. but everyone agrees that shisha is a killer. and it costs only €2 or less.“it is the worst drug. it burns your insides, it makes you aggressive and makes you go mad,” said maria, an ex-heroin addict. “but it is cheap and it is easy to get, and everyone is taking it.”this drug crisis is making problems for athens’s health authorities, who already have the problem of large financial cuts.thousands of homeless greeks, who live on the streets because of poverty and a loss of hope, are taking shisha. the drug is related to crystal meth. it is often mixed with battery acid, engine oil and even shampoo. it can make users become aggressive. and, even worse, it is easy to buy and easy to make.“it is a killer, but it also makes you want to kill,” konstantinos, a drug addict, said. “you can kill without understanding that you have done it. a lot of users have died.”charalampos poulopoulos, the director of kethea, greece’s anti-drug centre, said shisha is an “austerity drug” – it is made by dealers who have become clever at making drugs for addicts who can no longer afford heroin and cocaine.“the crisis has given dealers the possibility to sell a new, cheap drug, a cocaine for the poor,” said poulopoulos. “you can sniff or inject shisha and you can make it at home – you don’t need any special knowledge. it is extremely dangerous.”in all parts of greece, there is a lot of depression, and drug and alcohol abuse. crime has increased because austerity measures have cut the income of ordinary greeks by 40%. prostitution – the easiest way to pay for drugs – has also increased.there are more suicides and hiv infections, and drug addicts (around 25,000 people) have become more and more selfdestructive. sixty-four per cent of young people in greece are unemployed – this is the highest youth unemployment in the eu.at the time when organizations such as kethea need extra help, the greek state has cut by a third the money it gives them. the european commission, european central bank and international monetary fund asked them to do this to help save the greek economy.since the economic crisis began in 2009, kethea has lost 70 of its 500 staff. they get less money, but studies show that for every euro the greek state spends on anti-drug programmes such as kethea, it saves about €6 because there is less crime and fewer health problems. “the cuts are a huge mistake,” said poulopoulos.on the streets of athens, there is a fear that austerity not only doesn’t work – it kills.nannannannannan
elementary	dr ben brabon of edgehill university teaches a mooc – a massive open online course. the course is one of only two accredited moocs in the uk at the moment. brabon says that many students enrol on moocs because they are free and they enjoy communicating with other students. moocs have no entry tests and no fees, so mooc students behave very differently from students on normal higher education courses.moocs are the newest idea to try to make higher education available to everyone. companies are investing a lot of money in new websites that offer sophisticated and interactive courses to tens of thousands of students. investors hope to find a business model for moocs that will make them profitable. they could earn money by finding out why and when millions of students enrol, interact with their material, submit their assignments, message each other and stop the course.nobody can say exactly who moocs are for. universities that want to attract fee-paying international students onto postgraduate courses by showing them their best programmes online? students in developing countries who really want access to first-world universities? employees who wish to develop their professional knowledge? people without qualifications who want to use moocs as a bridge to higher education? or hobby learners, who want to learn about a subject they find interesting?moocs may be popular at the beginning but very few people complete them, says dr brabon. his literature course had 1,000 enrolments but only 31 people completed the course. “and almost all of those had a first degree or had been educated to degree level,” he says. “so it seems moocs do not make higher education available to people who couldn’t go into higher education before.”“learning online is a different thing and needs quite advanced learning skills,” says david kernohan, an expert in digital technology. “with moocs, there’s very little support: the student does not get any individual attention.” students get support from other students in online discussions. this may mean that online study is unattractive or difficult for someone without high-level qualifications, but it suggests that moocs could be “a really good tool for continuing education,” he added.the number of part-time students has reduced as the cost of studying at university increases, so could open and free courses provide a new path to university education? could you teach a whole degree via moocs? “i don’t think that’s how moocs work,” says brabon. instead, he suggests “blended learning that combines a campus experience with a mooc; also, perhaps, using moocs to create a global degree, with students taking courses from across the world, might be possible.”but that’s in the future. at present, the course content and assessment standards of moocs have no quality assurance, so employers will not be impressed by them. accreditation is now essential for moocs so academics and employers will believe they are of good quality, says brabon.some people hope that moocs will bring the best of first-world teaching to students in less developed countries. others believe that universities could use moocs to advertise their campus courses to bigger numbers of fee-paying students from outside the eu.mike sharples, chair of educational technology, doesn’t agree. moocs are mainly a way to publicize and share universities’ best teachers. they also encourage interaction and feedback from students around the world, he says. he believes that attracting international students onto university courses is not the main aim of moocs. but they could certainly be a very clever marketing idea, as he says that “if 20,000 people enrol on a mooc – well, you only need 20 of those to enrol afterwards to have a master’s course.”“in south america, china and countries in africa, there are many people who want to learn and some of the world’s best courses are now online,” adds sharples. “if people are fascinated by learning, then why not? the real challenge is to allow those countries not just to study moocs, but also to create them.”nan
elementary	there is a time in some men’s lives when the days seem darker, death is more certain, and the only thing they want to do is spend all their money on a sportscar.radical changes in lifestyle are normal for the midlife crisis. if the midlife crisis is real, then humans may not be the only animals to get it.now an international team of scientists say they have found evidence that chimpanzees and orangutans are less happy in their middle years. this, they say, is the ape equivalent of the midlife crisis.the study says that the midlife crisis may come from the biology humans share with apes.alex weiss, a psychologist at edinburgh university, told the guardian that most people agree that our level of well-being reduces in middle age.he said that in the study they asked if it’s possible that the midlife crisis is not just something human.the team from the us, japan, germany and the uk asked zookeepers and others who worked with male and female apes of various ages to complete questionnaires on the animals.the questionnaires included questions about each ape’s mood, the enjoyment they got from being with other apes and people, and their success in doing things. the final question asked if the keepers would like to be the ape for one week.more than 500 apes were included in the study in three separate groups. the first two groups were chimpanzees, and the third were orangutans from sumatra or borneo. the animals came from zoos, sanctuaries and research centres in the us, australia, japan, canada and singapore.when the researchers analyzed the questionnaires, they found that well-being in the apes decreased in middle age and increased again as the animals became old. in captivity, great apes often live to 50 or more. the animals felt the most unhappy, on average, at 28.3 and 27.2 years old for the chimpanzees, and 35.4 years old for the orangutans.“in all three groups we find that chimpanzees and orangutans are most unhappy at an age that is roughly equal to midlife in humans,” weiss said.robin dunbar, professor of evolutionary psychology at oxford university, was sceptical about the study. “it’s hard to see anything in an ape’s life that would give a sense of well-being over such a long time.”alexandra freund, professor of psychology at the university of zurich, was also sceptical. she said “in my opinion, there is no evidence for the midlife crisis.”but weiss believes the study could give us a deeper understanding of the emotional crisis some men may experience. “if we want to find what’s going on with the midlife crisis, we should look at what is similar in middle-aged humans, chimps and orangutans,” he said.nannan
intermediate	the business idea is to produce a cheap light that gets free power from gravity and could end the use of dangerous kerosene lamps in africa and india.but when british designer, patrick hunt, tried to get money from banks or venture capitalists to launch his invention, he hit a problem. “we tried to get funding to make it happen, but it’s slow and complex and it’s unproven and nobody wants to take a risk,” he said.so he tried crowdfunding on a us website, indiegogo, which has recently opened in the uk. within five days, he hit his target and raised £36,200. his campaign to get donations from the public was so popular that within 40 days he had raised £400,000.the led light is powered by a dynamo driven by a 10kg bag of rocks. the weight is attached to the light, lifted to a height of about 2m, and while it slowly falls to the ground it will generate enough power for half an hour of light.hunt is preparing for production in china and will test the market again by sending 1,000 of the lights to africa before the full mass production of millions of units.he is one of a new wave of entrepreneurs who are turning to the fast-growing crowdfunding industry for money. another new site is investingzone, which matches wealthy people with start-up entrepreneurs.indiegogo does not offer shares but allows users to offer “perks” for different levels of investment – people who helped to fund hunt’s light felt good about helping the less rich, but also got their own light.for danae ringelmann, co-founder of indiegogo, the “gravity light” is a perfect example of how meritocratic crowdfunding can be and how it can test an entrepreneur’s idea. “it is the first time that getting money has been fast, efficient and meritocratic, because it is not about ‘how do i get access to the decision makers in that bank?’ or ‘who do i know in that venture capital company?’ this is all about proving your worth to your customers and fans, getting them to agree your idea will work and fund it.“even ideas that don’t get funding are worth testing, because you will have saved yourself a lot of time finding out it wasn’t a good idea and getting smarter faster,” she says.ringelmann, who is based in the us, started her career as a wall street analyst. in 2008, she decided to quit and use her skills to try and help friends who worked in the arts to raise money.five years on and the site is raising about $2m a week for new businesses in start-up and growth stages. in december 2012, it launched a euro and a sterling service to get a foothold on this side of the atlantic and says britain is its third biggest market. international activity is up 41% since december.there is no shortage of competitors, be it kickstarter, seedrs or funding circle, but indiegogo is the only crowdfunder where anyone can launch a campaign. no project is thought too wacky.the site charges a 4% fee for successful campaigns. for those that fail to raise their target amount, users can either refund all money to their contributors at no charge or keep all money raised but pay a 9% fee.a british woman raised £100,000 to open a “cat café” in london through the site. called lady dinah’s cat emporium, it is not open yet but is advertised as somewhere people can “come in from the cold to a comfortable chair, a hot cup of tea, a book and a cat”.“we’ve seen campaigns that go to venture capitalists get rejected because the venture capitalists say ‘great idea but no idea if the market actually wants it; it could be something that no one cares about,’” said ringelmann.“the entrepreneurs do an indiegogo campaign and this can be enough market proof for venture capitalists to say there is a market for this.“it allows you to test your market, test your pricing, test your features, discover new ways of getting money, get vital feedback,” says ringelmann.with her wall street background and the experience of helping 100,000 businesses and services raise money, ringelmann has useful advice for budding entrepreneurs.“ideas are a dime a dozen. it’s all about the execution and, if you are afraid that your idea will be stolen by someone who could execute it better and faster than you, then you are not the right person to execute that idea. it’s all about confidence to move fast and to learn,” she says.while crowdfunding as an alternative to banks has grown, it is not very attractive to big-bucks investors who want a stake in a promising business. that could start to change in the uk with the launch of investingzone.nannan
elementary	the uk prime minister, david cameron, says he is happy about the result of the scottish referendum. 55% of people in scotland voted to keep the 307-year-old union with england and wales, and 45% voted against it. the prime minister promised more devolution in great britain.earlier, scotlandõs  rst minister, alex salmond, said he accepted scotland had not decided to vote for independence this time. he said the referendum was a òtriumph for democratic politicsó and he said he would work with the government in london in the best interests of scotland and the rest of the uk. òwe have touched sections of the community who have never before been touched by politics,ó he said.the yes campaign had four big successes ð it won 53% of the vote in scotlandõs largest city, glasgow, 57% in dundee and 51% in north lanarkshire. but the no campaign won in 28 areas. it won easily in areas where people expected it to do well, including edinburgh, aberdeenshire and borders. but it also did well in areas that people said might go to the yes campaign, including the western isles. in total, the no campaign won 2,001,926 votes (55.3%) and the yes campaign won 1,617,989 votes (44.7%).in his speech, cameron said that there would be constitutional reforms, including in scotland, but not until after the general election. and he said that there would be changes in england, too. òwe have heard the voice of scotland and, now, we must hear the millions of voices of england,ó he said.cameron added: òthe people of scotland have spoken and it is a clear result. they have kept our country of four nations together and, like millions of other people, i am delighted. as i said during the campaign, it would have broken my heart to see our united kingdom come to an end. so, now, it is time for our united kingdom to come together and to move forward with a balanced settlement, fair to people in scotland and, importantly, to everyone in england, wales and northern ireland, as well.óed miliband, the leader of the labour party, said the referendum was a vote from the scottish people for change. òwe know our country needs to change. we will deliver stronger powers for a stronger scottish parliament, a strong scotland.ó but he said that would go beyond scotland. òwe will also make changes in england, wales, and the whole of the united kingdom.ónick clegg, the deputy prime minister, said a vote against independence was ònot a vote against changeó. òwe must now deliver the radical new powers to scotland,ó he added.the uk independence party leader, nigel farage, said cameronõs offer of more devolution for england did not go far enough. òthe english are 86% by population of this union. theyõve not been a part of this for the last 18 years. we still have a situation where scottish mps can vote in the house of commons on english-only issues. i think what most english people want is a fair settlement,ó he said.cameron will try to calm tensions when he makes another statement on the result. the prime minister will explain how he will give more powers to the scottish parliament in edinburgh. the prime minister wants to move fast to show that the three main uk party leaders will keep the promises they made during the referendum campaign.nannannannan
advanced	sometimes life just isnõt fair. mark zuckerberg created facebook and is now worth an estimated $48bn. james goodfellow also invented something used by millions of people around the world every day ð the cash machine ð but it didnõt make him rich. in fact, he earned just £10 from the patent and has not made a penny more from it since.òyou can imagine how i feel when i see bankers getting £1m bonuses. i wonder what they contributed to the banking industry more than i did to merit a £1m bonus. it doesnõt make much sense to me but thatõs the way of the world,ó goodfellow says.it also annoys him that heõs not seen as a good role model for inventors and engineers. he came up with a groundbreaking invention that generated billions of pounds òand i got nothing, so whoõs going to want to follow in james goodfellowõs footsteps and get £10 if they have a fantastic success?óthere have been arguments for years over who should of cially go down in history as òthe inventor of the atmó and, in 2005, a man called john shepherd-barron received a uk honour for services to banking as the òinventor of the automatic cash dispenseró. but, the uk government is now saying it was goodfellow who invented the atm ð so it would seem that, after all the squabbling, his place in history is now assured.back in the mid-1960s, goodfellow was working as a development engineer and had been asked to devise a way to enable customers to withdraw cash from banks on saturdays. òmost people working during the week couldnõt get to the bank. they wanted a solution. the solution was a machine which would issue cash on demand to a recognized customer,ó he recalls. òi set out to develop a cash-issuing machine and, to make this a reality, i invented the pin [personal identi cation number] and an associated coded token.óthis token took the form of a plastic card with holes punched in it. the patent documents proposed a system incorporating a card reader and buttons mounted in an external wall of the bank and stated: òwhen the customer wishes to withdraw a pack of banknotes from the system, he simply inserts his punched card in the card reader of the system and operates the set of ten push-buttons in accordance with his personal identification number.óaside from the cards with punched holes, that pretty much describes todayõs atm. after goodfellow successfully demonstrated the methodology by producing a model, prototypes were built and the  rst machines were installed in 1967.at around the same time, shepherd-barron was developing a rival cash-dispensing device. his machine didnõt use plastic cards ð instead, it used cheques impregnated with carbon-14, a mildly radioactive substance. the machine detected the carbon-14, matched the cheque against a pin and paid out the cash.it is widely accepted that the shepherd-barron atm was the òworldõs  rstó when it comes to being installed and used by the public; the  rst one, at a bank in north london, was opened on 27 june, 1967 ð a month before goodfellowõs atm made its public debut. however, the patent for goodfellowõs machine was lodged on 2 may, 1966, 14 months before the london atm machine came into service.the rivalry between the two men bubbled up when shepherd-barron received an of cial honour for his achievement. goodfellow says: òmy one big regret is that i never said anything about it until john shepherd-barron received the obe in 2005. this honour was granted on the basis that he was the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser. that really stuck in my throat and i kicked up a bit of a fuss.óshepherd-barron is no longer alive to put his case but, in a 2005 interview, he was fairly withering about his rival: òi donõt know him but itõs clear that the difference between goodfellow and us was that we thought through the whole system concept and that was important to the banks who bought it. his invention reminds me of the hovercraft, an elegant failure.óthe cash machine has become a world- conquering piece of technology and nothing ð the contactless revolution, bitcoin, wearable technology, etc ð seems to be slowing its growth: there are now 3m atms worldwide, with the number forecast to hit 4m by 2020.goodfellow accepts he didnõt invent the concept of a cash-issuing machine òbut i did invent a way of doing it. when people talk about the wright brothers, they didnõt invent the concept of  ying ð everyone was trying to do it ð but they did it and got the credit for inventing the aeroplane so i think i should get the credit for inventing the cash dispenser.óthe good news for goodfellow is that this is now starting to happen. the website atminventor.com concludes: òwho invented the idea of an atm? we believe it was luther george simjian. who invented the atm as we know it? we have to think it was james goodfellow in scotland for holding a patent date of 1966. who invented the atm design we recognize today? we think it was john d white for docutel in the us.ó even better for goodfellow, his achievement has been of cially recognized in the latest edition of a 180-page guidebook called life in the united kingdom. in the section about ògreat british inventions of the twentieth centuryó, it states: òin the 1960s, james goodfellow (1937-) invented the cash-dispensing automatic teller machine (atm) or ôcashpointõ.óso after all these years, goodfellow  nally  nds himself being talked about in the same breath as john logie baird (the television), alan turing (the turing machine), sir frank whittle (the jet engine) and sir tim berners-lee (the world wide web). asked what he did with the £10 he received back in the 1960s, goodfellow says he thinks he blew it on a wild night out, adding: òit didnõt change my life.ó but, he concludes, itõs been a good working life: òi was very happy doing the job i was doing.ó
elementary	tua pittman from raratonga in the cook islands is a traditional navigator. to him, a canoe is more than just a form of transport. òthe canoe is our island, the crew is the community and the navigator is the leader,ó he says. òon a canoe, you are not just going from one place to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds. navigation is showing your crew the light of life.óit has been a busy week for the crews of four sailing canoes ð they are in sydney for the start of the world parks congress. tuaõs journey began at the cook islands on 25 september. the islanders sailed to samoa, then fiji, vanuatu and onto the gold coast. then, they travelled south to sydney. around 100 crew were involved in the voyage and they tried to travel using only traditional navigation techniques. sadly, said tua, the crews had to use modern navigation equipment sometimes to reach australia in time for the congress.the trip is called the mua voyage. it is a partnership between the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) oceania regional of ce and  ve paci c island countries: samoa, tonga, new zealand, the cook islands and fiji. the main aim of the 11,000km trip was to deliver a special message to the world parks congress.the message said òwe see fewer  sh than in the past, and they are smaller. and foreign  sherman take our  sh. our coral reefs, the greatest in the world, and our  shing grounds are disappearing. our ocean is very big but not limitless.óthe paci c islandersõ message to the delegates of the congress was urgent. but a lot of time has been spent at the congress trying to set a new target for the amount of the ocean that needs special protection. according to the iucn, in 2013, less than three per cent of the worldõs oceans was in marine protected areas and less than one per cent of that is ôno takeõ (no  shing). but there should be a lot more ôno-takeõ areas because the last world parks congress in 2003 set a target of 20-30%.after dif cult talks, the world parks congress agreed new targets for marine protected areas. the new target is not 20-30%; it is at least 30%. and they must try to solve the problem of biodiversity.tua pittman is very happy with what the congress has decided for the worldõs oceans. òitõs a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here. to hear they made that decision is fantastic. itõs a step in the right direction.óhe is 55 and, in his lifetime, he can already see that it is much harder to catch  sh. he also said that pollution is getting worse, particularly close to big cities such as sydney. and climate change is already having a serious effect on paci c islanders. òthe decisions of the big countries have a small effect on developed, large countries, but they have a very big effect on small countries.óthe mua voyage had taken years of preparation and planning. it was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and took action. pittman said that the leaders of rich countries should think more like traditional navigators who see that their boats are just tiny specks in an enormous sea. most importantly, tua says that politicians must change how they do things. òthe world needs to  nd a different path.óthe mua voyage had taken years of preparation and planning. it was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and took action. pittman said that the leaders of rich countries should think more like traditional navigators who see that their boats are just tiny specks in an enormous sea. most importantly, tua says that politicians must change how they do things. òthe world needs to  nd a different path.ó
intermediate	when larry pizzi first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago, he asked: “why would anyone want to screw up a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it?”it’s a question that still puzzles some people. bicycle shops in the us do not usually sell e-bikes, even though they have been around since the late 1990s.pizzi, who is now ceo of currie technologies, the number one seller of e-bikes in the us, believes that’s about to change. others in the bike industry agree. familiar brands including trek, raleigh and specialized all offer electric models and they believe that the market is about to take off.the us is different from other countries when it comes to electric bikes. nearly 32m e-bikes were sold in 2014, most of them in china, where they are mostly used for transportation. they are popular in much of europe, too. they’re common in the netherlands and switzerland; german postal workers use them to get around and bmw offers one for about $3,000.electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds, which rely on motorized power; they are bicycles that can be pedalled with – or without – help from an electric motor. riding an e-bike feels like riding a normal bike with a strong wind behind you; the motor just helps you go faster or climb hills. unlike mopeds, e-bicycles are usually permitted on bike paths and they can’t travel faster than 20mph.to succeed, the electric bike business in the us must overcome legal, cultural and financial obstacles. e-bikes are banned in some states, including new york. some people who own and work in bike shops don’t like putting motors on bicycles – one of the reasons is the extra weight. some e-bikes weigh nearly 30kg.e-bikes are also expensive. while cheaper models sell for as little as $700, court rye, the founder and editor of electricbikereview.com, a popular website, says riders should expect to pay at least $1,500 for a quality e-bike with a good battery. the best models cost more than twice that.the companies that make and sell e-bikes say they can overcome those obstacles. e-bike technology, particularly the batteries, is improving. “batteries are getting smaller, they’re getting lighter, they’re getting more reliable and they are lasting longer,” says don dicostanza, the founder and ceo of pedego, an electric bikemaker and retailer.companies like bosch, the german electronics giant, and shimano, the leading manufacturer of bicycle gears, are entering the business. this should help lower the resistance from bike shops. “this has really caught the attention and the imagination of bicycle dealers,” says currie’s larry pizzi. pedego and startup electrobike aren’t waiting for the shops to come around; they are building their own stores.perhaps most importantly, more cities are building cycling infrastructure including bike lanes so bicycle commuting has become more popular. as the us census bureau reported in 2014, the number of bike commuters grew from about 488,000 in 2000 to 786,000 in 2012. electric bikes make commuting more practical – and fun – by reducing worry about hills, headwinds, tiredness and sweat.most of our customers are “ageing baby boomers who want to have the cycling experience they had as a kid,” says pedego’s don dicostanza. “the main reason they stopped riding bikes was because of hills.” pedego has opened nearly 60 stores in the us and it has sold bikes to tour companies in san francisco and washington, dc.electrobike, which operates 30 stores in mexico, opened its first american store in venice beach, california in the autumn of 2014 and hopes to grow to 25 us stores in a year. ceo craig anderson says: “we want to help reduce traffic, help reduce our carbon footprint and encourage a healthy lifestyle.” he tells customers: “ride this once and try not to smile.”startups like pedego and electrobike will have to compete with big companies like trek and currie, which, in 2012, was acquired by the accell group, a public company based in the netherlands that is europe’s market leader in e-bikes. accell owns the raleigh brand, as well as haibike, an award-winning german electric bike.“accell has great hopes for e-bikes in north america,” currie’s larry pizzi says. “while baby boomers are still very important, we’re finding that a lot of younger people are using e-bikes for transportation, instead of cars.”accell’s yuba brand even sells a cargo bike with a stronger motor and rear rack. “you can carry two children,” says pizzi. “you can carry 45kg of shopping. it’s a minivan alternative.”nannan
intermediate	it began with a bogus scallop, but a menu scandal that has affected some of japan’s top hotels and department stores now threatens the international reputation of the country’s food.since one luxury hotel chain admitted lying about ingredients on its menus, japanese media have written stories of similar incidents in restaurants run by well-known hotels and department storesthe story began when the hankyu-hanshin hotel chain, based in osaka, admitted it had given false descriptions of dozens of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and october 2013, which affected an estimated 78,000 diners.one of the worst menu misdemeanours was a red salmon ‘caviar’ dish that was actually the less luxurious eggs of the flying fish.the hotel group’s president, hiroshi desaki, went on television to announce a 20% pay cut for himself and 10% for other executives but this did not make consumers any less angry.days later, desaki resigned, saying that the hotel group had “betrayed our customers.” one of the hotel’s head chefs later declined a medal of honour he was going to receive from the government.the company has so far refunded 20 million yen to more than 10,000 consumers. the final bill is expected to reach 110 million yen.consumers who believed they had eaten expensive kuruma shrimps were told they had in fact eaten the much cheaper black tiger version.the scandal started when a diner complained in a blogpost that a ‘scallop’ dish he had ordered at the prince hotel in tokyo contained a similar, but cheaper, type of shellfish.the hotel started an investigation and as a result corrected more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants. its report scared hankyu-hanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they, too, had hoodwinked diners who believed they were paying high prices for top ingredients.the hotel okura chain – whose guests have included barack obama – said they had also injected beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly described tomatoes as organic.“we deeply apologize for betraying the expectations and confidence of our clients,” it said in a statement.the list of fraudulent ingredients continues to grow: orange juice from cartons sold as freshly squeezed; mont blanc desserts topped with korean chestnuts instead of the promised french ones; shop-bought chocolate cream that the menu said was home-made; imported beef sold as expensive wagyu.even the government’s top spokesman, yoshihide suga, commented on the scandal. “this inappropriate labelling has resulted in the loss of trust among consumers,” he told reporters.the fraudulent menu scandal has exploded at just the wrong time. japan is trying to persuade south korea and other countries to lift a ban on food imports that began after the fukushima nuclear accident. and unesco is considering a request to add japanese cuisine to its cultural heritage list.one local newspaper had the headline, “japan’s proud food culture in tears,” while the newspaper yomiuri shimbun said it was “shocked by the industry’s lack of morals”.industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 had forced luxury hotels to cut costs while attempting to woo diners with detailed menu descriptions.“menu descriptions were created to meet consumers’ preferences, and, when they couldn’t get the ingredients on the menu, hotels just used food from different places,” hiroshi tomozawa, a hotel and restaurant consultant, told kyodo news.the industry’s biggest problem will come from japan’s demanding consumers. in 2009, 72% of diners in japan said that, when they were choosing from a menu, where the food is from was the most important thing for them, followed by the amount of calories and other nutritional details.nannannan
intermediate	it is hard to tell exactly where the noise is coming from, but impossible to miss it from anywhere in damascus. all day and all night you can hear the sound of guns, rockets or planes attacking rebel positions – the sound of war getting closer to syria’s capital. just over two years after the syrian crisis began, the people of damascus have learnt to ignore the sound of death and destruction just a few miles away.“actually you do get used to it after a while,” said george, an it technician. “but you never know exactly what they are hitting.” that usually becomes clear later from video clips posted by the opposition on youtube.the constant background noise is more worrying because the government tries so hard to keep an atmosphere of business as usual. “as you can see, everything here is fine but we have to hit the terrorists, these extremists,” an army officer announced. one government official said: “if i was afraid, i would just shut my door and stay inside. i have to work and i am not afraid. if i don’t defend my country, who will?”in private conversation, ordinary people are less defiant. in the centre of town, a shopkeeper complained sadly that his baby daughter cries at the sound of explosions. zeina, a twentysomething student, is afraid she might become desensitized to suffering – and perhaps to danger too. “in the beginning, when there started to be explosions, i used to have nightmares,” she reflected. “now i can sleep through anything.”and, the risks are increasing even closer to home. in sabaa bahrat square, in what was supposed to be the safest part of damascus, a car bomb exploded, leaving the front of a building black, its windows broken and also damaging the imposing structure of the syrian central bank next door. the square is often used for televised pro-regime rallies, with people chanting slogans under giant banners of president bashar al-assad.that bombing was not the worst damascus has experienced as the situation has deteriorated. in february, reports say that 80 people, including schoolchildren, died near the ruling ba’ath party headquarters in mazraa. you can still see the crater, marked by an enormous patch of fresh asphalt on the main road going north. “i live nearby but luckily i wasn’t there,” recalled munir, a university lecturer.mortar bombs, fired from rebel-held areas now very close to the city, have become a worrying new development. the bombs killed 15 students in a university cafeteria on 28 march. the intended target was probably a government building.there has been increased security since the bombing of the national security crisis cell in july 2012, when four of assad’s most senior aides were killed. concrete blast barriers – often painted in the syrian flag’s black, red and white – now protect official buildings, not just the military or defence installations that are obvious targets. the iranian embassy in mezze now looks like a fortress. “the regime did manage to set up a ring of steel round damascus,” a foreign diplomat said. he added that there are now holes in that ring of steel and that brings home the reality of the war.all this means that moving around has become difficult, unpredictable and time-consuming – another part of life today in an understandably nervous city. checkpoints on main roads stop traffic for id checks and baggage searches with handheld explosive detectors – vital to stop future bombers. only drivers with an official security clearance can use special fast lanes to avoid the wait.it is hard, however, to avoid the question on everyone’s mind: will there be a battle for damascus – the world’s oldest continually inhabited city, as the guidebooks say – like the one that has so damaged aleppo? parts of the city already feel like a war zone: its most exclusive and expensive hotel is almost empty, although many rooms are being used as offices by international agencies with white un vehicles parked behind the blast barriers outside. the streets empty soon after 9pm.one view is that the fight for syria’s capital is coming, but not quite yet – in the summer perhaps, some predict, when the rebels have made further progress in the south. others argue that a complete victory by either side is unlikely and hope for a political solution that comes from abroad. but few people here seem to expect things to get any better.nannan
elementary	the chief medical officer for england compared the problem of antibiotic resistance to the risks of international terrorism. but, each year, the number of deaths around the world from bacterial resistance is far more than the number of deaths from terrorist attacks.the world health organization says that each year more than 150,000 people die from tuberculosis because of antibiotic resistance. this is now a war.a hundred years ago, life expectancy in the uk was about 47 years for a man and 50 years for a woman. lots of young children died. about 30% of all deaths were in children under the age of five, mostly because of infectious disease.but a child born in britain today has more than a 25% chance of reaching their 100th birthday. we can thank public health systems, vaccination and antibiotics for this.in intensive care, antibiotic resistant bacteria are most common. here, powerful antibiotics are used very often. these drugs kill ordinary bacteria. but they cannot kill strong bacteria that have begun to learn how to survive antibiotic drugs.when i became a doctor in the 1990s, i learnt about methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a bacteria that is resistant to methicillin and all other penicillins. there were just a few drugs that could kill it – for example, vancomycin and teicoplanin. but antibiotic resistant bacteria became more and more common.in our hospitals and our doctor’s surgeries we use antiobiotics too often.also, we have put antibiotics into the food chain, when we grow food and when we put anti-bacterial drugs into food for farm animals.we thought that antibiotics were something we could use forever. we thought that companies would continue to make more and more antibiotics.but this is no longer true. we have found new, more resistant bacteria. the vancomycin that we used to treat mrsa infection no longer worked. we found vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa) in our hospitals. and other bacteria were becoming resistant too.today, infections with organisms that are very resistant are common, but fewer and fewer new antibiotic drugs are made. it is more and more difficult to develop new drugs that can kill resistant bacteria. antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop, that are only used in short courses and that quickly stop working because of bacterial resistance.this war against bacteria is different from all other wars. there needs to be change in the way doctors give antibiotics and we need to use fewer antibiotics in farming. and we have to give companies good reasons why they should make new antibiotics, which will not make them lots of money.today, antibiotic resistance has become a normal part of life. less than a hundred years after the discovery of penicillin, we are beginning to lose the fight.
intermediate	glastonbury festival is declaring war on the plastic water bottle as part of a long-term plan to become the world’s most environmentally friendly outdoor music event.festival organizers are targeting the disposable bottle, one of the most obvious symbols of the throwaway culture, that each year leaves the 900-acre festival site covered in plastic. an estimated one million plastic bottles are used during the festival.stainless-steel reusable bottles will be given to 2,000 road crew and band members. thousands more will go on sale to festival-goers to stop them relying on plastic bottles. the 140,000 ticketholders are also being asked to bring reusable bottles that they can fill at 400 drinking-water taps across the site.lucy smith, glastonbury’s green issues organizer, said: “we have amazing water quality in the uk but everyone is obsessed with drinking bottled water.”she said that, in 2015, glastonbury also plans to replace all plastic glasses and cutlery with reusable items.environmentalists say that there is currently 150 million tonnes of plastic waste around the planet and oceans, poisoning ecosystems and killing wildlife.ultimately, festival organizers hope to make glastonbury the world’s greenest greenfield festival. they want to be like america’s burning man festival in the black rock desert of nevada, which is a “leave-no-trace” event, where people have to take away all that they bring.glastonbury festival-goers are also being asked to travel to the site on public transport or to try car-sharing with friends. “we want to be as sustainable as we can. we do everything we can, but the litter of 140,000 people is a challenge. we can’t put bins everywhere,” added smith.plastic water bottles can take hundreds or even thousands of years to completely biodegrade. their manufacture makes their negative ecological impact even worse. millions of barrels of oil are used in the manufacture of plastic bottles and the transportation of mineral water across the planet produces even more carbon emissions.around 13 billion plastic water bottles are sold in the uk every year, but only one in five is recycled.smith said that, instead of buying bottled water, festival-goers should take advantage of the water on tap, which comes from huge underground reservoirs. the charity wateraid will also set up water kiosks around the site, which will stock reusable bottles and cups and offer free refills.organizers say that almost half of all the rubbish left on site was recycled in 2013 and add that there will be 15,000 bins for recycling across the festival grounds in 2014.even though it is becoming more environmentally friendly, critics say that glastonbury is becoming increasingly corporate. iron maiden’s bruce dickinson said he would never bring his band to glastonbury festival, which he called “the most bourgeois thing on the planet”.nan
intermediate	according to a recent report, the wealthiest people in india will become four times richer by 2018, with hundreds of thousands of new entrepreneurs and inheritors becoming multimillionaires. the survey, based on interviews with 150 wealthy individuals, comes at a time when there are signs of returning business confidence in the world’s biggest democracy.recent years have seen weak economic growth, rising prices of basic foods and a fall in the value of the indian currency. but the bharatiya janata party (bjp) won a landslide victory in may 2014 with its promise to improve the economy. despite the economic slowdown, there are now nearly a sixth more indians worth more than $3.75m than in 2013, the report says. “cities are mushrooming, the middle class population growing, opportunities have increased many times over and the political environment has improved greatly in recent months,” says murali balaraman, a co-author.between them, india’s rich hold assets worth a trillion dollars, which is around a fifth of the total wealth in the country. by 2018, that total is likely to reach $4tn, the report says, making three times as many people multimillionaires.a booming luxury market is serving the new rich. “they really want to show or talk about their wealth in a really subtle way and buying luxury goods is a nice way to do it,” balaraman said. abhay gupta, the ceo of brand consultancy luxury connect, said the market for luxury goods and experiences would “only get bigger”. “there is a huge aspirational class who look up to what the very wealthy are doing and then copy it,” he said.cars are among the most popular items bought, the report says. whereas, in 2009, locally made suvs were shown off by the wealthy, now only foreign cars will impress people. mercedes saw a 47% growth in sales in india in 2013. bmw has launched a new $200,000 model in delhi.india’s appalling infrastructure limits demand for luxury cars, however. lamborghini’s chief executive, stephan winkelmann, admitted, in 2013, that the traffic and roads in india “are not so suitable” for the $450,000 sports cars. in india, lamborghini sells two models: the gallardo and the aventador, which has a top speed of 217mph. winkelmann said lamborghini’s indian customers were much younger than those in europe, with a typical buyer being in his 30s. however, the most popular investments are still real estate – mainly within india – and jewellery.india’s super-rich have often surprised people around the world with their spectacular spending. mukesh ambani, the country’s wealthiest man, has built the world’s most valuable home in mumbai, the commercial capital. the 27-storey tower, complete with helicopter pads, indoor cinemas and a staff of more than 600, is worth $1bn.the three-day wedding of the niece of lakshmi mittal, the uk-based steel tycoon who is worth $16bn, was reported to have cost $80m. hundreds of guests were flown to barcelona for the ceremony and party, which took place in a museum in the city.but buyers of exclusive luxury goods are becoming more and more demanding, the report says. one buyer ordered nine cases of japanese whisky costing over $750 a bottle for a wedding reception. the attraction of the imported whisky was that no one who attended the wedding would know how to find the same drink in india. another big spender bought identical pairs of louis vuitton bags, then cut up half of them to make clothes that would match her accessories.even the traditional wedding is changing. traditionally, presents such as silver plates, dried fruit or sweets are sent with wedding invitations. but, now, these presents are being replaced by gifts by top western designer brands. “these days, it’s rolex watches and louis vuitton bags,” says gupta.almost half the new multimillionaires live in smaller cities and a high proportion give large amounts to charity. co-author balaraman says that growth in the number of rich people would not result in social tensions because a wide gap in incomes and wealth is an “accepted norm” in india. “people know that someone is rich and someone is poor and they carry on with their lives,” he explains.nan
intermediate	a company from the netherlands is trying to turn dreams of reaching mars into reality. the company, mars one, plans to send four astronauts on a trip to the red planet to set up a human colony in 2023. but there are a couple of serious problems.firstly, when on mars the astronauts’ bodies will have to adapt to surface gravity that is 38% of that on earth. it is thought that this would cause such a total change in their bone density, muscle strength and circulation that the astronauts would no longer be able to survive in earth’s conditions. secondly, and directly related to the first, they will have to say goodbye to all their family and friends, as there is no return ticket.the mars one website states that a return “cannot be anticipated nor expected”. to return, they would need a fully built rocket with enough fuel for the return journey, which is able to escape the gravitational field of mars, and has on-board life support systems for a seven-month trip. and they must be able to link up with a space station orbiting earth or perform a safe re-entry and landing.nevertheless, the project has already had 10,000 applicants, according to the company’s medical director, norbert kraft. he told the guardian that the applicants so far ranged in age from 18 to at least 62 and, though they include women, they were mostly men.the reasons they gave for wanting to go were varied, he said. an american woman called cynthia, who gave her age as 32, said that it was a childhood dream of hers to go to mars.she told the project: “when i first heard about the mars one project i thought, this is my chance – that childhood dream could become a reality. i could be one of the pioneers, building the first colony on mars and teaching people back home that there are still uncharted territories that humans can reach for.”the main attributes mars one is looking for in astronaut-settlers are resilience, adaptability, curiosity, ability to trust and resourcefulness, according to kraft. they must also be over 18.mars one says that the basic things required for life are already present on the planet. for instance, water can be taken from ice in the soil and mars has sources of nitrogen, the primary element in the air we breathe. the colony will be powered by specially adapted solar panels, it says.the project will cost a reported $6bn, and bas lansdorp, the founder of mars one, has said he hopes this money will be collected partly by selling broadcasting rights. “the broadcasting revenue from the london olympics was almost enough to finance a mission to mars,” lansdorp said.another ambassador to the project is paul römer, the co-creator of big brother, one of the first, and most successful, reality tv shows. “this mission to mars could be the biggest media event in the world,” said römer. “reality meets talent show with no ending and the whole world watching.”the aim is to establish a permanent human colony, according to mars one’s website. the first team would land on mars in 2023 to begin building the colony, with a team of four astronauts every two years after that.the project has its sceptics, however, and people are worried about how astronauts might get to the planet and build a colony with all the life support and other requirements needed.the mission hopes to inspire generations to “believe that all things are possible, that anything can be achieved,” like the apollo moon landings.“mars one believes it is not only possible but necessary that we establish a permanent colony on mars in order to speed up our understanding of the formation of the solar system, the origins of life and, of equal importance, our place in the universe,” it says.nannannannannannan
advanced	the forests – and suburbs – of europe are echoing with the growls, howls and silent padding of large predators, according to a new study that shows that brown bears, wolves and lynx are thriving on a crowded continent. despite fears that large carnivores are doomed to extinction because of rising human populations and overconsumption, a study published in science has found that large-predator populations are stable or rising in europe.brown bears, wolves, the eurasian lynx and wolverines are found in nearly one-third of mainland europe (excluding belarus, ukraine and russia), with most individuals living outside nature reserves, indicating that changing attitudes and landscape-scale conservation measures are successfully protecting species that have suffered massive persecution throughout human history.bears are the most abundant large carnivore in europe, with around 17,000 individuals, alongside 12,000 wolves, 9,000 eurasian lynx and 1,250 wolverines, which are restricted to northern parts of scandinavia and finland. only belgium, denmark, the netherlands and luxembourg in mainland europe – like britain – have no breeding populations of at least one large carnivore species. but the paper’s lead author and other conservationists said these animals’ surprising distribution across well-populated regions of europe showed that even the british countryside could support big predators.guillaume chapron from sweden’s university of agricultural sciences and researchers across europe found wolves, in some cases, living in suburban areas alongside up to 3,050 people per square kilometre – higher than the population density of cambridge or newcastle. on average in europe, wolves live on land with a population density of 37 people per sq km, lynx in areas with a population density of 21 people per sq km and bears among 19 people per sq km. the population density of the scottish highlands is nine people per sq km.“in order to have wolves, we don’t need to remove people from the landscape,” said chapron. according to chapron and his colleagues, the big-carnivore revival shows the success of a “land-sharing” model of conservation – in stark contrast to keeping predators and people apart by fencing off “wilderness” areas, as occurs in north america and africa.“i’m not saying it’s a peace-and-love story – coexistence often means conflict – but it’s important to manage that conflict, keep it at a low level and resolve the problems it causes. wolves can be difficult neighbours,” said chapron. “we shouldn’t be talking about people-predator conflict; we have conflict between people about predators. these animals are symbolic of difficult questions about how we should use the land.”according to the researchers, this “land-sharing” approach could be applied elsewhere in the world. the reasons for its success in europe include political stability, burgeoning populations of prey species such as wild deer and financial support for non-lethal livestock protection such as electric fences, which mean that farmers do not resort to shooting wild predators. most crucial, said chapron, has been the eu habitats directive, which has compelled member states to protect and revive rare species.“without the habitats directive, i don’t think we would have had this recovery,” he said. “it shows, if people are willing to protect nature and if political will is translated into strong legislation like the habitats directive, it’s possible to achieve results in wildlife protection.” the revival was welcomed by author and commentator george monbiot, who is launching rewilding britain, a new charity to encourage the return of wild landscape and extinct species.“it is great to see the upward trend continuing but britain is completely anomalous – we’ve lost more of our large mammals than any country except for ireland,” he said. “apart from the accidental reintroduction of boar, we’ve done almost nothing, whereas, in much of the rest of europe, we’ve got bears, lynx and wolves coming back. it’s a massive turnaround from the centuries of persecution.”the survey found the eurasian lynx living permanently in 11 population groups across 23 european countries, of which only five were native populations, indicating the success of reintroduction efforts. according to monbiot, momentum is building for the reintroduction of the lynx into the cairngorms in scotland.“if it works in the rest of europe, there’s absolutely no reason why it can’t work in the uk,” he said, pointing out that bears and wolves are found within an hour of rome. “there’s no demographic reason why we can’t have a similar return of wildlife in the uk.”
elementary	american researchers say that a nasal spray containing the ‘love hormone’ oxytocin could help children with autism behave more normally in social situations. scans of autistic children showed that the chemical made the brain respond better to faces. this could make social interactions easier for them.the researchers said oxytocin might help other treatments that are used to help people with autism in social situations. “over time, there would be more normal social responding. autistic people would be more interested in interacting with other people; there would be more eye contact and more conversation,” said kevin pelphrey, of yale university.autism is a disorder that one in 100 people have. it affects people in different ways, but causes difficulties in social interaction and communication. so far, there is no effective treatment for the social problems that autism causes.researchers at yale have studied the brain chemical oxytocin. they say it is a possible treatment for the social problems caused by autism because it plays an important role in bonding and trust. but not all results are positive: one recent study found no significant benefit for young people who took the chemical for several days. but pelphrey said oxytocin might help the brain learn from social interactions; it would work best when used together with therapies that encourage people with autism to interact more socially, he said.scientists tested 17 young people aged eight to 16 with autism. they gave them either oxytocin or a placebo through a nose spray. then, the scientists scanned their brains while they looked at images of cars or the eyes of people expressing different emotions.the scans showed that some parts of the children’s brains behaved more normally after oxytocin: they were more active when the person was looking at faces and less active when the person was looking at the cars“the study suggests that oxytocin might treat basic social motivation. this is something for which we don’t have a treatment in autism,” said pelphrey. he said that it was too early to use oxytocin as a treatment for the social difficulties caused by autism and said people should not buy oxytocin online. “we don’t want them to try oxytocin at home. it is impossible to say what they are buying. this is not a treatment yet. it needs more research,” he said.but, the scientists were surprised to find that oxytocin did not help the children in social recognition tasks. it is also not known yet if oxytocin only has benefits for people with autism or has any bad side effects. finally, oxytocin effects only last about 45 minutes, so it might be difficult to use it as a treatment.“this study has a lot of evidence from animal and human work to show that oxytocin helps, but we need more research.” said simon baron-cohen.uta frith, who studies autism at university college london, said: “according to this study, oxytocin may make faces more interesting. disappointingly, this effect is seen only in brain activity and not in behaviour.” she said that, if we want oxytocin to become an important treatment for autism, we need to show that is has an effect on behaviour.nan
elementary	it was a beautiful summer evening and i decided to go for a swim from doolin pier in county clare, ireland, where i moved in 2012. there was a woman in the water with dusty, a dolphin who has a great relationship with a group of people she regularly swims with. dusty arrived in doolin in about 2008. hundreds of people have swum with her, so everyone thinks that she’s totally tame.that evening, the woman was tickling dusty’s tummy and it looked so nice in the water. there were about 20 tourists and locals on the pier. they were looking at this lovely sight. just after i got into the water, dusty left the woman she was with and went crazy – i found out afterwards that she’s very territorial when she is with somebody. her tail was flapping wildly and, at first, i thought it was a display but, then, i realized she was angry. i knew i had to get out of the water so i swam towards the pier. but, within seconds, dusty crashed into me with her nose. it was very powerful and painful, and the speed was amazing.all the people on the pier were staring at me with their mouths open. dusty was still in the water beside me, her tail flapping crazily. that was the most frightening thing: i thought, if she hits me with her tail, i could go under the water and drown.i was at the pier but i couldn’t get out because of my injuries. i was terrified. i shouted for help and a man put his arm in and pulled me out of the water. then, another man appeared and said he was a doctor. i was so cold and very worried – i didn’t know how bad my injuries were and my biggest fear was internal bleeding. the doctor said he didn’t think i had internal bleeding but he thought i probably had broken bones. i found out later that i had six spinal fractures, three broken ribs and a damaged lung.i was in hospital for five days and i couldn’t work for five months. i couldn’t move normally and i was in pain. then, doctors told me i had posttraumatic stress. my near-death experience made me anxious about everything. i felt that people were looking at me in the wrong way, i began to have problems with loud noises and i suffered from memory loss. i could no longer work.it was the hardest year ever but, now, things are better. i had therapy, osteopathy and massage. i work as an osteopath now. i understand how the patients feel because i have been a patient myself.i am grateful that i am healthy. i really want to prevent other people being injured. we think dolphins are lovely and we have faith in them – who would think a dolphin would ever attack a person? if you see a dangerous animal coming towards you with big teeth, it’s scary, but dolphins have this lovely, wide smile.i don’t have any anger towards dusty. i respect her. but i was in her territory and she’s a wild, unpredictable animal. people need to know that. so many people come here to swim with her and they don’t understand how dangerous it can be. several other people were injured that summer.after the man pulled me out of the water, dusty swam away but, then, she came back and looked at me. our eyes met and i felt she was sorry for what she did to me. she was a totally different dolphin; the anger was gone. the people on the pier were amazed. when she had that little moment with me, that was the end of the terror. i forgave her.
elementary	not sleeping very much used to be a sign that you were busy and important. sleep was for wimps. but now, arianna huffington’s the sleep revolution, a book that says we need to sleep more and promises to change your life, is a new york times best-seller.businesses have realized that they can make money from the sleep revolution. a whole range of businesses are interested in where, when and how we sleep and, also, how much we will pay for it. luxury hotels give people “sleep retreats”; more than $1,000 gets you dinner and a movie about sleep. and, if you’re staying home, you can improve your bedroom with a mattress cover with a sensor that monitors your sleep ($249) or a sleeping mask that monitors your brainwaves and lets you sleep more efficiently ($299).sleep has not only become big business – it has also changed companies. many companies already have sleeping areas and huffington says that nap rooms in offices will become “as common as conference rooms” in the next two years. so, how did this happen? how did sleep suddenly become so fashionable?many people these days find it normal to pay $10 for green juice and $34 for an indoor cycle class. and these people have made getting enough sleep a part of their lifestyle. our bodies have become machines that we monitor for better efficiency and sleep is now another set of data for us to follow. huffington does not say that sleep rests you; she says it restores you. sleep is now an important status symbol for some people.but, it is not always easy to get enough sleep; you have to go to bed in the right neighbourhood and in the right body. many studies show that you’re more likely to sleep badly if you’re poor. it’s hard to sleep if you’re worried about your safety or haven’t had enough to eat. it’s hard to sleep if you’re one of the 15 million americans who work irregular hours. research has also found that there’s a black/white sleep gap. one study shows that white people sleep an average of 6.85 hours but african americans only sleep an average of 6.05 hours. they also have a lower quality of sleep.do you know who gets the most sleep and the best quality of sleep in america? rich white women. and, they are probably the people huffington wrote her book for. huffington describes her ideas about sleep as a “revolution” but, in fact, it’s a rebranding. the real problem with sleep isn’t that a few rich people think it’s a waste of time; the problem is that 99% can’t afford to spend time sleeping.sleep may make you perform better but it’s an inefficient way to improve your performance. the real prize is finding a way that humans can work on less sleep. it is no surprise that the us military is researching this. in 2008, the pentagon published a report called “human performance” which examined the possibility of a future in which soldiers could perform at their best with only a couple of hours’ sleep. “imagine that you could make a human who slept for the same amount of time as a giraffe (1.9 hours per night). this would reduce the number of deaths and injuries. an enemy would need 40% more soldiers to be able to fight us.”one day, humans will find a way to remove the need to sleep completely. spending a third of your life asleep won’t be a luxury anymore; it will be something only the poor will have to do. then, we may need a whole new sort of sleep revolution.nan
advanced	the tranquil chorus of the natural world is in danger of being lost to todayõs generation as people screen out the noises that surround them, a senior us researcher warns.rising levels of background noise in some areas threaten to make people oblivious to the uplifting sounds of birdsong, trickling water and trees rustling in the wind, which can often be heard even in urban centres, said kurt fristrup, a senior scientist at the us national park service.the problem was exacerbated by people listening to music through their earphones instead of tuning in to the birds and other sounds of nature that can easily be drowned out by traf c, music and other noises, he said.òthis learned deafness is a real issue,ó fristrup told the american association for the advancement of science meeting in san jose. òwe are conditioning ourselves to ignore the information coming into our ears.óòthis gift that we are born with ð to reach out and hear things hundreds of metres away, all these incredible sounds ð is in danger of being lost through a generational amnesia,ó he said.òthere is a real danger, both of loss of auditory acuity, where we are exposed to noise for so long that we stop listening, but also a loss of listening habits, where we lose the ability to engage with the environment the way we were built to,ó he added.for the past ten years, the us national park service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 sites across the us, including yosemite in california, yellowstone and denali in alaska. not one was unaffected by some form of noise from human activity, be it over- ying aircraft, motorbikes, motorboats or tour buses.fristrupõs team combined the sound levels recorded from national parks with similar data from urban settings to create a model of noise levels across the us. they predict that noise pollution is growing faster than the us population and more than doubles every 30 years.òitõs not surprising people are putting on earphones or even noise cancelling headphones to try and create a quieter or more congenial environment,ó he said.òas you raise background sound levels, it has the same effect on your hearing that fog would have on your vision. instead of having this expansive experience of all the sounds around you, you are aware of only a small area around you,ó he said. òeven in most of our cities, there are birds and things to appreciate in the environment, and there can be very rich natural choruses to pay attention to. and that is being lost.ópeople quickly become accustomed to changes in their environments, including rising noise levels, and, over time, fristrup fears that we will accept far worse environmental conditions than we should and forget how much quieter the world could be. òif  nding peace and quiet becomes dif cult enough, many, many children will grow up without the experience and i think itõs a very real problem,ó he said.the warning came as other scientists reported bene cial health effects from listening to natural sounds. speaking at the same meeting, derrick taff, a social scientist at pennsylvania state university, described preliminary experiments which suggest that listening to recordings from national parks, of waterfalls, birdsong and wind, helped people recover from stressful events.in one experiment, taff told participants who visited his lab to give an impromptu talk that would be judged by researchers standing behind a one-way mirror. measurements of their heart rate and the stress hormone, cortisol, before and after the speech found that people calmed down faster when they listened to nature recordings than when the same audio tracks were interspersed with sounds from road traf c, aeroplanes and even normal conversation.òwe know that natural sounds are very important to people. they are some of the main reasons people visit protected areas. they want to hear the natural quiet, the birdsong, and the wind and water,ó taff said. òwe may be losing this as people are listening to ipods all the time but i do believe that the public is appreciative of these sounds. my advice is to go to your protected areas and experience what you are missing.ówhy natural sounds might be calming to people is unclear but fristrup speculates that, over millions of years of evolution, we may have come to associate the more tranquil sounds of the natural world with safety. òi suspect thereõs something about these intact soundscapes that reminds our ancestral brains of a place thatõs safe, where thereõs no sense of a predator nearby, and that these more cluttered soundscapes are problematic for us because we know weõve lost that surveillance capability,ó he said.
