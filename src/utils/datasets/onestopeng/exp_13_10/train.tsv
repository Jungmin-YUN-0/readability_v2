intermediate	it was a beautiful summer evening and i decided to go for a swim off doolin pier in county clare, ireland, where i moved in 2012. there was a woman in the water with dusty, a dolphin who has a great relationship with a group of people she regularly swims with. dusty arrived in doolin in about 2008 and hundreds of people have swum with her since, giving the impression that she’s totally tame.that evening, the woman was tickling dusty’s tummy and it just looked so inviting. there were about 20 tourists and locals on the pier, looking at this lovely spectacle. just after i got into the water, dusty left the woman she was with and went crazy – i found out afterwards that she’s very territorial when she is with somebody. her tail was flapping wildly and, at first, i thought it was a display but, then, i realized she was angry. i knew i had to get out of the water so i swam towards the pier but, within seconds, dusty had crashed into me with her snout. it was very powerful and painful, and the speed was amazing. i was pushed forwards violently.all the people on the pier were staring down at me open-mouthed. dusty was still in the water beside me, her tail flapping crazily. that was more frightening than anything: i thought, if she hits me with her tail, i could go under and drown.i was at the pier but couldn’t get out because of my injuries. i felt pure terror. i shouted for help and a guy put his arm in and pulled me out on to the steps. then, another man appeared and said he was an orthopaedic surgeon. he had been driving into doolin when he saw what was happening on the pier. i was so cold and very worried – i didn’t know how bad my injuries were and my biggest fear was internal bleeding. he checked me over and said he couldn’t feel any evidence of bleeding but that i probably had broken bones. i found out later that i had six spinal fractures, three broken ribs and a damaged lung.i was in hospital for five days and off work for five months with limited mobility and pain. then, i was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress. my near-death experience had left me anxious about everything. i felt that people were looking at me in the wrong way, i began to struggle with loud noises and i suffered from memory loss. three months before the accident, i had opened a health-food shop but i had to let it go because i could no longer work.it was the hardest year ever but, now, it’s all behind me. i had therapy, osteopathy and massage, and am building up my own osteopathy practice now. i have a new empathy with patients because i have been one.i am grateful that i am healthy and i really want to prevent other people being injured. we have this lovely idea about dolphins and have faith in them – who would think a dolphin would ever attack a person? if you see a fierce animal coming towards you with its teeth bared, it’s scary, but dolphins have this lovely, wide smile.i don’t have any anger towards dusty. i respect her. but i was in her territory and she’s a wild, unpredictable animal. people need to know that. so many come here to swim with her and they don’t understand how dangerous it can be. several other people were injured that summer.after the man pulled me out of the water, dusty swam away but, then, she came back and was looking at me. our eyes met and i felt there was complete remorse in her. she was a totally different dolphin; the anger had gone. the people on the pier were in awe. when she had that little moment with me, that was the end of the terror. i made my peace with her.
intermediate	according to a new scientific study, temperature rises caused by uncontrolled global warming could be at the high end of current estimates. the scientist who led the research said that, unless emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced, the planet will heat up by a minimum of 4c by 2100. this is twice the level the worldõs governments consider to be dangerous.the research indicates that fewer clouds form as the planet warms, which means less sunlight is reflected back into space. this forces temperatures up even higher. the way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change.professor steven sherwood, at the university of new south wales in australia, who led the new work, said that the study broke new ground in two ways. first, it identified what controls the cloud changes and, second, it rejected the lowest estimates of future global warming and favoured the higher and more damaging estimates.ò4c would be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous,ó sherwood said. òfor example, it would make life difficult, if not impossible, in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the greenland ice sheet and some of the antarctic ice sheetó, with sea levels rising by many metres as a result.the research reduces the uncertainty about how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions, according to scientists commenting on the study, published in the journal nature. experts at japanõs national institute for environmental studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was òconvincingó and agreed that this indicated future climate change would be greater than expected.scientists measure the sensitivity of the earthõs climate to greenhouse gases by estimating the temperature rise that would be caused by a doubling of co2 in the atmosphere compared with pre-industrial levels ð which is likely to happen within 50 years. for two decades, those estimates have run from 1.5c to 5c:  wide range. the new research narrowed that range down to between 3c and 5c, by closely examining the biggest cause of uncertainty: clouds.computer climate models are the only tool researchers have to predict future temperatures and it was important to make sure that the way clouds are formed was represented accurately in those models. when water evaporates from the oceans, the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight; or, it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds. in reality, both processes happen and climate models that included the second possibility predicted significantly higher future temperatures than models that only included the nine-mile-high clouds.òclimate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the first to admit they are not perfect,ó said sherwood. òbut what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by the models that predict less warming, not those that predict more.ó he added: òsceptics may also point to the ôhiatusõ of temperatures since the end of the 20th century, but there is increasing evidence that this hiatus is not seen in other measures of the climate system and is almost certainly temporary.óglobal average air temperatures have increased quite slowly since a high point in 1998, which was caused by the ocean phenomenon el nin_o. but, observations show that heat is continuing to be trapped in increasing amounts by greenhouse gases, with over 90% disappearing into the oceans. furthermore, a study in november 2013 suggested the òpauseó may be mainly an illusion ð a result of the lack of temperature readings from polar regions, where warming is greatest.sherwood accepts his teamõs work on the role of clouds cannot definitely rule out that future temperature rises will be at the lower end of projections. but, for that to be the case, there would need to be some major missing ingredient for which there is currently no evidence. he added that a 4c rise in global average temperatures would have a serious impact on the world and the economies of many countries if emissions were not reduced.
intermediate	a canadian man who became famous because he offered a free round-the-world trip to a woman with the same name as his ex-girlfriend has returned from the trip with his chosen namesake. unfortunately, to the disappointment of those following the story, the two of them did not fall in love. jordan axani, a 28-year-old toronto charity founder, arrived back in canada with elizabeth quinn gallagher and said the pair had “a brother-sister-like relationship”.axani had made headlines in 2014 because he offered an air ticket to any canadian named elizabeth gallagher. he had booked a three-week vacation with his girlfriend but they split up and he was unable to change the name on the flight tickets.that’s where axani’s new travelling companion, a 23-year-old student from cole harbour, nova scotia, enters the story. elizabeth gallagher, who calls herself quinn, replied to an online posting from axani and she was chosen. gallagher explained before the trip that she had a “pretty serious” boyfriend. but that had not stopped journalists from hoping the globetrotters might fall for one another. unfortunately, it did not happen.“i’m going to be very clear,” axani said, soon after the pair returned to toronto. “this was never a romantic endeavour. it was strictly platonic. i do not think of quinn in a romantic way at all. there is no future for us romantically. she is a good friend. i think of her as a little sister and that is it. and our feelings are entirely mutual.”it took work to create that brother-sister, good-friend relationship, however. “it wasn’t easy and it certainly wasn’t immediate. it took us about a week to really figure each other out,” axani said. there was a certain amount of stumbling around as the pair got to know each other “about the dos and don’ts of travelling together. at the end of it, we’d developed a really great rhythm – one second, we had really funny inside jokes and, the next second, we knew when the other person needed space.”although the pair did not fall in love, axani said the trip, which included milan, venice, vienna, prague, khao lak (in thailand) and hong kong, was “fantastic”. a favourite place was prague, axani said, where they met more people than anywhere else on the trip.“over the course of two and a half days i think we met about two dozen people. so that’s a lot of stories, that’s a lot of individuals and that’s a lot of love for their home city of prague.”people were following the pair on twitter and instagram, axani said, and they were even recognized in the street in hong kong. “it was a real adventure. we had a blast. we learned a lot about ourselves and about each other. i can’t imagine it going much better than it did.”axani arrived back in toronto at 3am and went straight into a meeting at his charity, a ticket forward. axani started the non-profit organization after his internet post went viral. he wants to offer round-the-world-trips to survivors of abuse, cancer and war.apart from that, axani is also discussing making his story into a television show or film, he said. but he would not comment on what form those productions might take. “i’ll only say that there’s been lots of interest from many production companies. we’re well advanced.” in terms of his love life, axani said he was not looking for his next elizabeth gallagher yet. “i’m not looking for anything but life happens and we’ll see,” he said. “as always, life’s a journey.”
intermediate	some cities have pigeons. lima has black vultures. they fly in groups overhead and sit on the city’s buildings. in many ways, with their wrinkly heads and beady eyes, they remind lima residents of the side of their city they would rather ignore: the poverty and filth.but these birds’ taste for dead and decaying things has become a virtue. environmental authorities are kitting the birds out with gopro video cameras and gps trackers – the birds have a new mission in the fight against fly-tipping and illegal dumping.samuel is one of the project’s ten disease-free black vultures that are looking for rubbish. fitted with his tracker, he is set free above the city, where he identifies secret or hidden dumps and records the gps coordinates on a live map.his trainer at lima’s huachipa zoo, alfredo correa, is full of admiration. “they can eat dead animals because their bodies protect them from viruses and bacteria,” he says. “they’ve got some of the strongest gut flora in the natural world.”usaid and the peruvian environment ministry are working together on this project to tackle lima’s rubbish problem. a tongue-in-cheek video adds a melodramatic voiceover, in which the noble vultures are fighting disease, while humans ignore the danger.the project makes a serious point. with just four landfills in a city of nearly ten million inhabitants, there are many illegal dumps. a fifth of the rubbish goes into these dumps, according to the environment ministry. the waste contaminates lima’s main water source, the rimac river, as well as the chillon and lurin rivers, which flow into the bay of lima.the environmental supervision agency, oefa, says that three poorer neighbourhoods have only 12% of lima’s population but have by far the most fly-tipped rubbish: villa maria del triunfo (39.4%), villa el salvador (25.3%) and el agustino (18.3%).part of the problem is unpaid taxes. many residents just don’t pay. that means some of the 43 district municipalities don’t have enough money for basic services such as rubbish collection.it also means nobody is necessarily going to clean up where the vultures identify illegal trash. “we share the vulture’s gps coordinates with the municipalities,” says javier hernandez, the project director. “it’s their job to collect the rubbish and to try and change the habits of their residents.”the project aims to encourage residents to be “vultures on the ground”: to report fly-tipping, cut back on their own waste and recycle. some residents are responding, posting photos of illegal dumps on the twitter feed and facebook page.nannan
intermediate	angry waiters are asking for public support in a battle to keep their tips. pizzaexpress branches are to be targeted by protesters, in an attempt to get the restaurant chain to stop taking a proportion of tips for staff that have been paid on credit and debit cards. campaigners have also started an online petition in the hope that restaurant-goers will support their demands.pizzaexpress keeps, as an admin fee, 8p out of every £1 paid when tips are given by card. this is a policy that has made some employees angry. the chain, which has 430 branches around the uk and is particularly popular with families, makes around £1m a year from the practice, according to the union unite.òwe believe this 8% fee is unfair and that, if the chain values its staff, it should be paying them the total tips they are given by customers,ó said chantal chegrinec of unite. òwe are starting with pizzaexpress but they are not the only ones and we will turn our attention to other companies after this.óthe protests are being organized by local branches of unite. the  rst is taking place at the british museum branch of pizzaexpress in london. the union has also written to the restaurant chainõs ceo. unite began the campaign following a survey of its pizzaexpress members after the chain was sold to a chinese company in 2014. one of the top issues was the 8% deduction from their tips.one disgruntled pizzaexpress employee, who wants to remain anonymous, said that the admin fee was costing her £3 a night. òi have worked at pizzaexpress for 15 years,ó she said in a letter to unite. òafter all this time, iõm still only paid the national minimum wage of £6.50 an hour. so you see my colleagues and i are very reliant on customer tips to top up our low wages. i work hard and am good at my job but, when pizzaexpress thinks it can get away with taking a percentage of our hard-earned tips left on a card, i get upset.óask and zizzi, two other restaurant chains, also deduct 8% of the tips paid by card. but other chains deduct even more. cafe_ rouge, bella italia and belgo deduct 10%; so do strada and giraffe.a spokesperson for pizzaexpress said that its admin charge was to cover the cost of running a òtroncó ð a pay arrangement used to distribute tips among staff. òwe made big efforts to set up this tronc system, which is run by staff. they independently decide how tips made by electronic card payment are distributed between the restaurant teams; it is a system run by employees for the employees,ó she said.the chain, which sells 29m pizzas a year in its uk restaurants, denied that it pro ts from the admin fee. but other restaurant groups do not deduct an admin fee from tips. wagamama, pizza hut and tgi friday all take nothing. frankie & bennyõs, chiquitos and garfunkels used to charge 10% but they stopped doing this several years ago.unite recently targeted ten pizzaexpress restaurants in south london ð they distributed lea ets to customers who were òshocked and disgustedó by the practice. pizzaexpress says the charge is mentioned in small print at the bottom of its menus. but the employee who wrote to unite said that, when she mentioned the charge to customers, they were always surprised. most customers would then pay the tip in cash. almost 6,000 people have signed uniteõs online petition.one waiter, who doesnõt work for pizzaexpress but has worked for 11 years for another restaurant chain, said that at least a third of his income is from tips. he doesnõt want to be identi ed because he is scared there will be reprisals. òi work in a busy london branch and, on an average night, i serve 150 people and earn £40 to £50 in tips,ó he says. òthat might sound like a lot but that money is crucial to me because my basic pay is only £6.50 an hour.óconservative mp andrew percy has asked for a change in the law that would give restaurant staff more control over tips. he said he plans to raise the issue in parliament.ó
intermediate	the moroccan city of ouarzazate is used to big productions. it is on the edge of the sahara desert and at the centre of the north african countryõs òouallywoodó  lm industry, where scenes from movies such as lawrence of arabia, the mummy, the living daylights and even game of thrones were  lmed.now the city, known as the òdoor of the desertó, is the centre for a complex of four linked solar mega- plants, which, together with hydro and wind, will help provide nearly half of moroccoõs electricity from renewable energy by 2020. the project is a key part of moroccoõs ambitions to use its deserts to become a global solar superpower.when the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world. the  rst phase, called noor 1, will be ready in november 2015. the mirror technology it uses is less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that you can see on roofs all over the world. but it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down.the potential for solar power from the desert has been known for decades. in the days after the chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, the german particle physicist gerhard knies calculated that the worldõs deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to provide power for all the people in the world for a whole year. but the challenge is to capture that energy and take it to where it is needed.as engineers  nish noor 1, its 500,000 moon-shaped solar mirrors glitter in the desert. the 800 rows follow the sun across the sky, whirring quietly every few minutes.when they are  nished, the four plants at ouarzazate will need a space as big as moroccoõs capital city, rabat, and generate 580 mega-watts of electricity, enough to power a million homes.moroccoõs environment minister, hakima el-haite, believes that solar energy could have the same effects on the region this century that oil production had in the last century. but the $9bn project was triggered by more immediate concerns, she said.òwe import 94% of our energy as fossil fuels from other countries and that has big consequences for our state budget,ó el-haite told the guardian. òso, when we heard about the possibilities of solar energy, we thought, ôwhy not?õósolar energy will make up a third of moroccoõs renewable energy supply by 2020. wind and hydro will make up the other two-thirds.òwe are very proud of this project,ó el-haite said. òi think it is the most important solar plant in the world.ótechnicians say that the noor 2 and 3 plants, due to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours ð this gives the possibility of 24/7 solar energy in the sahara and the surrounding region.the  rst part of the project is nearly completed and morocco has bigger international ambitions. we are already involved in transportation lines to cover the full south of morocco and mauritania, says ahmed baroudi, manager of societe dinvestissements energetiques, the national renewable energy investment  rm. but he says the projects effects will go further  even as far as the middle east.exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the moroccan solar energy agency (masen). morocco is making plans with tunisia and energy exports northwards across the mediterranean are a key goal.òwe believe that itõs possible to export energy to europe but,  rst, we have to build the interconnectors which donõt yet exist,ó said maha el-kadiri, a masen spokeswoman.in the meantime, morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs. this could one day include water desalination, which is very useful in a country that is having more and more droughts as the climate warms.about $9bn has been invested in the noor complex, much of it from international institutions such as the european investment bank and world bank and supported by moroccan government guarantees. energy subsidies from moroccoõs king mohammed vi have stopped the cost from being transferred to normal people.over a thousand, mostly moroccan, workers are still racing to  x electric wires, take down scaffolding and insulate steel pipelines. they hurry past in yellow and orange safety vests, working 12-hour shifts beneath the atlas mountains. they wear hard hats, safety shoes and ear plugs.òweõve done the construction and, now, we will see how these projects look when they start,ó says hajar lakhael, a 25-year-old environment and security manager from meknes. òit is exactly like the preparation for a grand performance.óa global audience will be watching with interest.nannannannannannan
intermediate	at addis ababa airport, visitors are greeted by pictures of golden grains, tiny red seeds and a group of men around a giant pancake. the words say: “teff: the ultimate gluten-free crop!”ethiopia is one of the world’s poorest countries, well known for its difficult food situation. but it is also the home of teff, a highly nutritious ancient grain that is now being sold in health-food shops and supermarkets in europe and america.teff’s tiny seeds – the size of poppy seeds – are high in calcium, iron and protein, and also amino acids. naturally gluten free, the grain can be used instead of wheat flour in anything from bread and pasta to waffles and pizza bases. like quinoa, the andean grain, teff’s superb nutritional profile offers the promise of new and lucrative markets in the west.in ethiopia, teff is a national obsession. grown by around 6.3 million farmers, fields of the crop cover more than 20% of all farmland. it is ground into flour and used to make injera, the flatbread that is basic to ethiopian cooking. the grain is also central to many religious and cultural ceremonies. across the country, and in neighbouring eritrea, people gather around large pieces of injera, which is also used as cutlery, scooping up stews and feeding one another as a sign of loyalty or friendship – a tradition known as gursha.the growing appetite for traditional crops and the booming health-food and gluten-free markets are breathing new life into the grain, which is increasingly being called ethiopia’s “second gift to the world”, after coffee.sophie kebede, a london-based businesswoman who owns a uk company specializing in the grain, says she was “flabbergasted” when she discovered its nutritional value. “i didn’t know it was so sought after. i am of ethiopian origin; i’ve been eating injera all my life.”growing demand for so-called ancient grains has not always been a simple positive for poor communities. in bolivia and peru, there are reports of rising incomes from the now-global quinoa trade, but also malnutrition and conflicts over land, as farmers sell their entire crop to meet western demand.ethiopia’s growing middle class is also increasing demand for teff and rising prices have made the grain too expensive for the poorest people. today, most small farmers sell most of what they grow to people in the city.this may have helped boost incomes in some rural areas but it has had nutritional consequences, says the government, as teff is the most nutritionally valuable grain in the country. in urban areas, people eat up to 61kg of teff a year. in rural areas, the figure is 20kg. the type of teff people eat is different, too: the rich eat the more expensive magna and white teff varieties; poorer people usually eat less-valuable red and mixed teff and more than half combine it with cheaper cereals such as sorghum and maize.the ethiopian government wants to double teff production by 2015. it says that the grain could play an important role in school meals and emergency aid programmes, and help reduce malnutrition – particularly among children and adolescents.though ethiopia has a fast-growing economy, it remains on the un’s list of least-developed countries. an estimated 20% of under-fives are malnourished.the government’s agricultural transformation agency aims to boost crops by developing improved varieties of the grain and introducing new planting techniques and tools.the government does not allow the export of raw teff grain, only of injera and other processed products. but this could change: the goal is to produce enough teff for ethiopia and for export.mama fresh is a family company that has been selling injera to top restaurants and hotels in the ethiopian capital for years. it also exports the flatbread to finland, germany, sweden and the us, mostly for ethiopians who live there. but, the company wants to double exports to america in 2014 and will soon start producing teff-based pizzas, bread and cookies.regassa feyissa, an ethiopian agricultural scientist and former head of the national institute for biodiversity, warns that, without careful planning, increased teff production for export may mean that farmers do not grow other important crops.with not much ethiopian teff on the international market, farmers in the us have started planting the crop. farmers in europe, israel and australia have also experimented with it.nannan
intermediate	organic food has more of the antioxidants linked to better health than regular food, and lower levels of toxic metals and pesticides, according to the most comprehensive scienti c analysis so far. the international team behind the work suggests that switching to organic fruit and vegetables could give the same bene ts as adding one or two portions of the recommended ô ve a dayõ fruit and vegetables.the team, led by professor carlo leifert, concludes that there are òstatistically signi cantó differences, with a range of antioxidants being òsubstantially higheró ð between 19% and 69% ð in organic food. it is the  rst study to demonstrate clear differences between organic and conventional fruits, vegetables and cereals.the researchers say the increased levels of antioxidants are equivalent to òone to two of the  ve portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be signi cant in terms of human nutritionó.the  ndings will add to the controversy over organic food and whether it is better for people. tom sanders, a professor of nutrition at kingõs college london, said the research did show some differences. òbut the question is are they within natural variation? and are they nutritionally relevant? i am not convinced.ó he added, òleifert has had a lot of disagreements with a lot of people.ó he also said that research showed organic cereals have less protein than conventional crops.the results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 studies from around the world ð more than ever before ð which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit, vegetables and cereals. òthe important thing about this research is that it shatters the myth that how we farm does not affect the quality of the food we eat,ó said helen browning, chief executive of the soil association, which campaigns for organic farming.leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants òhave previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancersó. the researchers also found much higher levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, in conventional crops. pesticide residues were found on conventional crops four times more often than on organic food.the research is certain to be criticized: the inclusion of so many studies in the analysis could mean poor-quality work makes the results unreliable. also, the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in conventional produce were still far below recommended limits. but, the researchers say cadmium accumulates over time in the body and that some people may wish to avoid this, and that pesticide limits are set individually, not for the cocktail of chemicals used on crops.a further criticism of the research is that the differences seen may result from different climates, soil types and crop varieties, and not from organic farming. the greatest criticism, however, will be over the suggestions of possible health bene ts. the most recent major analysis, which included 223 studies in 2012, found little evidence. òthe published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are signi cantly more nutritious than conventional foods,ó it found.this was also the conclusion of earlier, smaller studies published in 2009 in a scienti c journal and by the uk food standards agency. the 2012 study did note that eating organic food might help people avoid pesticide residues. sanders said he was not persuaded by the new work. òyou are not going to be healthier if you eat organic food,ó he said. òwhat is most important is what you eat, not whether itõs organic or conventional. itõs whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all.óopinion polls show healthy eating (55%) and avoiding chemical residues (53%) are key reasons given by shoppers for buying organic produce. but, many also say care for the environment (44%) and animal welfare (31%) are important, and also taste (35%). browning said: òthis research con rms what people think about organic food. in other countries, there have, for a long time, been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming. we hope these  ndings will bring the uk into line with the rest of europe.ónan
intermediate	sweden is the best country for older people, afghanistan the worst – but the general wealth of a country does not always mean better conditions for the over-60s, according to the first global index on ageing. sweden’s top ranking – followed by norway, germany, the netherlands and canada – is predictable, but the global agewatch index provides some surprising results.the us, the world’s richest country, is only in eighth place, while the uk is 13th. sri lanka is 36th, far above pakistan at 89th, despite similar levels of gross domestic product (gdp). bolivia and mauritius score higher than the size of their economies may suggest and, while brazil and china are relatively high on the index, india and russia are much lower.“this survey shows that history counts,” said mark gorman, director of helpage international. “the top-ranked countries are what you would expect, but scandinavian countries were not wealthy when they introduced pensions for everyone. the older population in sri lanka today is benefiting from good basic education and health care – those countries made certain policy choices. everybody has scarce resources, but they should not forget that, when they make investment decisions, they should also consider issues of old age.”the index, developed with the un fund for population and development, covers 91 countries and 89% of the world’s older people. the survey comes during a major demographic change: by 2050, there are expected to be two billion people aged 60 and over, making up more than a fifth of the world’s population.population ageing – when older people form an increasingly large proportion of people – is happening fastest in developing countries. more than two-thirds of older people live in poor countries; by 2050, this proportion is expected to be about four-fifths. the fastest ageing countries – jordan, laos, mongolia, nicaragua and vietnam – are in the lower half of the ranking, which suggests that politicians there need to look at the question of ageing if they are to provide enough support to their populations.there are gender differences among ageing populations, with women generally living longer than men. in 2012, for every 84 men aged 60 and over, there were 100 women. many women face disadvantages in old age because of lack of paid work (and therefore also savings), less decision-making power in the family and the fact that they are vulnerable to violence.however, population ageing does not always lead to significantly higher health care spending, according to the report, which highlights the importance of long-term investments in education and health care for older people. bolivia, ranked 46, despite being one of the poorest countries, has introduced good policies for older people, with a national plan on ageing, free health care and a noncontributory pension for everyone.good basic health care introduced decades ago in chile and costa rica has helped the ageing populations of those countries. a good education system is of great benefit later in life – basic literacy is crucial for older people as they deal with the pensions paperwork. in the philippines, older people have benefited from the educational reforms introduced after independence in 1946, which made elementary and high school education compulsory. the same is true for armenia, which, like other countries of the former soviet union, benefited from a strong education system. south korea came a surprisingly low 67 on the ageing index, partly because it introduced a pension only recently.the ageing index is calculated using 13 indicators under four headings: income security, health care, employment and education, and a positive environment. all indicators have equal weight, except for pension income coverage, life expectancy at 60, healthy life expectancy at 60 and psychological well-being. these categories have increased importance because of better data quality and countries were included only if there was enough data.professor sir richard jolly, creator of the human development index, said: “this groundbreaking index helps us to better understand the needs and opportunities of older people thanks to its pioneering application of human development methodology. it challenges countries in every part of the world to raise their sights as to what is possible.”nan
intermediate	governments across europe dream of  nding a magic solution to rising unemployment. but, in the hardest-hit parts of the eu, unemployment continues to rise and the talk does little to reduce the number of people without work.now, in a corner of italy, one mayor thinks he has found an answer to his townõs serious lack of work. valter piscedda, the mayor of elmas, a small town near sardiniaõs capital, cagliari, wants to pay residents to leave. the council will pay for ten unemployed locals to take intensive english lessons, get on a cheap  ight and look for jobs elsewhere in europe.òthis idea is a result of common sense and experience,ó the mayor told the guardian. òover the past year and a half ð especially in the past few months ð i have been seeing young people, almost every day, who are despairing about their search for work. some ask for help in  nding it here. others have tried everything and are so discouraged that they no longer want to stay and wait. and they want to go and gain work experience abroad; life experience, too.òso, my idea was this: put everything in place so that those who want to gain experience abroad are able to,ó he said.as the national economy continues to falter, sardinia, along with much of southern and central italy, is struggling with high unemployment. unemployment was at 17.7% in the second quarter of 2014, according to italyõs national institute of statistics, istat. more than 54% of people under 25 are out of work.for the adesso parto (now iõm leaving) programme, elmasõs council will give û12,000 on a  rst-come,  rst-served basis to applicants aged between 18 and 50. they just have to be out of work and have lived in the town for three years. they do not have to be university educated and their annual income must be no more than û15,000.the idea of encouraging people to leave is sensitive at a time when huge numbers of italians ð many of them bright young graduates ð are leaving their country every year. but piscedda, who belongs to the democratic party of the prime minister, matteo renzi, believes that the people he is sending away might return òand give me back 100 times what they were givenó. more importantly, he wants the scheme to help those most in need.òitõs a programme for those with no other resource; itõs the last-chance saloon. it will allow them the dignity of not having to ask a friend for money or put burdens on families,ó he said.earlier in 2014, he added, the council launched a scheme for businesses ð they were given  nancial incentives to hire young workers from elmas. òwe advertised 20 of these positions,ó he said. òwe got 120 applications.óin elmas, the scheme has got mixed reactions. òthe reality is that there is little work here,ó said alessandro macis. òthe opportunity to go abroad to learn about the workplace and experience other cultures can be very worthwhile. the son of a friend of mine who didnõt study much is in london and heõs really  nding his way. he started as a waiter. now, heõs a cook and heõs learning english.óothers were perplexed. i heard about it but i thought it was strange. if you have that money to pay for people to go away, why dont you use that money to keep them here? said consuelo melis, who works behind the bar in a local cafe. on twitter, one of many reactions was disbelief. the states admission of defeat, commented marco patavino. institutions are raising the white  ag, remarked carlo mazzaggio.piscedda, however, says of his online critics: òprobably, they are people that arenõt in need ... every day, i deal with peopleõs problems and i have to do something to try to solve them. these people, if they had an alternative, they wouldnõt be asking for help.òthe work i can create, as mayor, is temporary. i can have a piazza cleaned. i can have it cleaned again. i can have the streets cleaned. but these are all temporary things that give nothing beyond that little bit of money for a few months. i want to go beyond that.ó
elementary	in summer, in the arctic regions of canada, the sun shines for more than 20 hours a day. some people enjoy this after the constant darkness of winter. but, for the small muslim community of iqaluit, life in the land of the midnight sun is a real challenge during the month of ramadan, when muslims fast from sunrise to sunset.“i haven’t fainted once,” said 29-year-old abdul karim, one of only a few muslims in the area who has carefully timed his ramadan fast to the arctic sun. this year, that means he eats at about 1.30am before the sun rises and breaks his fast at about 11pm when the sun sets. “i would only stop if it hurt my health,” karim said.most muslims in iqaluit follow the timetable that muslims in ottawa, about 1,300 miles south, follow. this follows the advice of muslim scholars who have said muslims in the far north should observe ramadan using the timetable of mecca or the nearest muslim city. they still have to fast for around 18 hours a day, said atif jilani, who moved to iqaluit from toronto. “the days are long, but we can do it.”it’s a similar situation in all of canada’s most northern mosques during ramadan, where muslims have to live with very long or very short days. in recent years, much of the community has chosen to follow the ramadan timetable of edmonton, in alberta. some follow the timetable of mecca, for example awan, a father of two young children, including a 12-year-old who recently started fasting. he hopes that the easier timetable will encourage his son – it means about 15 hours of fasting, not 18 hours like in edmonton. “if i fast edmonton times, my son might say, ‘papa, you are really insane. what are you doing?’” he said.for the 100 muslims in inuvik, a small town 125 miles north of the arctic circle, it is impossible to follow the local movements of the sun. they also follow edmonton’s timetable. “we currently have 24 hours a day of sun,” said ahmad alkhalaf. “there’s no sunrise or sunset.” people already followed the edmonton timetable in 2001 when he moved from toronto to the small northern town of 3,500 people. “my first ramadan here was in december. there’s no sun at that time; it’s dark all day and night. so we used edmonton time.”sometimes, it can be difficult to follow the clock and not the sun, alkhalaf said. “we should break our fast when it’s dusk but we eat when the sun is up. it’s not usual to have iftar [the meal that breaks the fast] when the sun is up,” he said.in inuvik, where most of the population is inuit, the muslim community has tried to find a balance between ramadan and the local culture and traditions. the iftar meal includes curries and also local meat such as reindeer. “we make a soup or curry, but we don’t use beef, we use reindeer.”in iqaluit, this ramadan has been one of the most difficult of recent years because it includes some of the longest days of the year. it’s particularly true for people like karim who have followed the local sunrise and sunset carefully. but, it will be easier for him to fast in future years, he says, thanks to the lunar calendar. ramadan will then fall during winter and, in iqaluit, the sun will rise and set within a few hours each day. “i’ll follow those hours, too,” he said with a laugh. “oh yes!”nannannannan
elementary	more than 100,000 people went onto the streets in brazil to show their anger at violent police, poor public services and high costs for the world cup.the demonstrations in rio de janeiro, são paulo, brasilia, belem, belo horizonte and salvador started peacefully, but there were some clashes with police and people set fire to cars and buses.people complained that police used rubber bullets, tear gas and violent beatings.happening at the start of the football confederations cup, the rallies brought together people who are angry with the high costs and poor quality of public services, the large amounts of money spent on international sporting events, low standards of health care, inequality and corruption.most of the demonstrations were peaceful, but several police were hurt, at least one car was burned and windows were broken.people were demonstrating for different reasons. “we are here because we hate the government. they do nothing for us,” said oscar josé santos, 19 years old.“i’m an architect but i have been unemployed for six months. there must be something wrong with this country,” said nadia al husin.at a smaller rally in brasilia, demonstrators entered the high-security area of the national congress. several climbed onto the roof.in belo horizonte, police clashed with protesters who tried to get into a football stadium, where there was a confederations cup match between nigeria and tahiti.in porto alegre, demonstrators set fire to a bus and, in curitiba, protesters tried to enter the office of the state governor. there were also rallies in belem, salvador and other places.in são paulo, there were large groups of people but the marches were peaceful.most protesters were young and, for many, it was their first experience of such a giant rally. “my generation has never experienced this,” said thiago firbida, a student. “since the dictatorship, brazilians have never demonstrated like this. they did not believe they had a reason to. but now brazil once again has problems, with a constant rise in prices, so people are finally reacting.”brazil’s demonstrations have been given special names – the “vinegar revolution” (because police arrested people for carrying vinegar to stop the effects of tear gas), the “20-cent revolution” (because of the bus price rise) and the passe livre (because of the demand for free public transport).some said the protests did not feel brazilian but they were liberating. “our politicians need to see the strength we have as one people. brazilians are usually too nice; they enjoy partying, not protesting, but something is changing,” said deli borsari, a 53-year-old yoga teacher.after people heard about the costs of new and improved stadiums on the news, the confederations cup football tournament has been one of the reasons for the protests. before saturday’s match in brasilia, groups of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police. frightened japanese supporters ran from the area holding their children, when they heard shots – perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas.another protest march, near rio’s maracana stadium, also had a heavy police response.president dilma rousseff “believes peaceful protests are correct and proper for a democracy and that it is natural for young people to demonstrate.”but people booed the president at the opening ceremony for the confederations cup. she will have serious political problems, both now and in 2014, when brazil will host the world cup and also have an election.nannannannan
elementary	prince harry has left afghanistan at the end of a four-month tour. he spoke about the frustrations of being a royal who doesn’t want a lot of public attention.he also talked about his feelings for some parts of the media and described how his father constantly told him to behave more like a member of the royal family.as a commander of an apache helicopter, the prince said he had shot at the taliban. he said he was only doing his job.in interviews during his time based at camp bastion in helmand province, the prince, known as captain wales in the army, explained his ‘three mes’. “one in the army, one socially in my own private time and one with the family.”he admitted he sometimes disappointed people and also himself with his silly behaviour. he said he was “probably too much army and not enough prince”, but he said he was entitled to privacy, too.in another interview, he criticized the media, especially the sun, the daily mail and the daily telegraph. he said he was very annoyed by articles that compare his role as an apache co-pilot gunner to spitfire crews during the second world war. “no, it’s not like that at all,” he said.the prince said he didn’t like the media because of the treatment of his family when “i was very small”. he said that he read the stories written about him. “of course i read them,” the prince said. “if there’s a story and somebody writes something about me, i want to know what they said. but it just upsets me and makes me angry that people can write those things. not just about me, but about everything and everybody. my father always says, ‘don’t read it’.”when he was asked if he felt more comfortable being captain wales than prince harry, his reply was revealing. “definitely. i’ve always been like that. my father’s always trying to tell me about who i am and things like that. but it’s very easy to forget about who i am when i am in the army. everyone’s wearing the same uniform and doing the same kind of thing. i get on well with the lads and i enjoy my job. it really is as simple as that.”before he went to afghanistan, the prince was photographed naked in las vegas at a private party. harry said he had disappointed himself and other people, but also blamed the media. “at the end of the day i was in a private area and there should be a certain amount of privacy that one should expect.”when he was asked why he and his brother liked helicopters, he said, “probably because you can only fit a few people in a helicopter, so no one can follow us, like you guys.”nannannan
elementary	there are about 50,000 mystery shopping trips every month in the uk. mystery shoppers pretend to be a customer in a store but they are really collecting information on the store and how good or bad its service is. the demand for mystery shoppers is growing because online shopping is becoming more popular.òretailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who visit a physical store want a service and an experience they canõt get online,ó says simon boydell, spokesman for marketforce, which has more than 300,000 mystery shoppers. òour clients want to know how well their stores are delivering on that experience.óòwe assign different store locations to each shopper and rotate them so that they never go back to the same shop within three months,ó says jill spencer of mystery shopping company aba. òeach day, they spend up to eight hours visiting  ve to ten stores, plus another hour or two writing detailed reports on every part of their visit.ó for that, the mystery shoppers can earn up to £155 a day. their expenses are also paid. mystery shoppers who  lm their visits with a hidden camera can earn even more ð around £300 a day.mystery shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy. òthey usually give me between £5 and £20 to spend at each store, to check the service i receive at the till,ó says mystery shopper laura. òiõm always given a speci c task, such as buying something from a speci c department or a new product range, but i can often buy whatever i want ð and keep it.ólike most full-time mystery shoppers, laura is self-employed. she earns around £30,000 to £40,000 a year and that doesnõt include all the freebies she gets on the job. òwith © macmillan publishers ltd 2014 news lessons / the secrets of the mystery shopper / elementary the perks, itõs enough to live on.ó she  nds it satisfying to return to a store where she has previously been a mystery shopper and see standards have improved. òi know it must be because of my feedback or why would they pay me to give it? i feel iõm not just doing a service for my company; iõm doing a service for all shoppers everywhere.ómore than 500,000 people have registered as mystery shoppers in the uk, but just 10% or less get regular work each month. this has led to a dramatic reduction in payment. before, people were paid and got travel expenses, but now òyou often just receive some money towards a purchase,ó say val, a 51-year-old former mystery shopper.nowadays, mystery shopping companies mostly give freebies as an incentive. òmarketforce shoppers usually get a couple of pounds for a visit, for their time and effort,ó says boydell. òat the most, weõll pay £15 to £25 plus expenses for a meal for two or a hotel stay, for example. we donõt directly employ any shoppers so we donõt have to pay them the minimum wage.óòiõd go on a cruise for nothing,ó says laura. òbut i think mystery shopping companies that pay you a nominal fee to travel to a restaurant and eat a meal are exploiting people. i wonõt do those jobs anymore.ó but there are plenty of people who want to do those jobs. hannah, a 41-year-old lawyer, has made nearly 500 visits for the mystery dining company in her spare time without receiving pay or travel expenses. she has enjoyed £200 meals at michelin- starred restaurants and overnight stays at expensive hotels.but, it can be hard work. hannah says she spends two to four hours after each visit writing detailed reports on everything from the quality of the food to speci c conversations with staff. and, she always needs to be able to name or describe the staff. she has to memorize all these details while eating her meal because she cannot openly write anything down.nannannan
elementary	a new computer-assisted autopsy system is becoming more and more popular in european hospitals. its inventor says that the system could mean that now there will be no such thing as a ‘perfect murder’.the method, called ‘virtopsy’, is being used at some forensic medical institutes in europe. it was invented by a group of scientists at the university of zurich. instead of cutting the chest, like in a traditional autopsy, pathologists are now able to examine the dead body in 3-d via computer screens.michael thali, the director of zurich’s institute for forensic medicine in europe, and one of the inventors of virtopsy, said it could completely change criminal investigations. “basically there will be no such thing as the perfect murder any more because a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence,” he said.virtopsies use powerful machines. together, the machines are called a ‘virtobot’. virtopsies can find injuries that are not seen during a traditional autopsy, as well as air pockets, heart attacks and even cancer.“the virtopsy could replace the autopsy one day,” said richard dirndorfer, one of the first people to use dna analysis in criminology. “i think we’ll see it happen slowly, just like dna analysis slowly replaced blood group analysis”.the method allows doctors to see deep inside dead bodies. it can see things that cannot be found during traditional autopsies.criminologists from around the world have been travelling to switzerland over the past few years to see the new method. forensic scientists and pathologists think the method can be used together with the traditional autopsy.“in order to analyze the colour of the blood, the thickness of body fluids or smells, we’ll need to use traditional autopsy methods,” said lars oesterhelweg, deputy director of the institute of forensic medicine at the charité hospital in berlin, which is using a version of the virtopsy.he added that the new method was very helpful in re-examining cases where the cause of death was unclear. “it means that investigations can be re-examined and we can try again to find the murderer,” he said.scientists said that relatives of the dead prefer the virtopsy method because, during a traditional autopsy, scientists have to cut and damage the dead body.nannan
elementary	a report by the world health organization (who) says that 35.6% of all women around the world will experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, usually from a male partner. the report says that 30% of women are attacked by their partners. it also says that a large percentage of murders of women – 38% – are done by their partners.the highest levels of violence against women are in africa, where nearly half of all women – 45.6% – will experience physical or sexual violence. in poor and middle-income europe, the percentage is 27.2%. but, richer countries are not always safer for women – a third of women in rich countries (32.7%) will experience violence. 42% of the women who experience violence have injuries, which doctors and nurses may notice. the report says that injuries are often the first opportunity to discover violence in the home and to offer the woman help. violence has a big effect on women’s health. some come to hospital with broken bones and others have problems related to pregnancy and mental illness.the who has two reports – one report is on violence; the other report tells doctors and nurses how to help women. dr claudia garcia-moreno, of the who, and professor charlotte watts, from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, wrote the reports.“for the first time we have compared data from all over the world on partner violence and sexual violence by non-partners and the effect of these sorts of violence on health,” said garcia-moreno. these included hiv and other sexually transmitted infections, depression, alcoholism, unwanted pregnancies and babies that are born too small.there were differences in the levels of violence against women in different regions of the world but, said garcia-moreno, “it is too high” everywhere. data from 81 countries shows that, even in rich countries, 23.2% of women will experience physical and/or sexual violence from a partner in their lives. the global figure for women attacked by partners was 30%.women report more sexual assaults and rapes by acquaintances or strangers in rich countries than elsewhere. the report says that 12.6% of women in wealthy countries will be sexually attacked by a non-partner in their lives. the percentage in africa is 11.9%.the report says that their previous research shows that better-educated women and working women are less likely to experience violence, but not in all regions. there is a need to change some attitudes, said watts. “in some societies, are certain forms of violence against women acceptable?” she asked. “in some societies, violence against women is not ok – but, in some societies, it is ok.”garcia-moreno said that the percentages show that we must pay more attention to this question. over the past ten years, more people see that there is a problem, she said, but “it is a complex problem. we don’t have a vaccine or a pill”.the who now recommends teaching doctors and nurses to recognize the signs of domestic violence and sexual assault. but they do not recommend asking every woman who arrives in a clinic if she has been the victim of violence.“if a woman comes back several times with injuries she doesn’t mention, you should ask her about domestic violence,” said garcia-moreno.nan
elementary	margaret thatcher, the most famous british prime minister since winston churchill, has died at the age of 87. she was in poor health for many years, suffering from dementia. the british government says that her funeral will be at st paul’s cathedral.the british prime minister, david cameron, said: “i was very sad when l heard of lady thatcher’s death. we’ve lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great briton.” he added: “she was our first woman prime minister – and she didn’t just lead our country, she saved our country.” he added that he believed she would be remembered as the greatest british peacetime prime minister.president barack obama said, “here in america, many of us will never forget her close friendship with president reagan.”margaret thatcher was the first woman leader of an important western state. she was prime minister for 11 years until members of her own party removed her in 1990.when they heard of her death, politicians from all parties sent tributes.british labour party leader, ed miliband, said: “she will be remembered as a unique person. she changed the politics of a whole generation. she was britain’s first woman prime minister. she was a huge figure in the world. the labour party disagreed with a lot of what she did, but we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength.”the former conservative prime minister, sir john major, said that people who worked closely with her would always remember her courage and determination in politics and her humanity and generous spirit in private.the “iron lady” was a close ally of the us president ronald reagan in the final years of the soviet union. the union broke up because of reforms introduced by mikhail gorbachev. he was the russian leader who thatcher liked and worked closely with. as a result, many ordinary people in ex-communist countries still think of her as someone who supported their freedom.it was a surprise when thatcher became party leader in 1975. within ten years, she had become famous around the world – people both admired and hated her – for her reforms in the uk and her strong beliefs in foreign policy. she had a long battle with the ira, which almost killed her with a bomb in 1984.in the uk, thatcher’s main economic policy was the denationalization of state-owned industry – the new word “privatization” became used in many countries. she also defeated militant trade unions, particularly the national union of miners, after a long and terrible strike that lasted almost a year. with money from britain’s north sea oil fields, she was able to change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies – including some members of her own party.as the british economy became healthy again after the problems that her policies caused, it seemed for a short time that no-one would ever defeat her. but, as her friends and supporters retired or were replaced, she started to make mistakes and became more and more unpopular. finally, in 1990, after a vote among conservative mps failed to support her, john major took control of the party.after she retired, she wrote her memoirs and continued to promote her values around the world.nannannannannan
elementary	imagine that you read a headline ‘fit in four minutes’ in a health magazine. would you believe it? well, dr izumi tabata’s training programme – 20 seconds of intensive effort, ten seconds of rest, repeat eight times – promises that it is possible to be fit with just 88 minutes of training a week.tabata remembers the first time he tested his training system on his university students in the early 1990s. “after four minutes’ hard exercise they were completely exhausted. they were almost dead! but after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised. we all were surprised.”tabata created his training programme after he watched japan’s speed skating team in the early 1990s. he saw that short bursts of very hard exercise were as effective as hours of normal exercise. tabata tried to prove this with a simple experiment. one group of students did an hour of cardiovascular exercise on an exercise bike five times a week. the other group did a ten-minute warm-up on the bike, then four minutes of tabata training, four times a week – plus one 30-minute session of exercise with two minutes of tabata.the results were very surprising. after six weeks of testing, the group who did tabata’s plan – exercising for just 88 minutes a week – increased their anaerobic capacity by 28% and their vo2 max by 15%. the other group, who trained for five hours every week, also improved their vo2 max, but only by 10%. but their training had no effect on their anaerobic capacity.but you have to work very, very hard. you can’t sit on a machine, chewing gum and reading hello! magazine. you have to do intensive bursts of activity on an exercise bike or rowing machine, explosive bodyweight exercises, sprints and so on. remember how you felt after doing a 100m sprint at school? imagine doing eight sprints with only a ten-second break between them.“full effort at 170% of your vo2 max is the basis of the programme,” says tabata. “if you feel ok afterwards you’ve not done it properly. the first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossible. in the original plan, we wanted eight repetitions, but some people could only do six or seven.”one person on an online forum wrote: “most people cannot do it correctly and they shouldn’t even try.” tabata doesn’t completely agree. “everyone can do it but beginners should start with educated trainers so that they don’t work too hard,” he explains. he also says that his programme burns an extra 150 calories in the 12 hours after exercise. most people use it to get fit or to get even fitter, but the programme also burns fat.so, it’s a little surprising that at the moment only serious athletes are doing the programme. this may change because tabata says there will soon be tabata instructors and a series of dvds at the end of the year. “i decided to do this because i often go on youtube and some people are doing it wrong because they don’t understand how hard they need to work,” says tabata.so, should we all start using tabata in our fitness programmes? richard scrivener, a former rugby fitness coach, says that you should not stop your usual training; tabata training is something extra. “runners, for example, need to run a lot of miles in their training,” he says. “but they could do fewer long runs by introducing tabata training. this will give their bodies the chance to rest and recover, especially if they have injuries.”gym fans can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three tabatas a week. and the rest of us can slowly increase the number of sessions, but we know that it will never get easier because every session needs maximum effort. that’s the programme: it is hard – but it works.nannan
elementary	he was a normal millionaire. he had a gold and silver rolex watch and lots of expensive cars. he liked to buy modern art. this chinese businessman had many companies and a large villa in madrid. but, he had almost no money in the bank. this interested the spanish authorities.gao ping sold goods to 4,000 chinese markets in spain. but, authorities suspected he was not paying taxes on the clothes, furniture and other goods he was bringing in from china.when police went to his warehouses in 2012, they found lots of cash: €100, €200 and €500 notes. police took away around €12m, the most cash ever found by spanish police.police have been worried about €500 notes for a long time. small and easy to transport, they are the favourite banknotes of criminals. the sum of €1m in €500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag. the same amount in €50 notes would need a small suitcase.the uk stopped using the €500 note in 2010 because they were used “almost entirely by criminals”. in 2009, italy’s central bank said that mafia money launderers and terrorists used the notes. canada got rid of its $1,000 note in 2000 because the police advised them to.these days, we have electronic payment systems and contactless cards so people are asking why it is still necessary to have these banknotes. peter sands, the former head of standard chartered bank, said we should get rid of large notes, including the €500, the $100, the 1,000 swiss franc note and the £50. sands said it was time to get rid of high-value notes that make life easier for “bad guys”. criminals would instead use smaller banknotes, or gold or diamonds, but these are big so criminals cannot carry them easily”, he said.the purple €500 note was introduced in 2002: it replaced the 1,000 deutschmark, the 10,000 belgian franc and the 500,000 italian lira. in germany and austria, people still pay with paper money and coins more than half the time.europol would like central banks to take more responsibility for what happens with €500 notes. eu finance ministers have asked banks and authorities to look at whether countries should limit high-value notes or get rid of them.nannannannan
elementary	we do not yet live in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm back to the future ii, but smartphones and other new technologies are creating exciting possibilities. experts agree that economic and population changes, new technology, and environmental concerns are having a big effect on transportation.with an ageing transport infrastructure, cities in the us have to change and improve their transportation. experts and scientists now realize that old ways of reducing traf c congestion arenõt enough to solve the problems of population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now an environmental problem.big us cities like los angeles and chicago are adding more bus lanes and pedestrian walkways, and expanding rail networks. at the same time, they are creating advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment.here are three of the key ideas that experts predict will change transportation in the future.connectivity taxi-sharing services like uber and apps like waze, which  nds the quickest routes for drivers, are completely changing how people move around and affecting the way traf c moves through a city. communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era.according to a recent study, people born in the 1990s are using cars less than older generations. according to the study, people born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than older generations did at the same time in their lives. and, people who still drive cars are experiencing less traf c thanks to waze.traf c congestion is improving in other ways, too. at the moment, a traf c light knows when a car is getting close but thatõs all. companies are developing technology that allows a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.automation we have known about driverless cars ever since google began testing the vehicles in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. but, there is already some automation of cars. automation will probably happen in stages:  rst, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: vehicles that are connected electronically and travel one behind another.the idea of a fully automated transportation system is interesting because it could improve safety ð peopleõs mistakes wonõt cause accidents any more. it could also help reduce carbon emissions and traf c congestion. but, it will take a long time to get fully automated because the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.to see what driverless cars might look like on the road, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.environmental concern the world is trying to slow down climate change and countries and cities are trying to reduce emissions. these things could have a big effect on the future of transportation and lead to zero- and low-emission vehicles and apps that encourage more walking, cycling and carpooling. when thinking about the future of transportation, itõs also important to think about why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. technologies that reduce the need for those trips ð for example, online meetings or online work ð could also have a big effect on transportation.nannannan
advanced	junior smart knows a lot about gangs. he is now 36 and his life can be divided into two distinct phases. he tells how in his late teens, after his mother died, he became drawn into a south london gang, which, at the time, helped fill a huge vacuum.“they became my new support group,” he says. “at first it was just a bit of fun but then it became more serious, more and more about making money. they got involved in criminality. that is how it was.” at school smart failed his gcses, then retook them at college and passed the lot. he secured a full-time job in administration and worked as a dj. but, on the side, he was making money illegally as part of the gang.eventually he was arrested for serious drug-related offences and was sent to prison for 12 years. instantly, he says, his sense of invincibility was shattered. “the first night after i was arrested was the biggest wake-up call of my life,” he says. “i had been living a dual life. i had been living as one person to my peers and another person to my peers’ enemies. i spent a long time sorting myself out.”today, junior smart runs a team of 12 full-time workers and six volunteers, which aims to turn young criminals and gang members away from crime. most of those working there are, like smart himself, ex-offenders. a few are still serving their sentences but are regarded as having reformed enough to be allowed out during the day to help. they work with the police, the probation service and other, voluntary organizations to help those who feel trapped and frightened in the violent criminal gangs that operate across london.for smart, the extraordinary journey from gang member to mentor began when he witnessed, from within, a prison system that was so obviously failing its inmates. he recalls a drug addict he befriended who, to his dismay, kept returning. “i was touched by the people who kept coming back in,” he says. “i couldn’t believe that nothing was being done about it. i was talking to the inmates and they knew what needed to be changed in their lives, but the problem is that the prison system only deals with the ‘index’ offence.”“one guy had a £300-a-week cocaine habit, which he funded through burglary. he would tell me stuff about how he would walk into a house, even when he knew people were there. so although he had a drug addiction, it never got dealt with. the thing that got me about that is that it is simply a revolving door.”that case and scores of others persuaded smart to start working as a prison “listener” – an inmate who helps reassure new arrivals and talks them through their first days inside. from there he developed what he calls his own “little plan” to run his own scheme once out of prison – using the experience of ex-offenders to help others reject the revolving door of prison life. he was released early, after five years. “at the end of my sentence i got an opportunity to put my little model into practice,” he says.so what does he think now? does he believe that, after the riots of last august, and the government’s promise to crack down on gangs, things are getting better? he is careful to offer some praise to the police and says much of their work in hauling in gang members has been good. but overall he is highly critical of a disjointed government approach that believes that, once the leader of a gang is arrested, the problem is solved. he agrees with the findings of a report that says the arrest of gang leaders can even make things worse. he says the effect of removing the leader is often to destabilize the entire gang.he draws a diagram of the hierarchy on a pad. “when you arrest the top guy, people start fighting for position all the way up. who was the most loyal? who had the most respect? it is a bit like a family. they are more likely to act out, through violence. it means that the arrest of the gang leaders has been nullified because it has not had a long-term effect. they have not even given the community a respite.”can it actually make the streets more dangerous? “it can do, because in the vacuum the recruitment and manipulation of young people becomes even more prevalent, creating new lower levels all the way down ... people take sides. if one gang or another territorial street network knows that an elder [leader] has been taken out, then they suddenly think that gang’s weak ... and so we have inter-estate disputes going on. and what happens when that elder is in prison? he forms alliances with other gang members, or when he gets released he then tries to retake control. that is when violence happens.”in order to spread risk down to the lowest levels, he says gangs are now recruiting far more in primary schools. the youngest members are called “tinies”. “over the last years we have seen more and more of this. the tinies can be as young as eight to eleven years old.” the young are brought in to shield their seniors from risk. it is often they who are charged with doing the street dealing or even the stabbing, he says.smart says that, with a lack of government funding and commitment to long-term rehabilitation, the challenges are immense, particularly in the current economic climate. “i try to engage a young person who has been earning £300 a week through illegal methods. it was hard before, to try to convince him. but with unemployment high and cuts to benefits, it makes things tougher.”that said, his project, which has well over 1,000 clients, is delivering results. fewer than 20% of those who come in for help reoffend. from personal experience, smart refuses to write off a single individual as beyond redemption and that is what drives him on. “i don’t think that about anybody,” he says.
advanced	barack obama has urged young people to reject pessimism and interact with those who have different beliefs if they want to make changes in the world.on the final day of his last visit to britain as us president, obama told 500 youth leaders at a town hall meeting in london: “i’m here to ask you to reject the notion there are forces we can’t control. as jfk said, our problems are manmade and can be solved by man.”“you’ve never had better tools to make a difference,” he told the a-level and uk–us exchange students at the q&a session. “reject pessimism, cynicism and know that progress is possible. progress is not inevitable; it requires struggle, discipline and faith.”but obama acknowledged the challenges faced by young people: “not to say your generation has had it easy, in a time of breathtaking change, from 9/11, 7/7 … and during an age of information and twitter where there’s a steady stream of bad news.”the audience cheered as the president was introduced and went on to speak about his policies, including healthcare and education.he urged the audience to interact with people with different political beliefs: “seek out people who don’t agree with you and it will also help you to compromise.”obama also said: “you should feel encouraged social attitudes are changing. that doesn’t mean it’s fast enough but you should keep pushing and it’s in part due to the courageous acts of young people like yourself.”when asked about his presidential legacy, obama said he was proud of the healthcare reforms, which received huge cheers from the audience, and said of the us response to the 2008 financial crisis: “saving the world from great depression – that was quite good.”he also listed diplomatic deals with iran and the response to the ebola crisis as highlights of his presidency. “i’m proud; i think i’ve been true to myself during this process.”but he added: “don’t give up and succumb to cynics if, after five years, poverty hasn’t been eradicated … it’s ok. dr martin luther king says the arc of the moral universe is long but bends towards justice.”questioned on the controversial transatlantic trade and investment partnership (ttip), he said: “the answer to globalization is not to pull up the drawbridge and shut off,” though it was crucial to pay attention to workers’ rights.before obama arrived, tanya williams, a community engagement officer, told the guardian: “i love michelle but i like obama and it’s exciting to have the chance to hear someone who has changed so much and galvanized so many people who didn’t vote before.”oliver sidorczuk, 26, said: “everyone is extremely excited to listen to what he has to say. i’m going to ask him about electoral rights and try to ask him if he would join our campaign to ask david cameron for automatic registration.”obama ended the session by taking a question from a young sikh londoner, who asked about the issue of racial profiling at airports and being mistaken for a muslim.obama said that, although there were people with “crazy ideology”, pluralism was important. “i visited a mosque a few months ago and said our greatest allies are american muslims who are most integrated and economically well off,” he said.furqan naeem, a campaigner from manchester, said: “i recently visited the states through the us embassy on the community leaders programme and saw first hand some really important work the president did in celebrating america’s diversity and bringing communities together.”kenny imafidon, the managing director of the youth organization clearview research, said afterwards: “it was a great opportunity and what will stick with me is what he said about meeting with people who have different politics from you and having to make compromises. also, the thing he said about being a good leader and finding great talent.”later, obama met jeremy corbyn, who said they had an “excellent” 90-minute discussion.the labour leader said they talked about “the challenges facing postindustrial societies and the power of global corporations, and the increasing use of technology around the world and the effect that has”.asked if they talked about the president’s intervention in the debate on britain’s membership of the eu, corbyn said it was discussed briefly.after the meeting, obama joined cameron to play golf at the grove in chandlers cross, hertfordshire. obama ended the day at a dinner with the prime minister and the us ambassador, matthew barzun, at the ambassador’s residence, before travelling on to germany.
advanced	as soon as the children at one primary school in stirling hear the words òdaily mileó, they down their pencils and head out of the classroom to start running laps around the school  eld. for three-and-a-half years, all pupils at st ninianõs primary have walked or run a mile each day. they do so at random times during the day, apparently happily, and, despite the rise in childhood obesity across the uk, none of the children at the school are overweight.the daily mile has done so much to improve these childrenõs  tness, behaviour and concentration in lessons that scores of nursery and primary schools across britain are following suit and getting pupils to get up from their desks and take 15 minutes to walk or run round the school or local park.elaine wyllie, headteacher of st ninianõs, said: òi get at least two emails a day from other schools and local authorities asking how we do it. the thought of children across the country running every day because of something weõve done is phenomenal.óone in ten children are obese when they start school at the age of four or  ve, according to  gures from the health & social care information centre, and, in the summer of 2015, a study found that schoolchildren in england are the least  t they have ever been. primary schools have therefore been quick to note the bene ts of the daily mile. it has been introduced in schools in london, gateshead, wales and other parts of scotland, while others are planning to launch the initiative during the 2015-6 academic year. in stirling alone, 30 schools have already started or are to start the daily mile.òitõs a common-sense approach to childrenõs  tness, which is free and easy. the most important thing is that the children really enjoy it; otherwise, you couldnõt sustain it. they come back in bright-eyed and rosy-cheeked, how children used to look. itõs joyous to see,ó said wyllie. at st ninianõs, teachers take their pupils out of lessons on to a specially built circuit around the schoolõs playing  eld for their daily mile whenever it best suits that dayõs timetable. only ice or very heavy rain stop them.the extent of the bene ts have yet to be determined but researchers from stirling university have launched a comparative study to look for quantitative evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile. dr colin moran, who is leading the study, said: òthe children at st ninianõs donõt seem to have problems with obesity; they seem happier and staff say they settle into lessons faster so we designed a study that would test all of these things. there is a lot of anecdotal evidence about the bene ts but there arenõt any scienti c facts yet.ó st ninianõs pupils will be compared with children from another school in stirling that has yet to start the scheme.kevin clelland, a primary school teacher from leeds, visited st ninianõs before convincing his colleagues it was a great idea. he said: òitõs such a simple thing to do but seems to have such an amazing impact. weõre really committed to improving the  tness of our pupils beyond the two-hour statutory pe that we are expected to deliver.ó his school is now constructing a track.active cheshire, a strategic body for sports and  tness in cheshire and warrington, is taking a group of senior  gures from the local authority up to scotland to assess the results of the daily mile. the hope is to introduce it across the 450 schools in the region if a pilot is successful.paralympian, tanni grey-thompson, chair of ukactive, the ukõs leading not-for-pro t health body for physical activity, said: òall children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day, whether in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground. itõs fantastic to see initiatives like the daily mile be established, showing real leadership from the education sector to improve childrenõs  tness levels and their cognitive behaviour, and make a real difference to schools, teachers, parents and young peopleõs lives. we know sitting still kills; not sitting still helps children build skills that will stay with them for life.óthe scottish government is also supportive. a spokesperson said: òlearning in pe is enhanced by initiatives like the daily mile, which can encourage and support parents in fostering healthy habits with their children from a young age. we are pleased to see so many scottish schools are taking part or planning to do so.ó
advanced	the regulation eight hours in the office is over. the most important work of the day is done; whatever is left can wait until the morning. this is the point many workers would think about heading for the door.yet, for millions of japanese employees, the thought of clearing away their desks and being at home in time for dinner is enough to invite accusations of disloyalty.but, after decades of giving companies carte blanche to milk every last drop of productivity from their workforce, a challenge to japan’s ingrained culture of overwork has come from the government, which is considering making it a legal requirement for workers to take at least five days’ paid holiday a year.japanese employees are currently entitled to an average 18.5 days’ paid holiday a year – only two fewer than the global average – with a minimum of ten days, as well as 15 one-day national holidays. in reality, few come even close to taking their full quota, typically using only nine of their 18.5-day average entitlement, according to the labour ministry. while many british workers regard a two-week summer holiday as an inalienable right, workers in japan have come to see a four-night vacation in hawaii as the height of self-indulgence.the move, to be debated in the current parliamentary session, comes after companies started encouraging employees to nap on the job to improve their performance.by the end of the decade, the government hopes that, if passed, the law will push japanese employees towards following the example set by british workers, who use an average of 20 days’ paid annual leave, and those in france, who take an average of 25.japan’s unforgiving work culture may have helped turn it into an economic superpower, its corporate foot soldiers revered in the rest of the world for their commitment to the company, but this has often been to the exclusion of everything else.japan’s low birth rate and predictions of rapid population decline are partly blamed on the lack of time couples have to start families. more employees are falling ill from stress, or worse, succumbing to karoshi, death through overwork.despite studies suggesting that longer hours in the office or workshop or on the factory floor do not necessarily make people more productive, today’s workers are still nursing a collective hangover from the bubble years of the 1980s.about 22% of japanese work more than 49 hours a week, compared with 16% of us workers and 11% in france and germany, according to data compiled by the japanese government. at 35%, south korea’s workaholics are even worse off.in spending 14 hours a day at work and giving up many of her paid holidays, erika sekiguchi is not even an extreme example. the 36-year-old trading company employee used eight of her 20 days of paid vacation in 2014, six of which counted as sick leave. “nobody else uses their vacation days,” sekiguchi said.she faces the dilemma shared by her peers in companies across japan: never to take time off to recharge or to risk inviting criticism for appearing to leave more committed colleagues in the lurch.yuu wakebe, a health ministry official overseeing policy on working hours, who admits putting in 100 hours of overtime a month, blames the irresistible pressure to match one’s colleagues, hour for hour. “it is a worker’s right to take paid vacations,” wakebe said. “but working in japan involves quite a lot of volunteer spirit.”that fear of being ostracized at work is being blamed for a rise in stress-related illness, premature death and suicide. according to official data, about 200 people die every year from heart attacks, strokes and other karoshi events brought on by punishing work schedules.the prime minister, shinzo abe, is not known for taking long vacations. yet even he has spoken out against the unreasonable demands companies place on their employees as they struggle to stay afloat in a more complex globalized market. japan’s working culture, abe said recently, “falsely beatifies long hours”.
advanced	swedish prisons have long had a reputation around the world for being progressive. but are the country’s prisons a soft option?the head of sweden’s prison and probation service, nils oberg, announced in november 2013 that four swedish prisons are to be closed due to an “out of the ordinary” decline in prisoner numbers.although there has been no fall in crime rates, between 2011 and 2012 there was a 6% drop in sweden’s prisoner population, now a little over 4,500. a similar decrease is expected in 2013 and 2014. oberg admitted to being puzzled by the unexpected dip, but expressed optimism that the reason was to do with how his prisons are run. “we certainly hope that the efforts we invest in rehabilitation and preventing relapse of crime has had an impact,” he said.“the modern prison service in sweden is very different from when i joined as a young prison officer in 1978,” says kenneth gustafsson, governor of kumla prison, sweden’s most secure jail, situated 130 miles west of stockholm. however, he doesn’t think the system has gone soft. “when i joined, the focus was very much on humanity in prisons. prisoners were treated well – maybe too well, some might say. but, after a number of high-profile escapes in 2004, we had to rebalance and place more emphasis on security.”despite the hardening of attitudes toward prison security following the escape scandals, the swedes still managed to maintain a broadly humane approach to sentencing, even of the most serious offenders: jail terms rarely exceed ten years; those who receive life imprisonment can still apply to the courts after a decade to have the sentence commuted to a fixed term, usually in the region of 18 to 25 years. sweden was the first country in europe to introduce the electronic tagging of convicted criminals and continues to strive to minimize short-term prison sentences wherever possible by using community-based measures, which have been proven to be more effective at reducing reoffending.the overall reoffending rate in sweden stands at between 30 and 40% over three years – to compare that with another european country, the number is around half that of the uk. one likely reason for the relatively low reoffending rate and the low rate of incarceration in sweden (below 70 per 100,000 head of population) is that the age of criminal responsibility is set at 15. in the uk, for example, children aged ten to 17 and young people under the age of 21 record the highest reoffending rates: almost three quarters and two thirds, respectively. a good proportion of these offenders go on to populate adult jails. in sweden, no young person under the age of 21 can be sentenced to life – this is not the case in many other countries – and every effort is made to ensure that as few juvenile offenders as possible end up in prison.one strong reason for the drop in prison numbers might be the amount of post-prison support available in sweden. a confident probation service – a government agency – is tasked not only with supervising those on probation but is also guaranteed to provide treatment programmes for offenders with drug, alcohol or violence issues. the service is assisted by around 4,500 lay supervisors – members of the public who volunteer to befriend and support offenders under supervision.gustafsson talks about broader goals and objectives for the swedish justice department: “in 2013 and 2014, the priority of our work will be with young offenders and men with convictions of violent behaviour. for many years, we have been running programmes to help those addicted to drugs. now, we are also developing programmes to address behaviours such as aggression and violence. these are the important things for our society when these people are released.”i spoke to a former prisoner who now runs a social enterprise called x-cons sweden. peter soderlund served almost three years of a four-year sentence for drug and weapons offences before he was released in 1998. he was helped by a newly formed organization run by former prisoners called kris (criminals’ return into society).“the big difference between kris and us is that we are happy to allow people who are still taking addiction medications to join us,” he says. both organizations work with the same goal: helping prisoners successfully reintegrate into society after they have been released. and what is life like for the prisoner in sweden? “when i was inside, i was lucky. in osteraker prison, where i served my sentence, the governor was enlightened. we were treated well. but i knew that not all swedish prisons were like that. i met so many people in there who needed help – after i received help from kris, i knew i wanted to help others. with x-cons, we meet them at the gate and support them into accommodation and offer a network of support.”“in sweden, we believe very much in the concept of rehabilitation, without being naive of course,” says gustafsson. “there are some people who will not or cannot change. but, in my experience, the majority of prisoners want to change, and we must do what we can to help to facilitate that. it is not always possible to achieve this in one prison sentence.“also, it is not just prison that can rehabilitate – it is often a combined process, involving probation and greater society. we can give education and training, but, when they leave prison, these people need housing and jobs.”
advanced	on one day in august, one in seven people on earth, 1 billion people, used facebook, according to founder mark zuckerberg. in a decade, the social network has transformed peopleõs relationships, privacy, their businesses, news media, helped topple regimes and even changed the meanings of everyday words.òa more open and connected world is a better world. it brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society that re ects all of our values,ó wrote zuckerberg in the post announcing the numbers.these are just some of the ways his company changed everything ð for better or worse.1 facebook has changed the de nition of òfriendó òto friendó is now a verb. and, unlike in real life, when the ending of a friendship can be deeply traumatic, it is easy to òunfriendó, a word invented to describe ditching a casual acquaintance when they are no longer enhancing your facebook newsfeed.although the meanings of the words òshareó and òlikeó are essentially the same, facebook has brought an entirely new weight to the terms.school and university reunions have become redundant ð you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and youõve seen endless pictures of your schoolmatesõ babies. you wonõt be surprised by an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyõre dating someone else from the romantic sel es.but, unlike in real life, facebook has no hierarchy of friendships. a classmate from one project at university who you havenõt seen in 15 years, a friend-of-a-friend from a stag do or a colleague youõve never actually spoken to in person ð they are all facebook friends in the same way as your closest mate or your spouse or your mum.it doesnõt necessarily mean we see them the same way. professor robin dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have roughly 150 people as a social group. facebook hasnõt changed that yet, he believes, but, in an interview with the new yorker, dunbar said he feared it was so easy simply to end friendships on facebook that, eventually, there may no longer be any need to learn to get along.2 we care less about privacy thereõs a wise saying: if youõre not paying for it, youõre the product. facebook embodies that philosophy and created an entire industry from it. the astonishing thing is that users know that and they willingly hand over that information.pew research center found that most young people are more than willing to hand over their details. an overwhelming majority of 91% post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, up from 61%, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.but, as so much of a personõs life is shared online, facebook gives a platform for everyone to cultivate an image and a fanbase. in an article for the journal frontiers in psychology, academics described a new phenomenon, the emergence of the òfacebook selfó.more than 80% list their interests, allowing brands to target them most effectively. but most younger users do restrict their pro les, with 60% allowing friends only.3 facebook has created millions of jobs ð but not in its own of ces facebook has essentially created an entire sector, including indirect employment for people whose job it is to make the platform work for their brand.òit is a tool like no other,ó said michael tinmouth, a social media strategist who has worked with brands such as vodafone and microsoft. òmarketers have an understanding of a brandõs consumers like they have never had before. the data and analytics available to you are extraordinary. you know who your customers are, who they are friends with and how they engage with your brand.óand advertisers pay a lot for that. facebook reported ad revenue was up 46%, reaching $3.32bn.facebook is also a mine eld for brands. suddenly, rather than complaint conversations taking place over the phone with a customer service representative or on a small specialist internet forum, angry customers can post their complaints for hundreds of their friends to see or even on the page where all loyal fans of the brand have been carefully cultivated. and an injustice can go viral.4 facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions though the arab spring was dubbed the twitter revolution, organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by facebook. manchester universityõs olga onuch found facebook had been the key medium for reaching half of all the euromaidan protesters in ukraine.facebook posts signalled the start of the maidan protests during the hours after it was announced that ukraine would not sign a free trade and association agreement with the eu, onuch found. the posts organized live action, not just online anger. mustafa nayyem, the ukraine activist, posted: òif you really want to do something, donõt just ôlikeõ this post. letõs meet near the monument to independence in the middle of the maidan.ómany of those interviewed in onuchõs research said they relied on facebook for the truth about what was happening ð unable to trust traditional media.5 facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news roughly 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63% of users overall, according to the pew research center. about a third of facebook users post about politics and government.most people will  rst encounter a piece of journalism or an item of breaking news via facebook or other social media, and most of those encounters will be on mobiles.users might never have to leave the site to get their news: instant articles will see stories run within facebook. it allows news companies to sell ads around their articles, gaining them 100% of that revenue, while facebook can also sell ads around that article, with 70% of the revenue from the social networkõs advertising also going to the news companies.facebook has also changed the ways journalists write stories. it is a resource many reporters cannot now live without. for better or (often) worse, it is a directory to  nd, contact and glean information for almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly  nd themselves at the centre of the dayõs biggest news story. facebook has its own newswire, sharing the most useful user reaction to breaking stories, including pictures and videos.6 users are changing facebook it used to be a site to get students connected, with only elite us universities allowed access.in 2014, a decade after its launch, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a facebook account. and 39% are connected to people they have never met in person.groups have given way to pages, writing on each others walls is passe and carefully curated albums have given way to instant mobile uploads. more than ever, the site is a gateway not just to your friends but to the rest of the internet.we may as well get used to it, said david kirkpatrick, author of the facebook effect. òit might very well go away further down the road but something this big takes a long time to disappear,ó he told bbc radio 4õs today programme. òfacebook has proven its ability to change and it will continue to be a very, very major player.ó
advanced	a lonely old man living in a crater on the moon is the unlikely focus of john lewis’s christmas 2015 advert, as the department store puts a charitable spin on its latest multi-million pound campaign.amid increasing hype around john lewis’s seasonal ad, which has come to mark the beginning of the christmas shopping season for many, the department store will aim to use its profile to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for age uk. it will also encourage staff and customers to join up with their local branch of the charity to care for elderly people who might otherwise be alone over the holiday.the retailer has spent £7m on a campaign that ranges from the slick tv ad to a smartphone game and merchandise, including glow-in-thedark pyjamas, as well as areas decked out like the surface of the moon in 11 stores.after two years of successful ads featuring cuddly animals – a bear and hare, then a penguin – this time, the retailer is tugging at the heartstrings with a story of a young girl, lily, who spots an old man living in a shack on the moon through her telescope. the determined child tries sending him a letter and firing a note via bow and arrow, before floating him a present of a telescope tied to balloons, which finally enables them to make contact.the ad’s strapline is: “show someone they’re loved this christmas”, which echoes age uk’s own campaign: “no one should have no one at christmas”. profits from three products – a mug, gift tag and card – will go to the charity.“the charity really resonates with people at this time of year and the ad lends itself to thinking about someone who lives on your street that might not see anybody,” said rachel swift, head of marketing at john lewis.the campaign features the oasis track half the world away reinterpreted by little-known norwegian artist aurora.the ad cost £1m to make. the moon scenes were shot at the warner bros studios, where the harry potter films were made, and the specially built set was created by one of the team behind the latest star wars film, the force awakens.as in the last few years, john lewis has drummed up interest in their most recent ad with a teaser campaign on tv and social media using the hashtag #onthemoon. there will be a full moon on christmas day 2015 – a complete coincidence, according to swift.in 2014, the retailer also spent £7m on a campaign featuring a realistic animated penguin and a young boy playing together to the tune of john lennon’s real love, sung by british singer-songwriter tom odell. it had drummed up 22m views on youtube by the first week of january, ahead of the 16.6m clocked by sainsbury’s ad featuring first world war soldiers sharing a bar of chocolate, the uk’s next most popular ad of 2014.swift said that, despite the hype, john lewis had stuck to the same strategy for the last five years. “it’s all about thoughtful gifting and going the extra mile for someone you love at christmas,” she said. “we don’t go into it thinking, ‘this is going to be huge,’ just getting something right for the brand at this time of year and something we hope customers really love.”sarah vizard, news editor of trade journal marketing week, said john lewis appeared to have reined in its efforts this time, with a lowerkey presence in stores despite a growing army of competitors. “there are definitely a lot more brands doing christmas ads this year but i think a lot of those brands who tried to compete with john lewis by doing something emotional and creative have gone back to what you can buy in store,” she said. “john lewis still does the emotional piece the best. this campaign is another great way of putting that across in a way that will resonate with customers. i think people will think it is really cute.”among those fighting for attention in the flurry of christmas ads was sister chain, waitrose, which launched its christmas ad online on social media ahead of a tv debut during the x factor. it used the agency which has created john lewis’s christmas ads for years.burberry has launched what is only its second festive film, featuring romeo beckham and elton john, while electrical chain currys drafted in jeff goldblum for its first ever dedicated christmas ad. asda, lidl and morrisons also launched their campaigns at the beginning of november.marc bolland, chief executive of marks & spencer, which also launched its christmas ad at the beginning of november, said that, in the first week of september, the most searched term on its website was christmas.boots, another retailer launching its festive campaign in early november, is going back to a more traditional approach after a critically acclaimed ad in 2014, which featured a family going to great lengths to get together at christmas.
advanced	wales will become the first country in the uk where people will be presumed to have consented for their organs to be donated unless they opt out.the welsh assembly has voted to adopt the opt-out policy, which will allow hospitals to act on the assumption that people who die want to donate unless they have specifically registered an objection.the final stage of a bill to adopt a system of presumed consent was passed by 43 votes to eight, with two abstentions, in spite of objections from religious groups on moral grounds and concerns that the scheme could add to the distress of grieving families.“this is a huge day for wales, for devolution and, most importantly, for the 226 people in wales waiting for an organ transplant,” said the welsh health minister, mark drakeford.“i am proud that wales will be the first nation in the uk to take this step. as a society, we have shown we are prepared to take action to increase organ donation and to provide hope to those people waiting every week for a transplant.“family refusal is a major factor that affects the numbers of organ donations and the main reason for refusal is lack of knowledge of their loved one’s wishes.“the family of the potential donor has a major role to play in organ donation. the aim of the bill has always been to respect the wishes of the deceased; however, relatives or friends may object to consent being deemed based on what they know about the views of the deceased.“when family members know that organ donation is what the deceased would have wanted, they usually agree to participate in the donation process. the new law will work by clarifying people’s wishes around the issue of organ donation and, in turn, increase the rate of consent to donation.“today is a landmark day for wales and i expect the rest of the uk to be watching with great interest when the legislation is implemented in 2015.”the issue is controversial, with opponents worried that the pressing need for more kidneys and hearts will lead to the wishes of those who have died and their family being overruled. but ministers insist there will be safeguards.inevitably, some people will not get around to registering their opposition. in response to concerns, the government recently announced that families would play a bigger role.relatives are to have a “clear right of objection”, giving them the chance to show that the deceased would not have wanted to be an organ donor.wales has acted because of an acute shortage of organs. “we have the enduring problem of not having enough organs for people who need them,” said drakeford. “about one person every week dies in wales while on a waiting list. we have been working to improve the rate of organ donation and have had some success, but we’re looking to take the next step forward.“around a third of the welsh population is on the organ donor register, but well over twothirds in surveys say they are happy to be organ donors. that other third is people who don’t get round to putting their names down. we’re hoping to make inroads into that.”the new law would apply to anybody over 18 who has lived in wales for at least the year before his or her death. donated organs would not only go to people in need of a transplant in wales but to anybody in the uk.doctors are delighted at the move. the british medical association has long campaigned for an opt-out system because of its concern over the growing number of people needing transplants – a result of medical progress in transplantation.the number of young donors dropped substantially when seatbelt legislation came in. big efforts have been made in recent years to increase the number of those who carry an organ donation card, with a good deal of success. hospitals have also brought in improved systems for coordinating transplants, including the crucial discussions with relatives when there is no indication of the wishes of the deceased. but the increase in numbers of organs harvested is still not enough.some religious groups, on the other hand, strongly oppose the scheme, arguing that it would cause further distress to bereaved relatives. members of the muslim council of wales and the south wales jewish representative council have expressed reservations, while the archbishop of wales, barry morgan, said that “donation ought to be a gift of love, of generosity. if organs can be taken unless someone has explicitly registered an objection, that’s not an expression of love. it’s more a medical use of a body.”
advanced	there are eyes on you, behind the bright lights and mirrored panels. pick up a boot and a camera will make sure you donõt slip it into your bag. enter a department store and you will be watched. but new technology is leading retailers to grow a different set of eyes ð less focused on shoplifting and more interested in your age, sex, size, head, shoulders, knees and toes.a few months ago, it  rm computer sciences corporation (csc) produced a report that claimed around 30% of retailers use facial recognition technology to track customers in-store. facial recognition is a technology that can identify people by analysing and comparing facial features from a database, using devices such as intel realsense cameras, which are able to analyse everything from particular expressions to the clothing brands someone is wearing.joe jensen, of intelõs retail solutions division, says that the aim of bringing realsense technology into shops is not to create databases of speci c peopleõs lives but rather to build generalized models of peopleõs lifestyles and shopping habits. òitõs not so much that you need to know a particular customer. itõs that you need to know that this shopper has these characteristics and, in the past, that when those characteristics are present, this is what a person tends to do.óif you combine recognition technology with databases of previous customer patterns, you can start to predict a lot about what a person may or may not do in a shop. if, say, thereõs a size-10 woman wearing a gold necklace walking quickly towards the sock aisle, you can use that data to predict she wants to, well, buy socks. that could allow a retailer to automatically put targeted ads on screens aimed speci cally at that person. if she looks like the type of person who wants to buy socks, they will show her adverts for socks.if it sounds familiar, itõs because the online world has been using techniques like these for years. if you search for something on amazon, youõll be hounded by targeted banners for similar products on other sites. express a vague interest in canoeing and youõll get ads for canoes wherever you go. yet bringing these systems into the physical world isnõt a simple case of copy and paste. it turns out that people do not react to cameras in the same way as they do to browser cookies.hoxton analytics, a london-based team of data scientists, has developed a technology that makes use of machine learning and arti cial intelligence to categorize people based on the shoes they are wearing. by analysing the style and size of peopleõs footwear as they walk past the sensor, the system can identify a customerõs gender with between 75 and 80% accuracy.owen mccormack, hoxton analytics ceo, says that the focus of the system came about in part as a reaction to facial recognition. òmy idea was, why donõt we simply consider the clothes someoneõs wearing to understand demographics?ó he said. òif i just showed you a shot of someoneõs body you could probably tell me what gender they are. however, it turns out pointing a camera at someoneõs chest or hips feels just as creepy as facial recognition. the idea was ð what about peopleõs shoes?óthe word òcreepyó comes up a lot during discussions of in-store tracking. for retailers and data scientists, the aim is to  nd a way of obtaining information without coming across as intrusive.for hoxton analytics and the retailers using the technology, the answer is to look downwards. this tactic of avoiding the face and staring at shoes says a lot about how we, as physical beings, react to being watched. it suggests there are boundaries that do not exist on the internet. set sights on our torsos and we feel invaded. but is making calculated judgments about a person based on their footwear actually any less invasive?for mccormack, the argument hinges on the fact that personally identi able information isnõt being collected. òright now, shops are doing lots of incredibly invasive things but we just donõt know about it. the angle hoxton analytics is taking on that whole thing is, well, if you know someoneõs a male or a female, then your advertising will be much more ef cient. if you know that everyone in your shop right now is a male, youõll be advertising playstations not hairdryers.ókeep it hidden and invisible monitoring lets shops optimize their output while keeping the customer unaware. put adaptable monitors and targeted advertising into the mix, however, and it becomes harder to hide the fact that a machine is watching you. the argument from the retailers is that they do this to provide a personal shopping experience but it remains a grey area. it still feels creepy.from the perspective of retailers, itõs understandable that physical shops want some of the information online outlets collect. we allow this to happen online so why not of ine? the thresholds of a shopping centre are different from those between websites and, when you can wander freely from one place to another without a pop-up asking you to accept cookies, the rules of consent change.then again, for a generation growing up with online  rst, physical shop second, the modes of online play may not be quite so invasive. in the csc report, a survey indicated that while 72% of respondents aged 55 and over said they were very uncomfortable with these types of technologies being used in physical shops, only 51% of 16-24 year olds said the same.does this relative openness stem from a greater familiarity with digital technology or a blind belief in the goodwill of omnipresent organizations offering free services? is the creepiness of a technology an unvarying, instinctive certainty or does it ebb and  ow with degrees of social acceptance? whatever the case, there are a growing number of eyes between the shelves and they care a lot about what youõre wearing.
advanced	when the taliban sent a gunman to shoot malala yousafzai in october 2012 as she rode home on a bus after school, they made clear their intention: to silence the teenager and kill off her campaign for girls’ education.nine months and countless surgical operations later, she stood up at the united nations on her 16th birthday on friday to deliver a defiant riposte. “they thought that the bullet would silence us. but they failed,” she said.as 16th birthdays go, it was among the more unusual. instead of blowing out candles on a cake, malala sat in one of the main council chambers at the united nations in the central seat usually reserved for world leaders.she listened quietly as ban ki-moon, the un secretary-general, described her as “our hero, our champion”; and as the former british prime minister and now un education envoy, gordon brown, uttered what he called “the words the taliban never wanted her to hear: happy 16th birthday, malala”.the event, dubbed malala day, was the culmination of an extraordinary four years for the girl from mingora, in the troubled swat valley of pakistan. she was thrust into the public glare after she wrote a blog for the bbc urdu service describing her experiences struggling to get an education under the rising power of taliban militants.by 11, she was showing exceptional determination, calling personally on the us special representative to pakistan, richard holbrooke, to use his influence to combat the taliban’s drive against education for girls. by 14, she was on the radar of archbishop desmond tutu, who put her forward for the international children’s peace prize, and, by 15, she became the youngest nobel peace prize nominee in history.but such dizzying global attention came at a price. death threats followed her growing recognition, and, on 9 october 2012, following a meeting of pakistani taliban leaders, the gunman was dispatched to remove what they called the “symbol of infidels and obscenity”.multiple operations in pakistan and the uk followed the attack on the bus, including the fitting of a titanium plate on her left forehead and a cochlear implant to restore her hearing. she now lives with her family in birmingham and does what the taliban tried to stop her doing: goes to school every day. “i am not against anyone,” she said in the un chamber, having taken this day out from the classroom. “neither am i here to speak in terms of personal revenge against the taliban or any other terrorist group.”malala responded to the violence of the taliban with her own countervailing force: words against bullets. “i do not even hate the talib who shot me. even if there is a gun in my hand and he stands in front of me, i would not shoot him.”she spoke confidently, with only an injured eye and a slightly drooping left side of her face to hint at such fresh traumas. there was one other unstated allusion to the horror of her past: she wore a white shawl belonging to a woman who was also targeted by extremists but who, unlike malala, did not survive to tell the tale: benazir bhutto, the former prime minister of pakistan.“the extremists are afraid of books and pens,” the teenager continued. “the power of education frightens them. they are afraid of women. the power of the voice of women frightens them.”she cited the attack in june on a hospital in quetta, capital of baluchistan, and killings of female teachers in khyber pakhtunkhwa. “that is why they are blasting schools every day – because they were and they are afraid of change, afraid of the equality that we will bring to our society.”and she gave her own opposing interpretation of islam to the taliban’s. “they think that god is a tiny, little conservative being who would send girls to hell just because of going to school. the terrorists are misusing the name of islam and pashtun society for their own personal benefits. islam is a religion of peace, humanity and brotherhood. islam says that it is not only each child’s right to get education, rather it is their duty and responsibility.”such ability to articulate what normally remains unarticulated – to give voice to young people normally silenced – has generated its own response. the “stand with malala” petition, calling for education for the 57 million children around the world who do not go to school, has attracted more than four million signatures – more than a million having been added shortly after malala’s speech.at the start of her speech, malala said: “i don’t know where to begin my speech. i don’t know what people would be expecting me to say.” she need not have worried.
