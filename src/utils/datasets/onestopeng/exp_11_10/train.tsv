intermediate	loneliness has finally become a hot topic. the office for national statistics has found britain to be the loneliest place in europe. british people are less likely to have strong friendships or know their neighbours than people anywhere else in the european union. and research at the university of chicago has found that loneliness is twice as bad for older people’s health as obesity and almost as great a cause of death as poverty.this is shocking but such studies do not examine the loneliness epidemic among younger adults. in 2010, the mental health foundation found that loneliness was a greater concern among young people than among the elderly. the 18- to 34-year-olds surveyed were more likely to feel lonely often, to worry about feeling alone and to feel depressed because of loneliness than the over-55s.“loneliness is a recognized problem among the elderly and there are day centres and charities to help them,” says sam challis, of the mental health charity mind, “but, when young people reach 21, they’re too old for youth services.” this is problematic because of the close relationship between loneliness and mental health – it is linked to increased stress, depression, paranoia, anxiety, addiction and it is a known cause of suicide.but what can young people do to prevent loneliness? one researcher at the oxford internet institute points out that social media and the internet can be both a good thing and a problem. they are beneficial when they enable us to communicate with distant loved ones but not when they replace face-to-face contact. “people present an idealized version of themselves online and we expect to have social lives like those we see in the media,” says challis. comparing the perfect lives of our friends with our own lives can lead us to withdraw socially.meditation techniques and apps such as headspace are trendy solutions frequently recommended for a range of mental health problems, but they’re not necessarily helpful for loneliness, as they actively encourage us to be alone with our thoughts. “it is better to address the causes of your loneliness first – what’s stopping you going out and seeing people?” says challis.indeed, a study of social media at the university of michigan in 2013 found that using technology to help you meet new people can be beneficial. and, if you are unable to go out for some reason, the internet can help you. for example, mumsnet, an online network for parents, can help you feel less alone when bringing up young children.helplines can also reduce loneliness, at least in the short term. one in four men who call the emotional support charity samaritans mention loneliness or isolation and get connected is a free confidential helpline for young people, where they can get help with emotional and mental health problems often linked to loneliness. there are also support services on websites such as mind’s that can remind you you’re not alone.at work, it can be beneficial to tell your employer how you’re feeling. john binns advises businesses on mental health and well-being. he was admitted to hospital for stress-related depression in 2007 and took two months off work. he felt as if there was no one to talk to and wasn’t close enough to colleagues for them to notice the changes in his behaviour. more openness with his employer and colleagues made his return to work easier. office chit-chat may seem like a waste of time but it helps to protect us from the emotional and psychological effects of work strain.“we treat the networks we have as incidental but they’re fundamental to our well-being,” says nicky forsythe, a psychotherapist and the founder of talk for health, an organization that trains people to give and receive support in groups. “the most important thing is to have a regular time and place to reflect on your life and to have an empathetic listener.”if we believe recent research, loneliness is killing the elderly and, with an ageing population, we should aim to reduce our isolation before it is too late. “getting older doesn’t have to mean getting lonelier,” says ruth sutherland, the chief executive of the relationship counselling service relate. “but it is very important to lay the foundations to good-quality relationships earlier in life.”nannan
intermediate	every morning, before the temperatures in india’s capital start to rise, a handful of old friends gather. on the dry grass not far from the india gate monument at the centre of delhi, they stretch, breathe and meditate.“it is the only healthy way to start the day. much better than an egg or a sandwich or a cup of tea,” said arvind singh at 6.15am as he did his breathing exercises on a bench.singh, a 42-year-old salesman, and his friends are not alone. all across india, in the overcrowded cities, on whatever green space is left, you can see similar scenes.on 21 june – the new international day of yoga – narendra modi, india’s prime minister, hopes the world will join in. on the grass near india gate, up to 45,000 people will take part in a 35-minute class – they hope it will be the biggest yoga session ever.the participants will include 64-year-old modi, most of his government and, they hope, a range of celebrities.encouraging indians, and others, to stretch has become a focus for modi, who led his bharatiya janata party to a landslide election victory in 2014. in may 2015, schools were told to make sure students attended yoga events at the same time as the big demonstration in delhi, even though it is on a sunday.india’s police officers are well known for being out of shape. so, the government has said they want to introduce compulsory yoga for them. they have said, too, that daily yoga lessons will be offered free to three million civil servants and their families. air india, the national airline, has also said it will introduce yoga for trainee pilots.modi, an ascetic who is a vegetarian and an enthusiastic yoga practitioner, suggested an international yoga day when he was speaking to the united nations on a visit to new york in 2014.modi said that yoga is an invaluable gift of india’s ancient tradition. he said that it encourages unity of mind and body, thought and action, harmony between man and nature, and a holistic approach to health and wellbeing. he added, “it is not about exercise but discovering the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and nature.”yoga is between 3,000 and 6,000 years old. it came from somewhere on the indian subcontinent, possibly from among religious ascetics. its meditative practices, as well as its physical exercises, have long been associated with local religious traditions including buddhism and jainism, as well as hinduism, which is practised by 80% of indians.modi has been criticized before for creating a view of indian culture that has little place for other traditions. one person called the event on 21 june “a mix of cultural nationalism and commercialization”.others, however, talk about a recent us court ruling that said yoga was not always linked to religion. a court in california ruled that: “the practice of yoga may be religious in some contexts but yoga classes as taught in the [san diego] district are not religious, mystical or spiritual.” this ruling came after two christian parents said they believed that yoga in schools was a hindu exercise.amish tripathi, the author of best-selling novels set 4,000 years ago in india that retell stories from hindu mythology, said characters in his books practise yoga.“in ancient india, yoga was part of daily life, both the physical and the mental aspects. every culture has gifted something to the world and this is our gift,” tripathi said.suneel singh, a guru in south delhi, agreed that yoga did not belong to any one religion: “is t’ai chi just chinese? is football just english? it is the same with yoga – yoga is for everybody. it is a cheap way to stay healthy.”nan
intermediate	a lonely old man living on the moon is the unusual focus of john lewis’s 2015 christmas advert.there is increasing hype around john lewis’s seasonal ad, which has come to mark the beginning of the christmas shopping season for many. the department store will aim to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for age uk. it will also encourage staff and customers to join up with their local branch of the charity to care for elderly people who might be alone over the holiday.the department store has spent £7m on a campaign that ranges from the tv ad to a smartphone game and merchandise, including glow-in-the-dark pyjamas, as well as making areas that look like the surface of the moon in 11 of their stores.after two years of successful ads with cuddly animals – a bear and hare, then a penguin – this time, the store is tugging at the heartstrings with a story of a young girl, lily, who spots an old man living in a shack on the moon through her telescope. the determined child tries sending him a letter and firing a note via bow and arrow, before floating him a present of a telescope tied to balloons, which finally allows them to make contact.the ad’s message is: “show someone they’re loved this christmas”, which echoes age uk’s own campaign: “no one should have no one at christmas”. profits from three products – a mug, gift tag and card – will go to the charity.rachel swift, head of marketing at john lewis, said that people talk about the charity at this time of year and the ad makes you think about someone who lives on your street that might not see anybody.the campaign features the oasis track half the world away reinterpreted by norwegian artist aurora.the ad cost £1m to make. the moon scenes were shot at the warner bros studios, where the harry potter films were made, and the specially built set was created by one of the team behind the latest star wars film, the force awakens.as in the last few years, john lewis has drummed up interest in their most recent ad with a teaser campaign on tv and social media using the hashtag #onthemoon. a full moon will fall on christmas day 2015 – a complete coincidence, according to swift.in 2014, the retailer also spent £7m on a campaign with a realistic animated penguin and a young boy playing together to the tune of john lennon’s real love, sung by british singer-songwriter tom odell. it had drummed up 22m views on youtube by the first week of january – more than the 16.6m views of sainsbury’s ad with first world war soldiers sharing a bar of chocolate, the uk’s second most popular ad of 2014.swift said that, despite the hype, john lewis had kept the same strategy for the last five years. “it’s all about thoughtful gifting and going the extra mile for someone you love at christmas,” she said. “we don’t go into it thinking, ‘this is going to be huge,’ just getting something right for the brand at this time of year and something we hope customers really love.”sarah vizard, news editor of trade journal marketing week, said john lewis appeared to have simplified efforts this time, with a lower-key presence in stores despite a growing number of competitors. “there are definitely a lot more brands doing christmas ads this year but i think a lot of those brands who tried to compete with john lewis by doing something emotional and creative have gone back to what you can buy in store,” she said. “john lewis still does the emotional piece the best. this campaign is another great way of communicating that in a way that customers can relate to. i think people will think it is really cute.”nannannannan

intermediate	music subscription services, including spotify and deezer, have broken through the $1bn sales barrier worldwide, as fans choose to pay for music online.streaming and subscription revenues rose by more than 50% in 2013 to reach $1.1bn, and sales of recorded music in europe grew for the  rst time in 12 years, according to  gures published in march.while many people still listen for free, a desire for more choice is persuading more music lovers to part with their cash. in a three-year period, the number of paying subscribers rose from 8 million to 28 million, according to the 2014 digital music report from the international federation of the phonographic industry (ifpi).easily accessible from smartphones and tablets, subscription services are popular with people who want to try out new music without buying a download or a cd. they like this cheap, user-friendly and legal alternative to pirated downloads. òit is now clear that music streaming and subscription is a mainstream model for our business,ó said ifpi chief executive, frances moore.the ifpi also said that one direction were the biggest selling artists of 2013, with 4m physical and digital sales for their midnight memories album. katy perryõs prism was the best-selling album by a female artist, in sixth place behind eminem, justin timberlake, bruno mars and daft punk.consumer-technology companies are joining the music-streaming trend. apple has its itunes radio and google its play store. smaller companies like beats music are also joining the trend.in britain and america, streaming may soon generate more revenue for the music industry than downloads from online stores such as appleõs itunes. subscription services now account for a third of all digital sales globally, with downloads making up the rest, but the ifpi data shows that the two formats are growing at different rates.in the us, the percentage of people using subscription services and streaming rose from 19% in 2012 to 23%, while the percentage of people downloading fell from 28% to 27%. in britain, downloaders remained static at exactly one third, while subscribers grew from 19% to 22%. in sweden, france and italy, streaming is already more popular than downloading.digital formats now account for 39% of all music sales, or nearly £5.9bn out of £15bn, and, while sales of physical formats, such as cds and vinyl, declined steeply in 2013, they still contribute just over half the industryõs income.vinyl continued to make a comeback in some markets. sales increased by 32% in america and by 101% in the uk in 2013.
intermediate	a canadian man who became famous because he offered a free round-the-world trip to a woman with the same name as his ex-girlfriend has returned from the trip with his chosen namesake. unfortunately, to the disappointment of those following the story, the two of them did not fall in love. jordan axani, a 28-year-old toronto charity founder, arrived back in canada with elizabeth quinn gallagher and said the pair had “a brother-sister-like relationship”.axani had made headlines in 2014 because he offered an air ticket to any canadian named elizabeth gallagher. he had booked a three-week vacation with his girlfriend but they split up and he was unable to change the name on the flight tickets.that’s where axani’s new travelling companion, a 23-year-old student from cole harbour, nova scotia, enters the story. elizabeth gallagher, who calls herself quinn, replied to an online posting from axani and she was chosen. gallagher explained before the trip that she had a “pretty serious” boyfriend. but that had not stopped journalists from hoping the globetrotters might fall for one another. unfortunately, it did not happen.“i’m going to be very clear,” axani said, soon after the pair returned to toronto. “this was never a romantic endeavour. it was strictly platonic. i do not think of quinn in a romantic way at all. there is no future for us romantically. she is a good friend. i think of her as a little sister and that is it. and our feelings are entirely mutual.”it took work to create that brother-sister, good-friend relationship, however. “it wasn’t easy and it certainly wasn’t immediate. it took us about a week to really figure each other out,” axani said. there was a certain amount of stumbling around as the pair got to know each other “about the dos and don’ts of travelling together. at the end of it, we’d developed a really great rhythm – one second, we had really funny inside jokes and, the next second, we knew when the other person needed space.”although the pair did not fall in love, axani said the trip, which included milan, venice, vienna, prague, khao lak (in thailand) and hong kong, was “fantastic”. a favourite place was prague, axani said, where they met more people than anywhere else on the trip.“over the course of two and a half days i think we met about two dozen people. so that’s a lot of stories, that’s a lot of individuals and that’s a lot of love for their home city of prague.”people were following the pair on twitter and instagram, axani said, and they were even recognized in the street in hong kong. “it was a real adventure. we had a blast. we learned a lot about ourselves and about each other. i can’t imagine it going much better than it did.”axani arrived back in toronto at 3am and went straight into a meeting at his charity, a ticket forward. axani started the non-profit organization after his internet post went viral. he wants to offer round-the-world-trips to survivors of abuse, cancer and war.apart from that, axani is also discussing making his story into a television show or film, he said. but he would not comment on what form those productions might take. “i’ll only say that there’s been lots of interest from many production companies. we’re well advanced.” in terms of his love life, axani said he was not looking for his next elizabeth gallagher yet. “i’m not looking for anything but life happens and we’ll see,” he said. “as always, life’s a journey.”
intermediate	a mirror that sends heat into cold space has been designed by scientists to replace air-conditioning units that keep buildings cool on earth.researchers believe the mirror could slash the amount of energy used to control air temperatures in business premises and shopping centres because they wonõt need to use cooling systems.around 15% of the energy used by buildings in the usgoesonairconditioningbuttheresearchersõ say that, in some cases, the mirror could completely offset the need for extra cooling.in a rooftop comparison in stanford, california, scientists found that a roof that had been painted black reached 60c more than the air temperature in sunlight and aluminium reached 40c more. however, the mirror was up to 5c cooler than the surrounding air temperature.òif you cover signi cant parts of the roof with this mirror, you can see how much power it can save. you can signi cantly offset the electricity used for air conditioning,ó said shanhui fan, an expert in the study of light at stanford university, who led the development of the mirror. òin some situations, you will be able to completely offset the air conditioning.óbuildings warm up in a number of different ways. hot-water boilers and cooking areas release heat into their immediate surroundings. in hot countries, warm air comes in through doors and windows. then, there is visible light and infrared radiation from the sun, which also heat up buildings.the stanford mirror was designed to re ect 97% of the visible light that falls on it. but, more importantly, it works as a thermal radiator. when the mirror is warmed up, it releases heat at a speci c wavelength of infrared light that passes easily through the atmosphere and out into space.to make anything cool, you need what engineers call a heat sink: somewhere to put unwanted heat. the heat sink has to be cooler than the object that needs cooling or it will not do its job. for example, a bucket of ice will cool a bottle of wine because it becomes a sink for heat in the liquid. the stanford mirror relies on the best heat sink: the universe itself.the mirror is built from several layers of very thin materials. the  rst layer is re ective silver. on top of this are layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide. these layers turn the mirror into a thermal radiator. when silicon dioxide heats up, it radiates the heat as infrared light at a wavelength of around ten micrometres and the heat passes straight out to space. the total thickness of the mirror is around two micrometres or two thousandths of a millimetre.òthe cold darkness of the universe can be used as a renewable thermodynamic resource, even during the hottest hours of the day,ó the scientists write in nature. in tests, the mirror had a cooling power of 40 watts per square metre at outside temperatures. writinginthejournal,fansaysthatthecostofthe mirrors is between $20 and $70 per square metre. he calculates an annual electricity saving of 100mwh on a three-storey building.fan said that the mirror could cool buildings but he said that the mirrors would not slow down global warming. òroof space is only a small portion of the earthõs surface so the mirror is not a solution to the problem of global warming. but our mirror will help limit greenhouse gas emissions by reducing electricity consumption,ó he said.òiõm really excited by the potential it has,ó said marin solja__i__, a physicist at the massachusetts institute of technology. òyou could use this on buildings and spend much less money on air conditioning or maybe you wouldnõt need it at all. you could put it on top of shopping malls.ó òiõm really excited by the potential it has,ó said marin solja__i__, a physicist at the massachusetts institute of technology. òyou could use this on buildings and spend much less money on air conditioning or maybe you wouldnõt need it at all. you could put it on top of shopping malls.ó òiõm really excited by the potential it has,ó said marin solja__i__, a physicist at the massachusetts institute of technology. òyou could use this on buildings and spend much less money on air conditioning or maybe you wouldnõt need it at all. you could put it on top of shopping malls.ó nan
intermediate	according to a new census, there are more tigers in nepal than at any time since the 1970s. this has given conservationists hope that the big cats, whose numbers have been dropping across south asia for 100 years, can be saved.the number of wild royal bengal tigers in nepal has increased to 198 – a 63.6% rise in five years – the government survey showed. “this is very good news,” said maheshwar dhakal, an ecologist with nepal’s department of national parks and wildlife conservation.the census is based on the examination of pictures from more than 500 cameras in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors. more than 250 conservationists and wildlife experts worked on the survey, which cost about £250,000. dhakal said that a similar survey was done in india and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013. “it will take a few more months for india, which now has 1,300 big cats in several huge protected areas, to finish the survey,” he added. nepal has promised to double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 when the last systematic tiger count took place.increasing wealth in asia has led to higher prices for tiger skins and the body parts used in traditional chinese medicines. international gangs pay poor local nepali large amounts of money to kill the cats. the skin and bones are given to middlemen, who pass easily through the border with india, where the major dealers are based.one major problem is that some senior officials help mafia networks involved in the trade. conservation experts believe that the increase in tiger numbers is the result of better policing of national parks and better management of tiger habitats in nepal, where forests cover 29% of the land. but they say nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers feed so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat.as the number of tigers has increased over the years, conflict with villagers has increased, too. seven people were killed in attacks by tigers around national parks in 2012 compared to four in 2011, park officials said. villagers also want better protection. “the government is making conservation plans for tigers. but it should also produce plans to protect people from tigers,” krishna bhurtel, a village headman, told a nepali newspaper. wildlife authorities captured a tiger after it killed two people, including a villager who was pulled from his bed in may.thousands of tigers once roamed the forests in bangladesh, india and nepal. but their numbers have dropped to about 3,000, a 95% drop over a century. chitwan national park in central nepal has the highest number of adult tigers, with 120, followed by bardiya national park (50) and shukla phanta wildlife reserve (17).diwakar chapagain, head of a world wildlife fund nepal unit that monitors wildlife trade, said tiger skins were in demand in tibet, where rich people use them as festival costumes.in nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins for special occasions. some wealthy nepali have tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms. tiger bones are used in traditional chinese medicines. “the trade in tiger parts is lucrative and fetches thousands of dollars in illegal markets,” chapagain said.
intermediate	not many exercise classes have a tea break halfway through. but margaret allen’s does. after a gentle warm-up and a few quick exercises, the 93-year-old great-grandmother lets her group relax with a cup of tea and a quick rest.some of the class of eight look as if they need to rest more than others. allen herself, wearing a thick shirt, knitted waistcoat, slacks and sensible shoes, is not even sweating. despite an extremely painful trapped nerve in one leg and a knee in need of replacement, she looks like she could go on for hours.the general rule is that eating just before doing sport is not a good idea and especially not halfway through the class. but, on the afternoon i visit allen’s class in saltburn-by-the-sea near middlesbrough, slices of fruitcake are being passed around during the break. the cake has been baked to celebrate allen’s recent birthday by her 89-year-old sister, joan.the ladies have just finished their cake when allen is up again, leading the group through a lively scottish tune with lots of toe pointing and leg kicking. forty-five minutes later, the class is finally over.allen, a former volunteer with the charity red cross, has been leading classes in the north-east town for 45 years. she wasn’t particularly sporty at school, but she started playing the piano for a keep-fit class during the second world war and eventually took over in her 40s when the previous instructor retired.at one time, allen’s class had more than 18 regulars, each paying £1 a time. but, these days, the group is getting smaller – during the tea break, the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them had attended that week for one of the younger members of the group who had just died, aged 68.allen is the oldest, followed by her sister. the baby of the group is 60-year-old jean cunion, who is a bit embarrassed to admit that she is perhaps the least fit of the group. “i remember, the first time i came, margaret said, ‘who’s that huffing and panting?’ and i had to admit it was me.” ruth steere, 76, says allen always knows what’s going on, although her back is always to the class: “she always shouts at us if we go wrong. she’s remarkably good at knowing what we are doing.”allen, a keen dancer, has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor. instead, she choreographs her own moves based on five tapes from the bbc’s first ever fitness guru, eileen fowler. allen thinks her good health is largely a result of keeping busy, especially since her husband died in 1997. she started writing poetry when she was 80.“i write poems about everything. i’m a prolific writer. i just can’t stop,” she says, when she phones me a few days after the interview to read out a poem she has written about the joys of exercise. one of the class, 84-year-old former teacher winnie robertson, thinks the secret to staying fit is never letting yourself go: “use it or lose it, that’s what i say.”allen still plays the piano and gives speeches. she did a computer course when she was 88. ageing is no fun, she admits, reading me a few lines from a poem she has written called ‘that beast called age’. she happily remembers a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years ago, who said she couldn’t possibly be more than 78: “i said, ‘thank you, doctor. you can go now.’”she also has a no-nonsense attitude to weight gain: “i just think people shouldn’t eat too much. whenever i hear someone saying, ‘oh, i can’t lose weight’, i say: ‘sellotape.’” she mimes taping her mouth shut. “i said this just the other day to a big fat man. everything in moderation is my motto.”earlier in 2013, allen was watching the news and saw a woman being given the british empire medal. “she was saying: ‘i’m 80 and i’m the oldest fitness instructor in the country!’ i was thinking: ‘no, you’re not.’ but i shan’t be writing to buckingham palace.”nan
intermediate	clay cockrell is sitting in his of ce across the street from 1 central park west, the address of the trump international hotel and tower. in front of the tower is central park, where cockrell holds his popular walk and talk therapy sessions.cockrell, a former wall street worker who is now a therapist, spends large parts of his days walking through central park or the battery park in downtown manhattan near wall street, as a con dant and counsellor to some of new yorkõs wealthiest peopleòmany of the extremely wealthy ð the 1% of the 1% ð feel that their problems are really not problems. but they are,ó he says.so, what issues do americaõs 1% have? òthere is guilt because they are rich,ó he said. òthere is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich. and, then, there is the isolation ð being in the 1% can be lonely.ócounsellors argue that things have become worse since the  nancial crisis and the discussion about income inequality brought on by movements like occupy wall street.òthe occupy wall street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% as something negative,ó said jamie traeger-muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the wealth legacy group. the media, she said, is partly to blame for making the rich òfeel like they need to hide or feel ashamedó.traeger-muney runs a global business and specializes in working with inheritors, who often get a bad reputation in the press. òsometimes, i am shocked by things that people say. you would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealthy people.óòitõs really isolating to have a lot of money. peopleõs reactions to you can be scary,ó said barbara nusbaum, an expert in money psychology. òwe are all taught not to talk about money. itõs not polite to talk about money. but itõs harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money. itõs much more socially acceptable to say ôi am broke. things are hard.õ you canõt say ôi have a ton of money.õ you have to keep a lot of your life private.óas a result, cockrell says, the rich usually hang out with other rich americans who understand them and their problems.in the us, over the last three decades, the number of extremely wealthy people has been increasing. according to research from spectrem group, in 2014, the number of us households with $1m or more ð excluding the value of their main home ð increased by 500,000 to 10.1m. households worth $5m or more reached 1.3m and 142,000 households are now worth $25m or more.since the 2008  nancial crisis, the income gap has grown and the situation òhas gotten worse for the wealthyó, cockrell said. the main reason? not knowing if your friends are friends with you or with your money.òsomeone else who is also a billionaire ð they donõt want anything from you. never being able to trust your friendships with other people, i think that is dif cult,ó said cockrell. òas the gap has widened, the rich have become more and more isolated.óthese are real fears of the richest of the rich. in 2007, the gates foundation and boston collegeõs center on wealth and philanthropy started to document what it felt like to be in americaõs 1%. for the next four years, researchers surveyed 165 of americaõs richest households ð 120 of those households have at least $25m. the report, the joys and dilemmas of wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old saying that money canõt buy happiness.òwealth can stop you from connecting with other people,ó said the wife of a tech entrepreneur who made about $80m. some americans keep their wealth secret. òwe talk about it as stealth wealth. there are a lot of people that hide their wealth because they are worried about negative judgment,ó said traeger-muney. if wealthy americans talk about the problems that come with their wealth, people often say ôoh, poor you.õ there is not a lot of sympathy there,ó she said.speaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to tell him all your worries, cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money define them.òif you are part of the 1%, you still have problems and they are real to you. even when you say, ôi donõt have to struggle for moneyõ, there are other parts of your life. money is not the only thing that de nes you,ó he said. òyour problems are real.ó nannannannan
elementary	lego’s profits rose strongly in the first half of 2014, helped by the success of its lego movie in the us and uk.the danish toy company sold a lot more products in europe, north and south america, and asia as children bought products linked to the film. the film took more than $250 million in the us and £31 million in the uk between february and april 2014.the movie cost about $60 million to make. it is entertaining and aimed at people who are likely to buy the company’s products.lego’s finance director, john goodwin, said that the lego movie products had a positive effect on profits during the first half of 2014. they are now waiting to see what will happen after the movie comes out on dvd in the second half of 2014.jørgen vig knudstorp, lego’s chief executive, said that lego were very happy that they have sold more products in the first half of 2014. he said this was a result of lego’s ability to develop, launch and distribute lego products, which children all over the world put at the top of their wishlists.lego, based in the small town of billund in denmark, started producing its plastic bricks in 1949 and became a popular and well-known children’s toy around the world by the 1970s.in 2003, the company nearly collapsed. then, knudstrop became lego’s new chief executive. he got rid of hundreds of products and, then, refocused the business on its bricks.the company opened its first factory in china in april 2014.
elementary	governments in europe dream of  nding a magic solution to rising unemployment. but, in the poorest parts of the eu, unemployment continues to rise.now, in sardinia, italy, a mayor thinks he has found an answer to his townõs unemployment problem. valter piscedda, the mayor of elmas, a small town near sardiniaõs capital, cagliari, wants to pay residents to leave. the town will pay for ten unemployed local people to take english lessons, get on a cheap  ight and look for jobs in other parts of europe.òthis idea comes from common sense and experience,ó he told the guardian. òin the past year and a half ð especially in the past few months ð i have seen young people, almost every day, who have lost hope that they will  nd work. some ask for help in  nding work here. others have tried everything and, now, they want to go and gain work experience abroad; life experience, too.óso he decided to help people who want to gain experience abroad.sardinia, and also much of southern and central italy, is struggling with high unemployment. unemployment was at 17.7% in the second quarter of 2014, according to italyõs national institute of statistics. more than 54% of people under 25 are out of work.for the adesso parto (now iõm leaving) programme, elmas will give û12,000 to the  rst ten applicants aged between 18 and 50. the applicants must be out of work and have lived in the town for three years. they do not have to be university educated and they must not earn more than û15,000.the idea of helping people to leave is sensitive at a time when many italians ð many of them clever young graduates ð are leaving their country every year. but piscedda believes that the people he is sending away might return òand give me back 100 times what we gave themó. more importantly, he wants the scheme to help the people most in need.in elmas, the scheme has got mixed reactions. òthere is little work here,ó said alessandro macis. òthe opportunity to go abroad to learn about the workplace and experience other cultures can be very worthwhile. the son of a friend of mine who didnõt study much is in london and heõs doing very well. he started as a waiter. now, heõs a cook and heõs learning english.óothers were not sure. i heard about it but i thought it was strange. if you have that money to pay for people to go away, why dont you use that money to keep them here? said consuelo melis, who works in a local cafe.but piscedda says, òthe work i can create, as mayor, is temporary. i can ask someone to clean a piazza. i can ask them to clean it again. i can ask someone to clean the streets. but these are all temporary things that give nothing more than a little bit of money for a few months.ónannannan
elementary	you’ve spent eight hours in the office. you’ve finished the most important work of the day. this is the time when most workers would think about going home.but, for millions of japanese employees, if they leave work and arrive home in time for dinner, people say that they are disloyal to their company.but now, the government is trying to do something about japan’s culture of overwork. it wants to make workers take at least five days’ paid holiday a year.japanese employees are allowed an average of 18.5 days’ paid holiday a year. companies must allow them a minimum of ten days’ paid holiday, plus 15 one-day national holidays. but very few employees take these days. most take only nine days of holiday, according to the labour ministry. many british workers think that a two-week summer holiday is their right but workers in japan think that a four-night vacation in hawaii is a big self-indulgence.by 2020, the government hopes that the law will make japanese employees follow the example of british workers, who take an average of 20 days’ paid annual leave, and workers in france, who take an average of 25.japan’s employees are respected and admired in the rest of the world for their commitment to the company. but they often have no time for anything else.couples don’t have time to start families. so, japan has a low birth rate and the population is declining. more employees are falling ill from stress or even dying through overwork.about 22% of japanese work more than 49 hours a week, compared with 16% of us workers and 11% in france and germany, according to data from the japanese government.“nobody else uses their vacation days,” says erika sekiguchi, a 36-year-old worker. she spends 14 hours a day at work and used only eight of her 20 days of paid vacation in 2014, six of which were sick leave.yuu wakebe, who works at the health ministry, admits that he does 100 hours of overtime a month. “it is a worker’s right to take paid vacations,” wakebe said. “but workers in japan have to do a lot of extra work for no money.”workers are scared that their colleagues will think they are not working hard enough. this is one reason for a rise in stress-related illness, early death and suicide. about 200 people die every year from heart attacks and strokes in japan, caused by long hours and hard work.nannannannan
elementary	the vice-president of google has warned that digitized material from blogs, tweets, pictures, videos and official documents such as emails could be lost forever because the programs we need to view them will no longer exist. our first steps into the digital world could be lost to future historians, vint cerf told the american association for the advancement of science’s annual meeting. he said that we might become a “forgotten generation or even a forgotten century” because of “bit rot”, where old computer files become useless junk.cerf said we should develop digital methods to preserve old software and hardware to read old files. “so much of the information about our daily lives is in digital form, like our interactions by email, people’s tweets and all of the world wide web. so it’s clear that we could lose a lot of our history,” he said. “if we want to keep it, we need to make sure that people can still see the digital objects we create today in the future,” he added.what is ‘bit rot’ and is vint cerf right to be worried? his warning highlights an irony about modern technology: we digitize music, photos, letters and other documents so that they survive for centuries but the programs and hardware people will need to read those files don’t survive.“we are throwing all of our data into an information black hole. we digitize things because we think we will preserve them. but what we don’t understand is that, if we don’t do something, those digital versions may not be any better than the things that we digitized. in fact, they may be worse,” cerf says. “if there are photos you really care about, print them out.”ancient civilizations did not have these problems because people wrote histories down and we need only eyes to read them. to study today’s culture, future historians will have to read pdfs, word documents and hundreds of other file types, using special software and sometimes hardware, too.the problem is already here. in the 1980s, it was normal to save documents on floppy disks and buy computer games on cassettes. even if the disks and cassettes are in good condition, we can now only find the equipment to view them in museums.cerf warns that we will also lose important political and historical documents because of bit rot. in 2005, american historian doris kearns goodwin wrote a book about abraham lincoln. she went to libraries around the us and found the paper letters of the people involved. “in today’s world, those letters would be emails and it will be almost impossible to find them one hundred years from now,” said cerf.he admits that historians will try to preserve important material. but he says that people often don’t understand the importance of documents until hundreds of years later. historians have learned how archimedes thought about infinity in 3bc because they found his writings hidden under the words of a thirteenth-century book. “we’ve been surprised by what we’ve learned from objects that have been preserved by accident,” he said.researchers in pittsburgh are trying to find a solution to bit rot. they are creating a computer that can read old files.inventing new technology helps but it is only part of the solution. it could be even more difficult to get the legal permissions to copy and store software before it dies. “to do this properly, we might need to think about things like copyright. we’re talking about preserving documents for hundreds to thousands of years,” said cerf.
elementary	barack obama has told young people to reject pessimism and meet people who have different political beliefs if they want to change the world.on the last day of his last visit to britain as us president, obama told 500 youth leaders at a meeting in london: “reject the idea that there are things we can’t control. as jfk said, our problems are manmade and can be solved by man.”“you’ve never had better tools to make a difference,” he told the students at the question-and-answer session. “reject pessimism and know that progress is possible.”but obama said he knew that young people had many challenges. he said it was a time of great change, with 9/11, 7/7, and with so much information and bad news, for example on twitter.the president told the audience to meet and talk with people who have different political beliefs: “look for people who don’t agree with you and it will also help you to compromise.”obama said he was proud of his healthcare reforms and talked about the 2008 financial crisis: “i saved the world from depression – that was quite good.”he also said that his talks with iran and the response to the ebola crisis were some of the best things about his presidency.tanya williams, a community officer, said: “i like barack obama and it’s exciting to hear someone who has changed so much.”oliver sidorczuk, 26, said: “everyone is extremely excited to listen to what he has to say.”furqan naeem, from manchester, said: “i recently visited the united states and i saw some really important work the president did – the work brought different people together.”later, obama met labour party leader, jeremy corbyn, who said they had an “excellent” 90-minute discussion. they also talked about britain’s membership of the eu.after the meeting, obama played golf with british prime minister, david cameron. obama had dinner with cameron and the us ambassador, matthew barzun, and, then, travelled to germany.nannannannannannannannannan
elementary	passing clouds one of the good things about flying is seeing clouds very close. they seem to be light, but they carry a lot of water – around 500 tonnes in a small cloud. and water is heavier than air. so why don’t clouds fall out of the sky like rain? they do, but they take a very long time. an average cloud would take a year to fall one metre.on cloud nine most of us are happy to call clouds “fluffy ones” or “nasty black ones”, but there are more than 50 cloud types. the 50 cloud types fit into nine categories. cloud nine is the very big cumulonimbus, so to be “on cloud nine” means that you are on top of the world or very, very happy.around the rainbow the best place to see a rainbow is from a plane. rainbows are made when sunlight hits raindrops. we see a bow because the earth is in the way, but, from a plane, a rainbow is a complete circle.mr blue sky sunlight is white. it includes all the colours of the spectrum. as it passes through air, some of the light is scattered. blue light scatters more than other colours, so the blue looks like it comes from the sky.there’s life out there we usually only see clouds and other planes from a flying aircraft’s window, but the air is full of bacteria – 1,800 different types of bacteria.turbulence terror even someone who flies all the time can feel sick because of turbulence. the good news is that no modern airliner has ever crashed because of these sudden and violent movements of air. people have been hurt when they are not strapped in or falling luggage may hit them – but the plane is not going to fall out of the sky.you can’t cure jet lag the world is divided into time zones. when you take a long flight, the difference between local time and your body’s time causes jet lag. but jet lag can be reduced if you keep food bland for 24 hours before travel, drink a lot and live on your destination time from the moment you get on the aircraft.supersonic 747s many of us have travelled faster than sound. there are many jet streams in the air around the earth, especially on the journey from the us to europe. a jet stream can move as fast as 250 miles per hour. if an airliner flying at 550mph enters a jet stream, the result can be that the plane flies at 800mph. that’s faster than the speed of sound.flying through time flying across time zones means that we travel through time. but this time travel is so small that crossing the atlantic every week for 40 years would only move you 1/1,000th of a second into the future.terrible tea don’t blame the cabin attendant if your tea isn’t great. water should be just under 100°c when you pour it on to tea leaves – but that isn’t possible on a plane. it’s impossible to get water hotter than 90°c during flight – so choose coffee.i can’t hear my food people often say that airline food is bland and without taste. but some of the problem may not be bad food. a plane is a noisy place and food loses some of its taste when there are loud noises.needle in a haystack with modern technology, it seems strange that malaysian flight mh370 could disappear – but finding a missing aircraft is a needle-in-ahaystack problem. the plane knows where it is but it does not send this information anywhere. the problem is not technology – the problem is that there is no law that says that planes must send this information.volcanic fallout air travel can be cancelled by volcanic activity. ash melts in the heat of the engine, then solidifies on the rotors. it is very dangerous to ignore the volcanic ash.the wing myth for many years, we taught the wrong explanation for the way wings keep planes in the air. but now we know that a plane stays in the air because of newton’s third law of motion. the shape of the wing pushes air down. as the air is pushed down, the wing gets an equal and opposite push up, and this lifts the plane.nannannannan
elementary	we do not yet live in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm back to the future ii, but smartphones and other new technologies are creating exciting possibilities. experts agree that economic and population changes, new technology, and environmental concerns are having a big effect on transportation.with an ageing transport infrastructure, cities in the us have to change and improve their transportation. experts and scientists now realize that old ways of reducing traf c congestion arenõt enough to solve the problems of population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now an environmental problem.big us cities like los angeles and chicago are adding more bus lanes and pedestrian walkways, and expanding rail networks. at the same time, they are creating advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment.here are three of the key ideas that experts predict will change transportation in the future.connectivity taxi-sharing services like uber and apps like waze, which  nds the quickest routes for drivers, are completely changing how people move around and affecting the way traf c moves through a city. communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era.according to a recent study, people born in the 1990s are using cars less than older generations. according to the study, people born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than older generations did at the same time in their lives. and, people who still drive cars are experiencing less traf c thanks to waze.traf c congestion is improving in other ways, too. at the moment, a traf c light knows when a car is getting close but thatõs all. companies are developing technology that allows a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.automation we have known about driverless cars ever since google began testing the vehicles in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. but, there is already some automation of cars. automation will probably happen in stages:  rst, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: vehicles that are connected electronically and travel one behind another.the idea of a fully automated transportation system is interesting because it could improve safety ð peopleõs mistakes wonõt cause accidents any more. it could also help reduce carbon emissions and traf c congestion. but, it will take a long time to get fully automated because the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.to see what driverless cars might look like on the road, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.environmental concern the world is trying to slow down climate change and countries and cities are trying to reduce emissions. these things could have a big effect on the future of transportation and lead to zero- and low-emission vehicles and apps that encourage more walking, cycling and carpooling. when thinking about the future of transportation, itõs also important to think about why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. technologies that reduce the need for those trips ð for example, online meetings or online work ð could also have a big effect on transportation.nannannan
elementary	on the market square in rjukan stands a statue of the person who created the town, a norwegian engineer and businessman called sam eyde. the great man looks north across the square at the side of a mountain in front of him.behind him, to the south, is the 1,800-metre mountain known as gaustatoppen. between the mountains, along the narrow vestfjord valley, is the small town that eyde built at the beginning of the last century for his factory workers.eyde used the power of the 100-metre rjukanfossen waterfall to make hydroelectricity in what was, at that time, the world’s biggest power plant.but one thing he couldn’t do was change the sun. deep in its east–west valley, with high mountains all around, rjukan and the 3,400 people who live there are in shadow for half the year. in the daytime, from late september to mid-march, the town, three hours north-west of oslo, is not completely dark, but it’s certainly not bright.now, high on the mountain opposite eyde’s statue, 450 metres above the town, three large, solar-powered, computer-controlled mirrors follow the movement of the sun across the sky. they reflect the sunshine down on to the square and fill it in bright sunlight.“it’s the sun!” says ingrid sparbo – she lifts her face to the light and closes her eyes. sparbo has lived all her life in rjukan and says, “this is so warming. not just physically, but mentally. it’s mentally warming.”two young mothers bring their children into the square and stand in the sun. on a freezing day, an elderly couple sit on one of the new benches and they smile at the warmth on their faces. children smile. lots of people take photographs. a shop assistant, silje johansen, says it’s “awesome. just awesome.”electrical engineer eivind toreid says “it’s a funny thing. not real sunlight, but very similar. like a spotlight.”heidi fieldheim says she heard all about it on the radio. “this will bring much happiness,” she says.across the road, in the nye tider café, sits the man who created this happiness. martin andersen is a 40-year-old artist who moved to rjukan in the summer of 2001.andersen had the idea for an artwork he calls the solspeil, or sun mirror, at the end of september one year: “every day, we took our young child for a walk,” he says, “and, every day, i realized we had to go a little further down the valley to find the sun.” by 28 september, the sun completely disappears from rjukan’s market square. it doesn’t reappear until 12 march.in the months between september and march, andersen says: “we would look up and see blue sky above, and the sun high on the mountain, but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town.”twelve years after he first dreamed of his solspeil, a german company that specializes in csp – concentrated solar power – brought in, by helicopter, the three 17-square-metre glass mirrors that are now high above the market square in rjukan.and it really works. some people were against the mirrors at first, but now even they agree that it works“i was strongly against it,” says nils eggerud. like many others, he felt they needed the money for other things – for extra carers to look after rjukan’s old people, perhaps, or better schools, cycle paths and roads.“and i still don’t know about the maintenance costs,” he says. “what will they be, who will pay them? but ... well, it feels nice, standing here. and, really, you just have to look at the people’s faces.”in his office with a view of the square, rjukan’s young mayor, steinar bergsland, is less interested in the cost and more interested in the benefits the mirrors might bring to the town.already, bergsland says, there are more visitors than usual and rjukan’s shopkeepers are making more money than usual.the town had to pay just 1 million krone – £100,000 – of the mirror’s total 5-million krone cost. the rest came from the government and a local business. “and”, says bergsland, “just look out of the window. look at those happy faces. now it’s here, people love it.”nan
elementary	a new computer-assisted autopsy system is becoming more and more popular in european hospitals. its inventor says that the system could mean that now there will be no such thing as a ‘perfect murder’.the method, called ‘virtopsy’, is being used at some forensic medical institutes in europe. it was invented by a group of scientists at the university of zurich. instead of cutting the chest, like in a traditional autopsy, pathologists are now able to examine the dead body in 3-d via computer screens.michael thali, the director of zurich’s institute for forensic medicine in europe, and one of the inventors of virtopsy, said it could completely change criminal investigations. “basically there will be no such thing as the perfect murder any more because a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence,” he said.virtopsies use powerful machines. together, the machines are called a ‘virtobot’. virtopsies can find injuries that are not seen during a traditional autopsy, as well as air pockets, heart attacks and even cancer.“the virtopsy could replace the autopsy one day,” said richard dirndorfer, one of the first people to use dna analysis in criminology. “i think we’ll see it happen slowly, just like dna analysis slowly replaced blood group analysis”.the method allows doctors to see deep inside dead bodies. it can see things that cannot be found during traditional autopsies.criminologists from around the world have been travelling to switzerland over the past few years to see the new method. forensic scientists and pathologists think the method can be used together with the traditional autopsy.“in order to analyze the colour of the blood, the thickness of body fluids or smells, we’ll need to use traditional autopsy methods,” said lars oesterhelweg, deputy director of the institute of forensic medicine at the charité hospital in berlin, which is using a version of the virtopsy.he added that the new method was very helpful in re-examining cases where the cause of death was unclear. “it means that investigations can be re-examined and we can try again to find the murderer,” he said.scientists said that relatives of the dead prefer the virtopsy method because, during a traditional autopsy, scientists have to cut and damage the dead body.nannan
elementary	tea, baked beans on toast and fish and chips have always been popular in britain. but, things are changing, according to data published recently in the national food survey.everyone knows that the british love tea but they drink more than 50% less tea than in the 1970s – 68g of tea per person per week compared to only 25g. britons are now drinking on average only eight cups of tea a week – they drank 23 cups in 1974. tea is still the most popular hot drink in the uk but people now spend more money on coffee.the data comes from 150,000 families who took part in the survey between 1974 and 2000, combined with information from 2000 to 2014. it shows a move towards healthier food in recent years – people have changed to low-calorie soft drinks, from whole to skimmed milk and they eat more fresh fruit. but, the amount of chips, pizza, crisps and ready meals they eat each week has increased a lot.there has also been an enormous change from white to brown bread. the survey also shows the amount of bread people eat has fallen from 25 to 15 slices a week over the past forty years. the amount of baked beans people eat has reduced by 20%. but, there has been an increase in other types of convenience food, particularly italian dishes. adults in the uk now eat an average of 75g of pizza every week compared with none in 1974. the amount of pasta they eat has almost tripled over the same period.fresh potatoes are also becoming less popular with a 67% decrease from 1974, when adults ate around 188g every day. people eat more of other vegetables such as cucumbers, courgettes, aubergines and mushrooms. the amount of takeaway food they eat has almost doubled since 1974, from 80g per person per week to 150g. around 33g of this amount is chips and 56g is meat, with kebabs (10g), chicken (7g), burgers (5g) and “meat-based meals” (32g) particularly popular.it seems that british people are now more careful about what they eat – the amount of fruit has increased by 50% since 1974. in 2014, uk adults ate an average of 157g of fruit per day. bananas have been the most popular fruit in the uk since 1996 – adults ate 221g per adult per week in 2014, much more than apples (131g) and oranges (48g). half of all soft drinks british people drink are now low-calorie soft drinks. britons also spend a smaller percentage of their salaries on food today – 11%, compared with 24% in 1974.the uk environment secretary, elizabeth truss, said: “food is the heart of our society. this data shows what we were eating 40 years ago but, also, how a change in culture has led to a food revolution. people care more about where their food comes from than before, we can order quality food on the internet, fashionable restaurants give us the latest trends and exciting global cuisines are now as common as fish and chips.”she added that this data can show us more than what, where or how older generations ate. it can also show us when our habits changed. the national food survey can tell us a lot and help us to predict new food trends. “i look forward to seeing how we can use this data to learn more about our past and grow our world-leading food and farming industry in the future,” she said.nan
advanced	"clay cockrell is sitting in his of ce at columbus circle, across the street from 1 central park west, which houses trump international hotel and tower. in front of the tower is central park, where cockrell holds his popular walk and talk therapy sessions.cockrell, a former wall street worker turned therapist, spends large parts of his days walking through central park or the battery park in downtown manhattan near wall street, as a con dant and counsellor to some of new yorkõs wealthiest people.òi shifted towards it naturally,ó he said of his becoming an expert in wealth therapy. òmany of the extremely wealthy ð the 1% of the 1% ð feel that their problems are really not problems. but they are. a lot of therapists do not give enough weight to their issues.óso, what issues are americaõs 1% struggling with? òthere is guilt over being rich in the  rst place,ó he said. òthere is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich. and, then, there is the isolation ð being in the 1%, it turns out, can be lonely.ó it seems f scott fitzgerald was right: the very rich òare different from you and meó.counsellors argue things have become worse since the  nancial crisis and the debate over income inequality that has been spurred on by movements like occupy wall street and the fight for $15 fair wage campaign.òthe occupy wall street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% and painted them globally as something negative,ó said jamie traeger-muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the wealth legacy group. the media, she said, is partly to blame for making the rich òfeel like they need to hide or feel ashamedó.traeger-muney runs a global  rm and specializes in working with inheritors, who often get a bad reputation in the press. òyou can come up with lots of words and sayings about inheritors ð not one of them is positive: spoilt brat, born with a silver spoon in their mouth, trust-fund babies, all these things,ó she said, adding that itõs òeasy to scapegoat the richó.òsometimes, i am shocked by things that people say. you would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealth holders.óòitõs really isolating to have a lot of money. peopleõs reactions to you can be scary,ó said barbara nusbaum, an expert in money psychology. òwe are all taught not to talk about money. itõs not polite to talk about money. ironically, itõs harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money. itõs much more socially acceptable to say ôi am broke. things are hard.õ you canõt say ôi have a ton of money.õ you have to keep a lot of your life private.óas a result, cockrell points out, the rich tend to hang out with other rich americans, not out of snobbery but in order to be around those who understand them and their problems.the growing gap between the rich and poor is a global phenomenon. according to oxfam, the richest 1% have seen their share of global wealth increase from 44% in 2009 to 48% in 2014 and are on track to own more than the other 99% by 2016.in the us, over the last three decades, the wealth owned by the top 0.1% households increased from 7% to 22% even as the wealth of the bottom 90% of households declined.the number of extremely wealthy people has also been climbing. according to research from spectrem group, in 2014, the number of us households with $1m or more in assets ð excluding the value of their primary home ð increased by 500,000 to 10.1m. in 2007, that number was 9.2m. households worth $5m or more reached 1.3m and 142,000 households are now worth $25m or more.since the 2008  nancial crisis, the income gap has expanded and the situation òhas gotten worse for the wealthyó, cockrell said. the main reason? not knowing if your friends are friends with you or your money.òsomeone else who is also a billionaire ð they donõt want anything from you. never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means, i think that is dif cult,ó said cockrell. òas the gap has widened, the rich have become more and more isolated.""these are real fears faced by the richest of the rich. in 2007, the gates foundation teamed up with boston collegeõs center on wealth and philanthropy to document what it felt like to be in americaõs 1%. for the next four years, researchers surveyed 165 of americaõs richest households ð 120 of those households have at least $25m in assets. the average net worth of those surveyed was $78m. the resulting study, the joys and dilemmas of wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old adage that money canõt buy happiness.òwealth can be a barrier to connecting with other people,ó confessed a spouse of a tech entrepreneur who made about $80m. some americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret. òwe talk about it as stealth wealth. there are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment,ó said traeger-muney. if wealthy americans talk about the unique challenges that come with their wealth, people often dismiss their experience.òpeople say ôoh, poor you.õ there is not a lot of sympathy there,ó she said. òwealth is still one of our last taboos.óspeaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to spill all your worries, cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money de ne them.òi donõt think itõs healthy to discount your problems. if you are part of the 1%, you still have problems and they are legitimate to you. even when you say, ôi donõt have to struggle for moneyõ, there are other parts of your life. money is not the only thing that de nes you,ó he said. òyour problems are legitimate.ó"
advanced	he had the tastes of a typical millionaire. he owned a gold and silver rolex and a fleet of expensive cars. he liked to dabble in modern art. but, although this chinese businessman had several companies and a palatial villa in the madrid suburbs, he had almost no money in the bank, a detail that piqued the interest of spanish authorities.gao ping, who had lived most of his adult life in spain, had a monopoly on supplies to 4,000 chinese bazaars across the mediterranean country. but, authorities suspected he was not paying taxes on the clothes, furniture and other goods he was importing from china.when police swooped on his warehouses in 2012 they found piles of cash: wads of €100, €200 and €500 notes were wrapped in elastic bands. around €12m was wheeled away in trolleys, the largest ever cash seizure by spanish police. the gang, with gao the alleged ringleader, stands accused of laundering up to €300m a year, as well as selling counterfeit goods and toys with fake safety marks. the government prosecutor said gao’s illegal business was so big it was damaging the competitiveness of spain. gao is on bail; the case has not yet come to trial.law enforcement officials have long had concerns about €500 notes. small and easy to transport relative to their value, they are the payment method of choice for tax dodgers, money launderers and drug barons. the sum of €1m in €500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag, where the same amount in €50 notes would require a small suitcase. cash mules have been known to fold the notes into plastic pellets and swallow them. a less dangerous method of concealment is to stuff the banknotes into a car chassis.the uk stopped distribution of the €500 note in 2010 on the grounds that demand for it was “almost entirely for criminal purposes”. in 2009, italy’s central bank warned that the notes were widely used by mafia money launderers and terrorists. other countries have limited their own highdenomination notes due to links to organized crime – canada scrapped its $1,000 note in 2000 on the advice of law enforcement officers.in an age of electronic payment systems and contactless cards, more are questioning whether printing these notes can be justified. peter sands, the former head of standard chartered bank, has called for the abolition of high-denomination notes, including the €500, the $100, the 1,000 swiss franc note and the £50. in a report for the harvard kennedy school of government, sands argued it was time to get rid of high-value notes that make life easier for “bad guys” pursuing tax evasion, financial crime, terrorist finance and corruption. although criminals would switch to smallerdenomination bills, or gold or diamonds, these substitutes are bulkier and more traceable, making it more likely they will get caught, he said.at a conference on terrorist financing in london, the head of europol, rob wainwright, called on the european central bank (ecb) to look at whether it “should continue to produce and circulate these notes that make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide their business and to fund illegal activities”. according to europol, the purple €500 note accounts for 30% of the value of all the euro notes in circulation, although most people have never seen one.the €500 note was introduced in 2002 when the euro was born: it replaced the 1,000 deutschmark, the 10,000 belgian franc and the 500,000 italian lira. several european countries favoured highvalue banknotes. “it is definitely a preference that has been there for a long time,” says pia hüttl, an affiliate fellow at the bruegel thinktank. “the preference is based on the idea that cash has a lower cost and is accepted everywhere.”cash remains king in germany and austria, where more than half of all transactions are made with paper money and coins. the former president of germany’s constitutional court, hans-jürgen papier, told germany’s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that restrictions on cash were at odds with individual freedom, while tabloid newspaper bild has launched a petition in defence of paper money, including the €500 note – “hands off my cash”.law enforcement authorities are less convinced, amid a steady stream of reports of suspicious bundles of cash. in one case that has caught the attention of police, two men walked into a bank and tried to deposit €200,000 of torn and muddy €500 notes. in the same week, €1.3m in €500 notes was found stuffed in the false bottom of suitcase. but, a suspicion of criminality is not enough to keep people in custody. “our frustration from a law enforcement perspective is that, in many jurisdictions, it is impossible to provide sufficient evidence to satisfy judicial authorities of a link between suspicious cash detections and criminality,” says jennifer macleod, a specialist in europol’s financial intelligence group. “the search for these links is complicated further through time constraints and fragmented cooperation and information exchange.”the agency would like to see central banks take more responsibility for the “striking anomalies” in the use of €500 notes. luxembourg, for example, issued more than twice its annual gdp in banknotes in 2013 alone, despite being one of the most cash-averse countries in europe. europol asked luxembourg’s central bank to explain. “the reply we had from luxembourg is that they simply issue the notes requested and have no explanation for the reasons behind the demand,” macleod says. “i find it surprising that a central bank does not consider itself to have a responsibility in this area.”this could be changing. mario draghi, the head of the ecb, has said he is determined that the income the bank generates from issuing the notes should not be “a comfort for criminals”. other members of the ecb’s top team, such as yves mersch, contend there is no evidence about the criminal uses of the €500 note. but, amid heightened fears about terrorism, this argument may no longer cut any ice. eu finance ministers have called on policymakers to explore “appropriate restrictions” on high-value notes and report back by 1 may 2016.
advanced	when it comes to climate change, we have the bad habit of focusing on the  rst part of the story, the part about the problem, and forgetting the second part about the many available solutions. these solutions are speeding up recycling, slowing down emissions and providing sustainable alternatives to plastic, air conditioning, smartphones and fast fashion.the intergovernmental panel on climate change recently gathered in copenhagen to present its latest report on the impacts and pace of climate change. climate change is now measured on all continents and our efforts to lower emissions must be intensi ed to avoid it escalating out of control. along with outlining the risks and challenges, copenhagen also embraced and focused on the solutions.in the spirit of focusing on what can be done, sustainia award, chaired by arnold schwarzenegger, celebrated ten leading sustainability solutions deployed in 84 countries. from food to fashion, energy to transportation, education to health, the awards showcased an alternative to the grim-future scenarios we are so often presented with and made sustainability tangible to the innovators, investors, consumers and policy makers across sectors and regions.from california, we saw how we can now produce plastics from greenhouse gases that are competitive with normal oil-based plastics in price and quality. from switzerland, we learned how we can recycle and reuse old clothes and shoes more effectively in a recycle system currently deployed in over 60 countries. and from canada, we learned how smartphones can make bike- sharing more convenient.the ten projects presented each offered unique solutions to sustainability challenges but it was the nigerian initiative, wecyclers, that won arnold schwarzeneggerõs, and the rest of juryõs, vote and took the sustainia award 2014.wecyclers enables low-income communities to make money on waste piling up in their streets. by deploying a  eet of cargo bicycles to collect and recycle unmanaged waste in lagos, wecyclers lets families exchange garbage for consumer goods via an sms-based point system.recycling companies purchase wecyclersõ sorted waste for reprocessing into products ð they turn it into mattresses, pillows and trash bags. wecyclers is a response to local waste issues, where itõs estimated that only 40% of the cityõs rubbish is collected. according to the world bank, only 46% of municipal solid waste in africa is collected. more than 5,000 households have signed up so far and there are plans to extend the initiative to other cities throughout nigeria.solutions to combat climate change are often perceived as hi-tech innovations focused on cutting emissions, creating infrastructure or ef ciency. however, to successfully solve the variety of challenges, we need variety in our solutions as well. sustainability is not solely a matter of bringing down emissions; it is also a question of using our natural resources more intelligently and creating healthier lives for ourselves. initiatives might be low-tech in innovation but high-impact when it comes to creating sustainable change for entire communities.with a wide range of solutions addressing the equally wide range of challenges, we must focus more on the important part of the story that creates enthusiasm and momentum, and spurs action for much-needed change.
advanced	the customer next to you in the queue looks innocent enough. but, instead of a shopping list, you notice sheõs carrying handwritten notes about the appearance and cleanliness of the store. sheõs been timing the progression of the queue on her phone ... and is that a tiny camera lens peeking out from her purse? the odds are youõve just spotted a mystery shopper.there are approximately 50,000 mystery shopping trips carried out every month in the uk, according to the mystery shopping providers association, and, as more and more spending takes place online, the demand for mystery shoppers is growing. òretailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who are prepared to set foot in a physical store want a service and an experience they canõt get online,ó says simon boydell, spokesman for marketforce, which has more than 300,000 mystery shoppers on its books. òour clients want to measure how well their stores are delivering on that experience.óòwe assign different store locations to each shopper and rotate them so that they never go back to the same shop within three months,ó says jill spencer of mystery shopping company aba. òeach day, they typically spend up to eight hours visiting  ve to ten stores, plus another hour or two  ling detailed reports on every aspect of their visit.ó for that, the mystery shoppers can earn up to £155 a day. they are also reimbursed for their petrol and hotel stays, and compensated for their car depreciation (the shoppers can be expected to drive as many as 20,000 miles a year). meanwhile, video mystery shoppers, who  lm their visits with a hidden camera planted in a buttonhole or handbag, can earn even more ð around £300 a day.shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy. òiõm typically given between £5 and £20 to spend at each store, to assess the service i receive at the till,ó says laura, a 50-year-old mystery shopper from devon, who has been paid to visit around 7,000 shops since 2001. the purchase usually has to be related to a service or a type of product that the retailer wants her to check. òiõm always given a scenario, such as buying something from a speci c department or a new product range, but, within that framework, i can often buy whatever i want ð and keep it.ólike most full-time mystery shoppers, laura is self-employed, taking jobs from aba and other mystery shopping companies as and when they come up. her income is typically £30,000 to £40,000 a year and that doesnõt include all the freebies she gets on the job. òwith the perks, itõs enough to live on. but i donõt do it because i love shopping. in fact, i hate shopping now. when iõm not working, it pains me to have to go out and buy a pint of milk.óshe does, however,  nd it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved. òi know it must be because of my feedback or why would they pay me to give it? some of the retailers i shop at win awards for customer service and i think that is down to us mystery shoppers. i feel iõm not just doing a service to my company; iõm doing a service to all shoppers everywhere.ósadly, regular mystery shopping assignments that pay like lauraõs are few and far between. in fact, competition is so  erce, she keeps her job a closely guarded secret and even her friends and family donõt know who she works for (laura is not her real name).itõs estimated that more than 500,000 people have registered as mystery shoppers in the uk, but just 10% or less manage to get regular work each month and this has led to a dramatic reduction in compensation. òwhere once you got a fee, reimbursement for your purchase and mileage, you now often just receive a contribution towards a purchase,ó say val, a 51-year-old former mystery shopper. òi worked for 40 different mystery shopping companies for almost 20 years but i gave up entirely three years ago because i had bills to pay and very few assignments paid what i considered to be an acceptable rate.ónowadays, mystery shopping companies mostly rely on the promise of freebies to incentivize their workers. òmarketforce shoppers typically get a couple of pounds for a visit as a token gesture for their time and effort,ó says boydell. òat the most, weõll pay £15 to £25 plus reimbursement for, say, a meal for two or a hotel stay. we donõt directly employ any shoppers so we donõt have to pay them the minimum wage.óòiõd go on a cruise for nothing,ó says laura. òbut i think mystery shopping companies that pay you a nominal fee to travel to a restaurant and eat a meal are exploiting people. i wonõt touch those jobs anymore.ó there are plenty of people, however, that would. hannah, a 41-year-old city lawyer, has conducted nearly 500 visits for the mystery dining company in her spare time without receiving remuneration or travel expenses. as a prestigious òplatinum dineró, she is regularly hand-picked by the mystery dining company to carry out their most exclusive assignments, enjoying £200 meals at michelin-starred mayfair restaurants,  ve-star hospitality at ascot and overnight stays at boutique hotels.but thereõs no such thing as a free lunch, even if you work for a mystery dining company. hannah says she typically spends two to four hours after each visit writing detailed reports on everything from the quality of the food to speci c interactions with staff, whom she always needs to be able to name or òsubtlyó describe. trickiest of all, she must memorize all these details while eating her meal ð unable, of course, to openly write anything down.òthereõs lots to remember and sometimes it can detract from the experience. youõre expected to give feedback while itõs fresh, so iõve had to get up at 5am to write a report before work. itõs a challenging thing to do; you need to be focused, articulate and detail orientated.ó
advanced	they may not know who steve jobs was or even how to tie their own shoelaces, but the average six-year-old child understands more about digital technology than a 45-year-old adult, according to an authoritative new report.the advent of broadband in the year 2000 has created a generation of digital natives, ofcom (which checks standards in the uk communications industries) says in its annual study of british consumers. born in the new millennium, these children have never known the dark ages of dial-up internet and the youngest are learning how to operate smartphones or tablets before they are able to talk.òthese younger people are shaping communications,ó said jane rumble, ofcomõs media research head. òas a result of growing up in the digital age, they are developing fundamentally different communication habits from older generations, even compared to what we call the early adopters, the 16-to-24 age group.óofcom devised a òdigital quotientó, or dq, test to put 800 children and 2,000 adults through their paces, which, rather than measuring intelligence, as an iq test would, attempts to gauge awareness of and self-con dence around gadgets from tablets to smart watches, knowledge of superfast internet, 4g mobile- phone networks and mobile apps.among 6- to 7-year-olds, who have grown up with youtube, spotify music streaming and online television, the average dq score was 98, higher than for those aged between 45 and 49, who scored an average of 96. digital understanding peaks between 14 and 15 years of age, when the average is a dq of 113, and then drops gradually throughout adulthood, before falling rapidly in old age.people are now being invited to test their digital knowledge with an abbreviated version of the questionnaire that will give any member of the public a dq score, along with advice on how to improve their understanding and protect themselves and their families online.the ways in which millennial children contact each other and consume entertainment are so different from previous generations that forecasters now consider their preferences a better indication of the future than those of trendsetting young adults.the most remarkable change is in time spent talking on the phone. two decades ago, teenagers devoted their evenings to monopolizing the home telephone line, dissecting love affairs and friendships in conversations that lasted for hours.for those aged 12 to 15, phone calls account for just 3% of time spent communicating through any device. for all adults, this rises to 20% and, for young adults, it is still three times as high at 9%. todayõs children do the majority of their remote socializing by sending written messages or through shared photographs and videos. òthe millennium generation is losing its voice,ó ofcom claims.over 90% of their device-time is message based, chatting on social networks like facebook, sending instant messages through services like whatsapp or even  ring off traditional mobile- phone text messages. just 2% of childrenõs time is spent emailing, compared to 33% for adults.away from their phones, 12- to 15-year-olds have a very different relationship with other media, too. a digital seven-day diary shows live television accounts for just half of viewing for this age group, compared to nearly 70% for all adults. they spend 20% of their time viewing short video clips, for example on youtube, or news clips distributed via facebook and other social sites. the rest of their viewing is shared between dvds, streamed content through net ix or itunes and recorded television programmes.young adults aged 16 to 24 are voracious consumers of almost all media. however, live radio and print-based media have all but disappeared from their daily diet.younger people are moving away from live television and moving to streaming and catch- up services. even among adults, television is becoming less important. television viewing among 16- to 24-year-olds has been dipping each year since 2010, but 2013 was the  rst year where researchers found viewing fell across all age groups. the theory is that tablet computers ð among the most popular christmas presents in 2012 and 2013 ð have brought many older people online for longer. with large screens and simple, touch-based interfaces, tablets are being credited with a jump in internet access among the over-65s.òfor years, there has been a very stubborn resistance by the over-65s to accessing the internet,ó said james thickett, research director at ofcom. òin the last three years, we have seen that change and we think thatõs down to tablets.ó britain is embracing internet-enabled devices across the generations, to the extent that the balance between sleep and screen-based activities has now tipped. the typical adult spends eight hours and 41 minutes each day communicating or consuming media, including old-fashioned books and newspapers, and just eight hours and 21 minutes asleep.
advanced	the international monetary fund (imf) has appealed to washington to sort out its finances after the us pulled back from the brink of a debt default and hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work after a 16-day government shutdown.as the us president, barack obama, warned “we’ve got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis,” the imf’s managing director, christine lagarde, appealed for more stability.“it will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner,” she said.“we also continue to encourage the us to approve a budget for 2014 and replace the sequester with gradually phased-in measures that would not harm the recovery, and to adopt a balanced and comprehensive medium-term fiscal plan.”a senate-drafted peace deal that contained almost no concessions to the conservatives who had driven the country to the precipice of a new financial crisis was passed by the republican-dominated house of representatives just hours before a deadline to extend the us debt limit was to pass.the world bank, too, expressed its relief that the global economy had “dodged a potential catastrophe”, with its president, jim yong kim, urging policymakers in all countries to “continue to focus on crafting and implementing policies that promote economic growth and boost jobs and opportunity for all”.stock markets in japan, china, hong kong and south korea initially reflected relief after the republicans finally capitulated in their failed attempt to undermine obama’s healthcare reforms. but, in asia and europe, stock markets overall displayed a muted reaction, with traders apparently expecting another battle in washington early in 2014.the shutdown is estimated to have cost the us $24bn, according to the ratings agency standard & poor’s. china’s official xinhua news agency had accused washington of jeopardizing other countries’ dollar assets. china is the us government’s largest creditor.obama signed the necessary legislation to fend off a default shortly after midnight on thursday after a republican split in the house of representatives. the bill had passed easily with broad bipartisan support in the senate, where democratic and republican leaders forged the agreement. it offers a temporary fix, funding the government until 15 january and raising the debt ceiling until 7 february.but the president made clear he did not expect another bitter budget fight and shutdown in 2014.in brief remarks at the white house shortly before the house vote, obama said he hoped the deal would “lift the cloud of uncertainty” that had hung over the country in recent weeks.“once this agreement arrives on my desk, i will sign it immediately,” he said, in a statement delivered at the white house. “hopefully, next time it won’t be in the eleventh hour. we’ve got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis.”as he left the lectern after his wednesday night press briefing, the president was asked by a journalist whether the crisis would happen all over again in a few months. speaking over his shoulder, obama replied, “no.”earlier, the republican senator mike lee had struck a defiant tone, perhaps indicating more trouble ahead: “the media keeps asking: ‘was it worth it?’ my answer is, it is always worth it to do the right thing.” he added: “this is not over.”however, the political deal was one of the worst of all possible outcomes for republicans. none of their stated goals was achieved and polls showed that voters overwhelmingly blamed them for the crisis.
advanced	scientists have connected the brains of a pair of animals and allowed them to share sensory information in a major step towards what the researchers call the world’s first “organic computer”.the us team fitted two rats with devices called brain-to-brain interfaces that let the animals collaborate on simple tasks to earn rewards, such as a drink of water. in one radical demonstration of the technology, the scientists used the internet to link the brains of two rats separated by thousands of miles, with one in the researchers’ lab at duke university in durham, north carolina, and the other in natal, brazil.led by miguel nicolelis, a pioneer of devices that allow paralyzed people to control computers and robotic arms with their thoughts, the researchers say their latest work may enable multiple brains to be hooked up to share information. “these experiments showed that we have established a sophisticated, direct communication linkage between brains,” nicolelis said in a statement. “basically, we are creating what i call an organic computer.”the scientists first demonstrated that rats can share, and act on, each other’s sensory information by electrically connecting their brains via tiny grids of electrodes that reach into the motor cortex, the brain region that processes movement.the rats were trained to press a lever when a light went on above it. when they performed the task correctly, they got a drink of water. to test the animals’ ability to share brain information, they put the rats in two separate compartments. only one compartment had a light that came on above the lever. when the rat pressed the lever, an electronic version of its brain activity was sent directly to the other rat’s brain. in trials, the second rat responded correctly to the imported brain signals 70% of the time by pressing the lever.remarkably, the communication between the rats the rats collaborated on a task that required them to distinguish between narrow and wide openings using their whiskers. was two-way. if the receiving rat failed at the task, the first rat was not rewarded with a drink, and appeared to change its behaviour to make the task easier for its partner. in further experiments,in the final test, the scientists connected rats on different continents and beamed their brain activity back and forth over the internet. “even though the animals were on different continents, with the resulting noisy transmission and signal delays, they could still communicate,” said miguel pais-vieira, the first author of the study. “this tells us that we could create a workable network of animal brains distributed in many different locations.”nicolelis said the team is now working on ways to link several animals’ brains at once to solve more complex tasks. “we cannot even predict what kinds of emergent properties would appear when animals begin interacting as part of a ‘brain-net’,” he said. “in theory, you could imagine that a combination of brains could provide solutions that individual brains cannot achieve by themselves.” the research is published in the journal scientific reports.anders sandberg, who studies the ethics of neurotechnologies at the future of humanity institute at oxford university, said the work was “very important” in helping to understand how brains encode information. but the implications of the technology and its potential future uses are far broader, said sandberg. “the main reason we are running the planet is that we are amazingly good at communicating and coordinating. without that, although we are very smart animals, we would not dominate the planet.”“i don’t think there’s any risk of supersmart rats from this,” he added. “there’s a big difference between sharing sensory information and being able to plan. i’m not worried about an imminent invasion of ‘rat multiborgs’.”very little is known about how thoughts are encoded and how they might be transmitted into another person’s brain, so that is not a realistic prospect any time soon. and much of what is in our minds is what sandberg calls a “draft” of what we might do. “often, we don’t want to reveal those drafts; that would be embarrassing and confusing. and a lot of those drafts are changed before we act. most of the time i think we’d be very thankful not to be in someone else’s head.”
advanced	they call him the robin hood of the banks, a man who took out dozens of loans, worth almost half a million euros, with no intention of ever paying them back. instead, enric duran handed the money out to projects that created and promoted alternatives to capitalism.after 14 months in hiding, duran is unapologetic, even though his activities could land him in jail. òiõm proud of what i did,ó he said in an interview by skype from an undisclosed location. the money, he said, had created opportunities. òit generated a movement that allowed us to push forward with the construction of alternatives. and it allowed us to build a powerful network that groups together these initiatives.ófrom 2006 to 2008, duran took out 68 commercial and personal loans from 39 banks in spain. he farmed the money out to social activists, funding speaking tours against capitalism and tv cameras for a media network. òi saw that, on one side, these social movements were building alternatives but that they lacked resources and communication capacities,ó he said. òmeanwhile, our reliance on perpetual growth was creating a system that created money out of nothing.óthe loans he swindled from banks were his way of regulating and denouncing this situation, he said. he started slowly. òi  lled out a few credit applications with my real details. they denied me, but i just wanted to get a feel for what they were asking for.ófrom there, the former table-tennis coach began to weave an intricate web of accounts, payments and transfers. òi was learning constantly.ó by the summer of 2007, he had discovered how to make the system work, applying for loans under the name of a false television production company. òthen, i managed to get a lot.ó û492,000, to be exact.duran was arrested in spain in 2009, on charges brought against him by six of the 39 banks that had lent him money. he spent two months in prison before being bailed for û50,000. in february 2013, facing up to eight years in prison, he decided to  ee rather than stand trial. òi donõt see legitimacy in a judicial system based on authority, because i donõt recognize its authority,ó he said.his actions, he said, were in the vanguard of a worldwide debate on the economic crisis. the timing pushed the anti-capitalist movement into the light, just as many spaniards were seeking alternatives to a system that had wreaked havoc on their lives.while the same actions would probably be better understood in todayõs spain, he said that they would not be needed. the anti-capitalist movement has grown from a fringe movement to one supported by thousands of spaniards, he said, evidenced by the widely supported movements such as the indignados.success has helped the movement become self- suf cient. òwe now have the capacity to generate resources,ó said duran, adding somewhat ironically that this was exactly what banks issue credit for ð òto advance and generate a situation that allows you to be independentó. duran is widening his focus to include spainõs justice system, by promoting restorative justice. òthe people in spain who believe that banks donõt work, they think that i donõt owe anything. iõve already done my work,ó he said. òbut there is a part of a population that is not in agreement with us and i think i should respond to that.óin his case, he said, the element of reciprocity he could offer to banks might lie in the insight he gleaned from years of obtaining bank loans fraudulently. he could share his thoughts on òwhich best practices work and the bad ones that donõt,ó he suggested, òfor the general population and for bank workersó.
advanced	up to a billion people will remain in extreme poverty by 2030 unless countries focus on inequalities and confront social, economic and cultural forces that block their escape or pull them back into impoverishment, a major report warns. the report by the chronic poverty advisory network (cpan) asserts that many people may rise above the poverty line of $1.25 a day, only to tumble back when they are hit by a combination or sequence of shocks such as drought, illness and insecurity or con ict.drawing on household panel surveys, the report found that, in parts of rural kenya and in south africa, 30 to 40% of those who escaped from poverty fell back, rising to 60% in some areas of ethiopia between 1999 and 2009. even in successful countries such as indonesia and vietnam, the proportion has been 20%.individual cases highlight the ease with which people can slip back into poverty. amin, 61, from rural bangladesh, has seen his livelihood gradually decline, due to his own and his wifeõs illnesses, the cost of his sonõs marriage, the death of his father and loss of goods such as  shing nets. lovemore, 74, from zimbabwe, has become one of the poorest people in his village. he recently lost his job as a car-park attendant due to ill health and had to take in his  ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters.òwe need to ensure that people lifted out of poverty remain above the poverty line permanently. too many families are experiencing ôtwo steps forward, one step backõ, where they struggle to recover from personal or bigger setbacks. governments shouldnõt assume that, just because somebodyõs income hits $1.25, that means job done,ó said andrew shepherd, research fellow at the overseas development institute, a partner of cpan, and lead author of the report.a un high-level panel considering a new development framework to succeed the millennium development goals after 2015 said the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 was within reach. the report, however, argues that òmore of the sameó will not get to zero.despite a drop in extreme poverty from 1.9bn in 1990 to 1.2bn in 2010, the report says that progress in the next 15 years will be much harder. the big gains in china are unlikely to be matched by similar progress elsewhere, while climate-related shocks and deep poverty in parts of sub-saharan africa will slow momentum.the report calls for a shift in thinking about poverty to focus on the chronically poor ð those who are poor for many years or their entire lives ð and for more emphasis on stopping impoverishment, the descent into poverty. ògovernments have been quite good at moving people over the poverty line because that is relatively easy ð there is a tendency to pick the low-hanging fruit, but they have shied away from the more dif cult job of tackling chronic poverty,ó said shepherd.the report says progress on poverty reduction, while impressive to date, has had less of an impact on the chronically poor than on those who were already closer to the poverty line. it will not be possible to get to zero unless development policies prioritize those living in chronic poverty, it adds. policymakers must aim for a òzero tripodó of separate but interdependent objectives: tackle chronic poverty; stop impoverishment; sustain poverty escapes. they put forward a trio of policies, all of which require massive global investment.the  rst is social assistance ð a safety net ð to bring the poorest people closer to a decent standard of living. an example of such a scheme is ethiopiaõs productive safety net programme that allowed thousands of vulnerable households to withstand drought without having to curtail education spending. the second is education, from early childhood to the start of work, to enable people to escape and stay out of poverty. education also has the advantage of being a òportableó asset. the third is pro-poorest economic growth policies to ensure that the bene ts of increasing national prosperity reach the very poorest people.òeconomic growth really is critical, but not just any old growth,ó shepherd said. òit has to generate not just employment but decent jobs, not just insecure low-paying jobs. there are ways of doing this, like indiaõs rural employment guarantees scheme, which has boosted urban not just rural wages.ó another example cited by the report is south africaõs extension of the minimum wage to groups such as domestic workers.all this will take money and the report says one obvious implication is that stronger domestic tax systems and greater tax revenues will be required. aid will also be needed for the start-up costs for social assistance, universal health coverage and to  nance education, including scholarships for the poorest children. òthere remains a huge role for aid in the next 20 years, as many developing countries spend less than $500 on each of their citizens a year. even nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per capita,ó shepherd said.against a backdrop of crises in syria, south sudan and the central african republic, con ict and environmental disasters have to be addressed, and the report says it is essential that governments work to reduce the risk of con ict and to establish inclusive peace settlements.incorporating òreducing (income) inequalityó as a post-2015 goal would steer the international agenda in the right direction, given that lessening or containing inequality speeds up the impact of economic growth on poverty reduction. the report argues that if the inequalities that affect the poorest people ð such as access to land, labour markets and the power relationships between men and women ð are addressed, this would tackle two goals at the same time: reducing chronic poverty and inequality.the authors urge governments to develop an inclusive national development plan and to work with civil society to ensure the poorest people are represented politically as well as tackling dif cult social norms such as dowries and witchcraft that contribute to extreme poverty: òthis often means challenging and, perhaps, sweeping away aspects of the status quo and represents the most marked departure from ôbusiness as usualõ.ó
advanced	not nearly enough exercise classes have a tea break halfway through. but margaret allen’s does. after a gentle warm-up and a few pulse-raising numbers, the 93-year-old great-grandmother lets her charges rehydrate with a cup of tea and a quick sit down.some of the eight-strong class look as if they need it more than others. allen herself, wearing a thick turquoise shirt, navy knitted waistcoat, black slacks and sensible shoes, has not broken into a sweat. despite an “excruciating” trapped nerve in one leg and a knee in need of replacement, she looks as though she could go on for hours.the general rule is that eating directly before sport is not the best idea, let alone part way through. but, on the afternoon i visit allen’s class at a church hall in saltburn-by-the-sea near middlesbrough, slices of fruitcake are being passed around during the break. the cake has been baked in honour of allen’s recent birthday by her 89-year-old sister, joan, known locally as the “scone queen of saltburn”.the ladies have barely swallowed their last crumb when allen is up again, leading the group through a jaunty scottish number involving lots of toe pointing and leg kicking. forty-five minutes later, the class is finally over.allen, a former volunteer with the red cross, has been leading classes in the north-east seaside town for 45 years. not particularly sporty at school, she started playing the piano for a keep-fit class during the second world war – “just for something to do during the blackouts, really” – and eventually took over in her 40s when the previous instructor retired.at its peak, allen’s class had more than 18 regulars, each paying £1 a time. but, these days, her flock is diminishing fast – during the teabreak, the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them had attended that week for one of the younger members of the group who had just died, aged 68, from motor neurone disease.allen is the oldest, followed by her sister. the baby of the group is 60-year-old jean cunion, who credits the group with supporting her through a difficult time when her mother died. she is somewhat embarrassed to admit that she is perhaps the least fit of the group. “i remember, the first time i came, margaret said: ‘who’s that huffing and panting?’ and i had to admit it was me.” ruth steere, 76, marvels at how allen never misses a trick, despite always having her back to the class: “she always shouts at us if we go wrong. she’s remarkably good at knowing what we are doing.”allen, a keen dancer, has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor. instead, she choreographs her own moves based on five tapes from the bbc’s first ever fitness guru, eileen fowler, who died in 2000 when she was 93, allen’s age now. allen thinks her good health is largely down to keeping busy, especially since her husband joe died in 1997. she took up writing poetry when she was 80.“i write poems about everything. i’m a prolific writer. i just can’t stop,” she says, phoning me a few days after the interview to read out a ditty she has written about the joys of exercise. one of the class, 84-year-old former teacher winnie robertson, thinks the secret to staying fit is never letting yourself go: “use it or lose it, that’s what i say.”allen still plays the piano and gives speeches. she is president of the women’s fellowship at the local methodist church and is one of three 90-plus year olds at the scrabble club of the university of the third age. she did a computer course when she was 88 and tried to get online, but it didn’t work out.ageing is no fun, she admits, reading me a few lines from a poem she has written called ‘that beast called age’. she happily recalls a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years back, who said she couldn’t possibly be more than 78: “i said, ‘thank you, doctor. you can go now.’”she also has a no-nonsense attitude to weight gain: “i just think people shouldn’t eat too much. whenever i hear someone saying, ‘oh, i can’t lose weight’, i say: ‘sellotape.’” she mimes taping her mouth shut. “i said this just the other day to a big fat man. everything in moderation is my motto.”earlier in 2013, allen was watching the news and saw a woman being given the british empire medal. i think she means margaret chartwood from horley, who was given the honour in january, at the age of 77. “she was saying: ‘i’m 80 and i’m the oldest fitness instructor in the country!’ i was thinking: ‘no, you’re not.’ but i shan’t be writing to buckingham palace.”
