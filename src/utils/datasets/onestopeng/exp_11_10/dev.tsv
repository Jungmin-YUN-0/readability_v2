intermediate	water scientists have given one of the strongest warnings ever about global food supplies. they say that the world’s population may have to change almost completely to a vegetarian diet by 2050 to avoid catastrophic shortages.humans get about 20% of their protein from animal-based products now. however, this may need to decrease to just 5% to feed the extra two billion people expected to be alive by 2050, according to research by some of the world’s top water scientists.“there will not be enough water to produce food for the expected nine-billion population in 2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards diets common in western nations,” the report by malik falkenmark and colleagues at the stockholm international water institute (siwi) said.“there will be just enough water if the proportion of animal-based foods is limited to 5% of total calories.”warnings that water scarcity could limit food production come at the same time as oxfam and the un prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years. prices for items such as corn and wheat have risen nearly 50% on international markets since june. the price increase has been caused by severe droughts in the us and russia, and weak monsoon rains in asia. more than 18 million people are already facing serious food shortages across the sahel.oxfam says that the price increase will have a devastating effect in developing countries that rely heavily on food imports, including parts of latin america, north africa and the middle east. food shortages in 2008 led to fighting and riots in 28 countries.changing to a vegetarian diet is one way to increase the amount of water available to grow more food in a world where the climate is becoming increasingly erratic, the scientists said. animal protein-rich food uses five to ten times more water than a vegetarian diet. one third of the world’s arable land is used to grow crops to feed animals. other options to feed people include stopping waste and increasing trade between countries that have a food surplus and countries that don’t have enough food.“nine hundred million people already go hungry and two billion people are malnourished although per-capita food production continues to increase,” they said. “seventy per cent of all water is used in agriculture, and growing more food to feed an extra two billion people by 2050 will place greater pressure on water and land.”the report is being released at the start of the annual world water conference in stockholm, sweden, where 2,500 politicians, un groups, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries meet to discuss global water supply problems.competition for water between food production and other uses will increase pressure on essential resources, the scientists said. “the un predicts that we must increase food production by 70% by mid-century. this will put additional pressure on our water resources, which are already stressed, at a time when we also need more water to satisfy global energy demand and to create electricity for the 1.3 billion people who are without it,” said the report.overeating, malnourishment and waste are all increasing. “we will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future,” said the report’s editor, anders jägerskog.nannannannan
intermediate	emmanuel limal used online dating sites a lot but he was tired of meeting women who weren’t ready to start a family, or at least wouldn’t admit that they were. the 43-yearold actor, originally from france, had spent 20 years living in copenhagen and looking for love in the hope of raising children. he tried to find someone online but was dismayed by the results.“i got frustrated with everyone saying they were really active, always travelling or with a long list of hobbies, but no mention of children,” limal said. “on some sites, there was an option to click saying: ‘i’d like kids someday,’ but you would read the person’s profile and think: ‘you will never have time!’ if someone’s going to the gym eight times a week and travelling every month, they are not putting a family first.”limal has a six-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, but coming from a big family – his father is one of 11 – he has always wanted more children. “i couldn’t seem to meet anyone willing to prioritize starting a family”. he said it was difficult to know when to mention wanting kids when he met someone new. “it’s the ultimate dating taboo,” he said. “then one day i read a profile from a 38-year-old who said she knew it was ‘really bad to admit’ but she wanted children. and i just thought: ‘you shouldn’t be ashamed of this.’”limal borrowed money to pay for the setting up of babyklar.nu – or ‘baby-ready now’ in english. it works like a normal dating site but everyone is asked to be honest about their wish to start a family soon. “we ask people if they are ok with someone who already has children and if they want another baby,” limal said. “but we don’t make them say how many children they’d like. that would be a bit too much like grocery shopping online.”he has had a very positive response to the site. “we had 50 sign-ups an hour when we started in june and we are already hearing from couples who have met through the site and are now together. i’m fully expecting the first babyklar.nu baby by next summer.” more men have signed up than women (53% to 47%), with comments such as “it’s so lovely to be able to say this out loud” and “i finally dare to be honest about what i want.”the site has come at the right time for the country of five million people. danes are not having enough babies, according to a report from the copenhagen hospital rigshospitalet, and the current rate of 1.7 children per family is not enough to maintain denmark’s population. the usual reasons are given – women are leaving it “too late” and couples are living together without getting married and waiting to start families.“now, i hope, men and women who want to start a family but haven’t met the right person yet will have another option,” says limal. he says that this isn’t just about baby farming: “i want this to be about children and love. my goal is to pair up people who really want a family and a partner – and who’ll stay together. i’m a romantic at heart.”there are plans to launch the site in france and the uk later in 2013, but for now it is the danes who are benefitting from it. “danes have no problem having children before marriage so things can move fast and, because the country’s so small, a jutlander can date a copenhagener without too much travel,” limal said. what’s more, limal has finally found love. “i’ve met a nice woman and she wants a baby too – so we shall see.”
intermediate	flappy bird be careful what you wish for, especially if you want to invent something new. recently, dong nguyen, the designer of the mobile game flappy bird, removed it from app stores. he said its success – it had been downloaded more than 50 million times and was making him around £30,000 from advertising each day – had ruined his simple life. on his twitter account, he said: “i cannot take this anymore.” ok, so regretting making flappy bird isn’t quite the same as regretting making a rifl e, but nguyen is just the latest inventor who wished he hadn’t created a monster.the labradoodle the labradoodle isn’t a monster – it’s adorable. but what’s monstrous is the way crossbreed dogs have been sold since the labradoodle’s inventor, wally conron, fi rst created the breed in the 1980s. “i’ve done a lot of damage,” he told the associated press. “i’ve created a lot of problems. there are a lot of unhealthy and abandoned dogs out there.” conron came up with the labradoodle when he was working for the royal guide dog association of australia to provide a dog for a blind woman whose husband was allergic to dog hair. what he didn’t expect was that the labradoodle – and other types of poodle-cross dogs, many of which have health problems – would become so popular.the ak-47 six months before his death in december 2013, mikhail kalashnikov, the designer of the assault rifl e, wrote to the head of the russian orthodox church: “my spiritual torment is unbearable. if my rifl e killed people, does that mean that i, mikhail kalashnikov, 93 years of age, the son of a poor farmer, christian and orthodox by faith, am responsible for people’s deaths, even if they were enemies?”electronic tagging the electronic tag was originally made in the 1960s as a way of tracking former prisoners’ attendance at school and work, and rewarding them for good behaviour. its inventors, bob gable and his brother kirkland, were later horrifi ed that the tag had become a form of control and punishment. “it’s not pleasant,” kirkland gable told the guardian in 2010, “but i’m not in control of the universe. i have to realize there are some things out of my control.”pepper spray after police sprayed peaceful protesters with pepper spray at a university of california campus in 2011, one of the scientists who helped develop it in the 80s denounced its use. “i have never seen such an inappropriate use of chemicals,” kamran loghman told the new york times.the offi ce cubicle in the late 60s, a new form of offi ce was designed to give workers privacy and increase productivity by providing more work space. instead, it became a way for companies to put employees into tighter spaces. these days, the cubicle is often connected with uniformity and soulless work. its inventor, bob propst, said, in 1997, “the use of cubicles in modern corporations is crazy.”
intermediate	a subway system has billions of inhabitants: the bacteria of swiss cheese and kimchi, bubonic plague and drug-proof bugs and human skin. now, for the  rst time, scientists have started to catalogue and map the bacteria in a cityõs subway ð and they have found many interesting results.dr christopher mason, a geneticist at weill cornell medical college, led a team that, for 18 months, tested the new york city subway system for the microscopic life forms that cover its turnstiles, seats, ticket booths and stations. his team found meningitis at times square, a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown manhattan.the team have strongly downplayed the  ndings of plague and anthrax. they say that there is only an extremely small trace of the latter, that rats likely carried the former and that no one has fallen ill with plague in or around new york for years.òthe results do not suggest that plague or anthrax is prevalent,ó the study says. ònor do they suggest that new york residents are at risk.óin fact, most of the bacteria identi ed by the team are either harmless to humans or bene cial in the cityõs thriving world of microorganisms.some of the results were expected and òshould be a gentle reminder for people to wash their handsó, mason said. he also said that they found many bacteria of the same sort as those òthat are bene cial and helpful, like the one used for making cheese.óbacteria appeared to re ect the eating habits of various neighbourhoods. all around the subway, bacteria associated with cheeses ð brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella found on new york pizza ð appeared. the distinctive bacteria of swiss cheese were more limited to midtown manhattan and the  nancial district, and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the  nancial district and bay ridge.bacteria associated with illness and infections were extremely common. species that cause diarrhoea and nausea, as well as e.coli, and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city. the species that produces tetanus appeared in soho and bacteria that cause dysentery appeared at a station in the bronx and another in harlem.mason and his team collected more than 1,000 samples at all of new yorkõs 466 open subway stations. they put the organic materials through a dna sequencer and, then, through a supercomputer. they identi ed 15,152 distinct species, nearly half of which were bacteria.the good news, the researchers said, is that these òpotentially infectious bacteriaó are not spreading sickness or disease throughout new york. they seem to be ònormal co-habitants of a cityó.in short, the researchers conclude, the subway and city are about as safe as everyone thought.mason said people should not be concerned about getting urinary-tract infections from subway seats. òyou should wash your hands,ó he said, òand probably get some sleep, eat salads and go to the gym, and thatõs about the same today as it was yesterday.óòin fact,ó he added, òiõve become much more con dent riding the subway.ómany  findings made sense: stations like grand central and times square, where there are more people, had more bacteria and more diversity among them. the bronx, with its diverse neighbourhoods and stations, had the greatest diversity of bacteria; staten island, with just three stops, had the lowest.the researchers found marine bacteria at south ferry, a station that  ooded during hurricane sandy ð but they were surprised to note the species included some normally associated with antarctica and  fish.the next steps, mason said, are studies of other cities, which have begun in paris, sa_o paolo and shanghai, and continued studies of new york, for instance to see how the results change with the seasons. he said he hoped the research would provide òa baselineó of research for health of cials and geneticists, and could help health of cials to prevent and track diseases and pathogens.
intermediate	on one day in august, one in seven people on earth, 1 billion people, used facebook, according to founder mark zuckerberg. in ten years, the social network has completely changed peopleõs relationships, privacy, their businesses, news media, helped to end regimes and even changed the meanings of common words.òa more open and connected world is a better world. it brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society,ó wrote zuckerberg.these are just some of the ways his company changed everything ð for better or worse.1 facebook has changed the de nition of òfriendó òto friendó is now a verb. and, unlike in real life, it is easy to òunfriendó someone, a word invented to describe ending a facebook friendship when that person is no longer improving your facebook newsfeed.although the meanings of the words òshareó and òlikeó are basically the same, facebook has made the terms more important to us.school and university reunions are unnecessary ð you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and youõve seen pictures of your schoolmatesõ babies. you wonõt be surprised to see an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyõre dating someone else from the romantic sel es.but, unlike in real life, on facebook, all your friends have the same importance. a classmate from university who you havenõt seen for 15 years, a friend-of-a-friend from a party or a colleague youõve never actually spoken to in person ð they are all facebook friends in the same way as your closest friend or your spouse or your mum.it doesnõt necessarily mean we see them the same way. professor robin dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have about 150 people as a social group. facebook hasnõt changed that yet, he believes. but dunbar says he fears it is so easy simply to end friendships on facebook that, eventually, people may not need to learn to get on with each other.2 we care less about privacy the surprising thing is that facebook users happily hand over their information.pew research center found that most young people are more than willing to hand over their details. ninety- one per cent post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.but, because so much of a personõs life is shared online, facebook gives people a way to create an image and a fanbase. academics have described a new phenomenon: the òfacebook selfó.more than 80% of facebook users list their interests, which allows brands to target them effectively. but most younger users limit who can see their pro les, with 60% allowing friends only.3 facebook has created millions of jobs ð but not in its own of ces facebook provides indirect employment for people whose job it is to make facebook work for their brand.òit is a tool like no other,ó said michael tinmouth, a social media strategist who has worked with brands such as vodafone and microsoft. òmarketers have an understanding of a brandõs customers like they have never had before. the data available is extraordinary. you know who your customers are, who they are friends with and how they engage with your brand.óand advertisers pay a lot for that. facebook reported advertising revenue had increased by 46%, reaching $3.32bn.facebook is also a mine eld for brands. suddenly, customers donõt simply complain on the phone to a customer service representative or on a small specialist internet forum ð angry customers can post their complaints for hundreds of their friends to see or even on the brandõs own page.4 facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by facebook. manchester universityõs olga onuch found facebook had been the key way for reaching half of all the euromaidan protesters in ukraine. many of the people interviewed in onuchõs research said they relied on facebook for the truth about what was happening ð they donõt trust traditional media.5 facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news about 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63% of users overall, according to the pew research center. about a third of facebook users post about politics and government.most people will  rst read an item of breaking news via facebook or other social media, mostly on mobiles.facebook has also changed the ways journalists write stories. it is a resource many reporters cannot now live without. for better or (often) worse, it is a place to  nd information on almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly  nd themselves at the centre of the dayõs biggest news story.6 users are changing facebook it used to be a site for students of top us universities.in 2014, ten years after its launch, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a facebook account. and 39% are connected to people they have never met in person.more than ever, the site is a gateway not just to your friends but to the rest of the internet.we may as well get used to it, said david kirkpatrick, author of the facebook effect. òit might very well go away further down the road but something this big takes a long time to disappear,ó he told bbc radio 4õs today programme. òfacebook has proven its ability to change and it will continue to be a very, very major player.ónannan
intermediate	james bond films are one of the world’s longest running and most successful film series, with 23 movies and more than $6bn earned at box offices around the world. but james bond shows no signs of slowing down. in fact, bond is more popular than ever, after the record-breaking performance of skyfall, which became the biggest ever film at the uk box office in 2012, earning a total of $1.1bn.for this reason, there was a lot of interest surrounding the announcement of a few more details about the 24th bond film – especially its official title, spectre. the number one question is: can spectre repeat skyfall’s success?charles gant, film editor for heat magazine, says it is heading in the right direction. “skyfall was a brilliant strategic move,” he says. “it was simultaneously modern and retro. it appealed to fans of daniel craig and it also engaged the older, more nostalgic bond fans, who may have lost interest over the previous few films. with the new title,” he adds, “it is certain to be a success.”it seems that eon productions, the company originally founded in 1961 to make dr no and that is behind all the “official” bonds, is doing all it can to ensure another success – they are installing the key creative talent behind skyfall on spectre. daniel craig will play bond at least until film 25 and the same writers have produced the script.but it’s getting sam mendes as director again that gives bond fans the most hope. a director mainly known for character studies such as american beauty and revolutionary road, mendes has taken the bond series to new heights. gant says: “mendes managed to engage with both the modern and the traditional bond audience, and he also attracted top actors like ralph fiennes. actors like fiennes will only agree to be in a film if they like the director.”though the bond series was not in trouble before mendes’s arrival – and craig’s – there was a certain amount of staleness towards the end of pierce brosnan’s time as bond. the series had survived the drying up of original bond stories to adapt, and the movies were no longer anything like the ian fleming originals, but they were lacking dynamism.this cycle, however, was nothing new: the history of the bond series has been one of ebb and flow, revolving most obviously around the lead actor: first, sean connery; then, successively, george lazenby, roger moore, timothy dalton, brosnan and, now, craig. each new bond has been a response to the state of the series, and some have been more successful than others.lazenby only lasted a single film and dalton’s two efforts, the living daylights and licence to kill, were during a period in the late 80s when the 007 movie was eclipsed by more aggressive, slick hollywood action movies. according to gant, “the period of roger moore’s last films, and the dalton period, didn’t really excite audiences. brosnan was more successful commercially, but craig has taken bond to new levels. on the other hand, the early bonds were incredibly commercial films, sexy and exciting, and there was very little like them.”skyfall made more money than all the other bond films. however, the performance of some of the 1960s films was almost as brilliant by comparison. if you adjust the figures for inflation, the 1965 release, thunderball, is only just below skyfall, while goldfinger and you only live twice both did better than the other craig films (and the 70s bonds, the spy who loved me and live and let die, did better, too). by this calculation, licence to kill is the worst-performing of all bonds, with moore’s final film, a view to a kill, the second least successful.nevertheless, the bond brand has remained very powerful over the years and eon has had to fight off attempts by rival companies to capitalize on the popularity of the series. through a quirk of rights ownership, adaptations of casino royale (in 1967) and thunderball (as never say never again, in 1983) were released in competition with eon productions. after legal disputes that continued for many years, eon now has full control of both books.martin campbell was another experienced british director and he was able to plan one of the most elaborate stunts in bond history. in the famous opening scene of goldeneye (released in 1995), bond freefalls into a pilotless light aeroplane. this scene really helped modernize the series and increase its popularity. moreover, a whole new generation was reached through a hugely successful goldeneye video-game spin-off, which made a significant contribution to perceptions that the bond film was no longer stale and old-fashioned.nannannan
intermediate	until the end, david bowie, who has died of cancer, was still full of surprises. his latest album, blackstar, appeared on his 69th birthday on 8 january 2016 and proved that he hadn’t lost his gift for making dramatic statements as well as challenging, disturbing music.throughout the 1970s, bowie was a trailblazer of musical trends and pop fashion. he became a singer-songwriter, a pioneer of glam-rock, then got into what he called “plastic soul”, before moving to berlin to create innovative electronic music. his ability to mix brilliant changes of sound and image is unique in pop history.bowie was born david robert jones in south london. in 1953, the family moved to kent, where david showed talent for singing and playing the recorder. later, he studied art, music and design.at 15, david formed his first band, the kon-rads. it was clear that david’s talents and ambition meant that he should go solo. david took the name bowie to avoid confusion with davy jones of the monkees.bowie’s first album, released in june 1967, was titled simply david bowie. in july 1969, bowie released space oddity, the song that would give him his first commercial breakthrough. timed to coincide with the apollo 11 moon landing, it was a top five uk hit.in march 1970, bowie married art student, angela barnett. the man who sold the world was released in the us in late 1970 and in the uk the following year. with its daring songwriting and broody, hard-rock sound, it was the first album to really show his writing and performing gifts. the album’s themes included immortality, insanity, murder and mysticism, which showed that bowie was a songwriter who was thinking outside of pop’s usual boundaries.he followed it with 1972’s hunky dory, a mix of wordy, elaborate songwriting. it was an excellent collection that met with only moderate success but that all changed with the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars later that year.this time, bowie appeared as a science-fiction character – an intergalactic glam-rock star visiting planet earth. the hit single starman brought instant success for the album.everything bowie touched turned to gold. he had his first uk number 1 album with aladdin sane (1973), which included the hit singles the jean genie and drive-in saturday. but bowie was already planning his next career moves.his increasing interest in funk and soul music could be heard on the album young americans (1975), which gave him a us chart-topper with fame (with john lennon as a guest vocalist).with the album station to station (1976), bowie introduced a new persona, the thin white duke. this persona was the same as his role as a sad space traveller in nicolas roeg’s film the man who fell to earth.bowie’s relationship with his wife had been suffering under the pressures of success and the couple divorced in 1980. this was a year of further creative triumph, bringing a fine album, scary monsters (and super creeps), and its chart-topping single, ashes to ashes, followed by a period playing the title role in the elephant man on the broadway stage.he achieved a number 1 single with his 1981 partnership with queen, under pressure, and became increasingly involved with different media. he appeared in the german movie christiane f (1981) and wrote music for the soundtrack. he had another chart hit with cat people (putting out fire) from paul schrader’s movie cat people (1982).1983 was the year in which he put his energy into the album let’s dance and follow-up concerts. let’s dance turned bowie into a crowd-friendly global rock star, with the album and its singles let’s dance, china girl and modern love all becoming huge international hits.this was the heyday of mtv and bowie’s talent for eye-catching videos increased his popularity, while the six-month serious moonlight tour drew massive crowds. it was to be the most commercially successful period of his career.at the 1985 live aid famine relief concert at wembley stadium, bowie was one of the best performers. in addition, that year, he teamed up with mick jagger to record the fundraising single dancing in the street, which quickly went to number 1.a few days after his appearance at the freddie mercury tribute concert at wembley stadium in april 1992, bowie married the somalian model iman and the couple bought a home in new york.for the album black tie white noise (1993), he included elements of soul, electronica and hip hop. it topped the uk album chart and gave him a top 10 single, jump they say.new media and technology influenced his recordings, too. his 1999 album hours… was based around music he had written for a computer game called omikron, in which bowie and iman appeared as characters. the birth of bowie and iman’s daughter, alexandria, followed in august 2000.as an adopted new yorker, bowie was the opening act at the concert for new york city in october 2001, where he joined paul mccartney, jon bon jovi, billy joel, the who and elton john in a benefit show six weeks after the 9/11 attacks.during his reality tour in 2004, bowie had chest pains while performing in germany and needed emergency surgery in hamburg.he saw the medical emergency as a warning and started to slow down. in february 2006, he was given a grammy lifetime achievement award. he was entered into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1996.the next day (2013) was his first album of new material in a decade. it included the single where are we now?, which gave him his first uk top 10 hit since 1993. the album went to the top of the charts in britain and around the world. in 2014, bowie was given the brit award for best british male, making him the oldest person to get the award.he is survived by iman, their daughter,

intermediate	junior smart knows a lot about gangs. he is now 36 and his life can be divided into two phases. when he was a teenager, after his mother died, he joined a south london gang. at the time, it helped fill a big gap in his life.“they became my new support group,” he says. “at first it was just a bit of fun but then it became more serious, more and more about making money. they got involved in crime. that is how it was.” after leaving college, he got a full-time job in administration and worked as a dj. but, on the side, he was making money illegally as part of the gang.eventually he was arrested for serious drug crimes and was sent to prison for 12 years. “the first night after i was arrested was the biggest wake-up call of my life,” he says. “i had been living a double life. i had been living as one person to my peers and another person to my peers’ enemies. i spent a long time sorting myself out.”today, junior smart runs a team of 12 full-time workers and six volunteers, which aims to turn young criminals and gang members away from crime. most of the team are ex-criminals like smart. a few are still in prison but they are allowed out during the day to help. they work with the police, the probation service and other, voluntary organizations to help people who feel trapped and frightened in the violent criminal gangs of london.for smart, the extraordinary journey from gang member to mentor began when he was in prison. “i was touched by the people who kept coming back in,” he says. “i couldn’t believe that nothing was done about it. i was talking to the prisoners and they knew what changes they needed in their lives, but the problem is that the prison system only deals with the ‘index’ offence.”“one guy had a £300-a-week cocaine habit, which he paid for through burglary. he told me how he would walk into a house, even when he knew people were there. so although he had a drug addiction, that problem was never solved. the thing that shocked me is that it is simply a revolving door.”smart started working as a prison “listener” – a prisoner who helps new arrivals during their first days in prison. then he developed an idea to run his own scheme when he was out of prison – using the experience of ex-offenders to help others reject the revolving door of prison life. he was released early, after five years, and got the opportunity to put his idea into practice.so what does he think now? does he believe that things are getting better? he is careful to say positive things about the police; he says much of their work in arresting gang members has been good. but in general he is highly critical of a disjointed government approach that believes that, once the leader of a gang is arrested, the problem is solved. he agrees with a report that says the arrest of gang leaders can even make things worse. he says the effect of removing the leader is often to destabilize the entire gang.“when you arrest the top guy, everyone starts fighting for position. who was the most loyal? who had the most respect? it is a bit like a family. they are more likely to be violent. it means that the arrest of the gang leaders has been nullified because it has not had a long-term effect.”can it actually make the streets more dangerous? “it can. people take sides. if one gang knows that an elder [leader] has been arrested, then they suddenly think that gang’s weak ... and so there are gang disputes. and what happens when that elder is in prison? he forms alliances with other gang members, or when he is released he then tries to retake control. that is when violence happens.”in order to spread risk down to the lowest levels, he says gangs are now recruiting far more in primary schools. the youngest members are called “tinies”. “over the last years we have seen more and more of this. the tinies can be just eight to eleven years old.” the young protect their seniors from risk. they often do the street dealing or even the stabbing, he says.smart says that the challenges are immense, particularly with the current economic problems. “i try to help a young person who has been earning £300 a week through illegal methods. it was hard before, to try to convince him. but with unemployment high and cuts to benefits, it makes things more difficult.” however, his project, which has over 1,000 clients, is producing results. fewer than 20% of those who come in for help reoffend. smart believes that everyone deserves a second chance.nan
intermediate	scarlett johansson is suing a french novelist for û50,000. she says that his work of  ction makes fraudulent claims about her personal life.la premiere chose quon regarde (the first thing we look at) by gregoire delacourt tells the story of a french model who looks so similar to the american actor that the books lead male character thinks it is johansson herself. in the novel, the models looks mean that men see her only as a sex object, while women are jealous of her. she has a series of adventures as johansson and, in the end, dies in a car crash.johansson does not feel  attered by the best- selling book. her lawyer, vincent toledano, told le figaro that delacourtõs novel illegally used ms johanssonõs name, her reputation and her image. he said the novel contains òdefamatory claims about her private life.ó he has now gone to court to try to stop the book being translated or adapted for cinema.delacourt tried to explain that he chose to mention johansson because she is òthe archetype of beauty today.ó he said: òi wrote a work of  ction. my character is not scarlett johansson.óon french radio, the author recently said the legal action was òrather sadó. he said: òit freaks me out to think that when you talk of a character in a novel, judges can get involved.ódelacourt is one of franceõs best-loved authors; his previous novel, my list of desires, was translated into 47 languages and is now being adapted into a  lm. but he said he was òspeechlessó when he found out johansson was suing him.òi thought sheõd get in contact to ask me to go for a coffee with her. i didnõt write a novel about a celebrity,ó he said. òi wrote a real love story about feminine beauty, especially interior beauty.òif an author can no longer mention the things that surround us ð a brand of beer, a monument, an actor ð itõs going to be complicated to produce  ction.òiõm not sure sheõs even read the novel because it hasnõt been translated yet.óemmanuelle allibert, spokeswoman for publisher jc latte_s, said taking legal action was òcrazyó. òwe have never known anything like it. it is all the more surprising because the novel is not even about scarlett johansson. it is about a woman who is scarlett johanssonõs double.óironically, the authorõs legal situation would be far easier if he had published the book in johanssonõs home country, rather than france. lloyd jassin, a new york lawyer, said that the case would most likely not go to court in the united states because the book would be protected by the first amendment.he said that, if thereõs signi cance and literary merit to using her name in the book, the first amendment would protect the authorõs right to do so. however, in france, the legal position is more complicated and personality rights are taken òmuch more seriously,ó jassin says.òi thought she might send me  owers as the book was a declaration of love for her, but she didnõt understand,ó delacourt said.nannan
intermediate	the world shares him and london claims him but stratford-upon-avon intends to spend 2016 celebrating william shakespeare as their man: the bard of avon, born in the warwickshire market town in 1564, who died there 400 years ago.stratford remained hugely important during shakespeareõs life, says paul edmondson, the head of learning and research at the shakespeare birthplace trust. òpeople often see shakespeare as someone who turned his back on stratford and his family, went to london to earn his fortune and only came back to die,ó he said. òbut stratford is where he bought land and property, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought. we are going to spend the year re-emphasizing the importance of shakespeare, the man of stratford.óthe anniversary of the death of the man from stratford, the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world, will be celebrated across britain and the globe. macbeth will open in singapore, romeo and juliet in brussels. shakespeareõs globe is completing the  rst world tour in the history of theatre. it has taken hamlet to every country except north korea. in london, they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema, one screen to showcase each of shakespeareõs plays.the national theatre, the royal shakespeare company and nearly every other theatre production company in the country will celebrate the anniversary. interpretations of the plays will range from the highly traditional to the experimental. there will also be hundreds of lectures, recitals, international academic conferences,  lms, concerts, operas and major exhibitions.for a man famous in his own lifetime, there is little documentary evidence for shakespeareõs life and times. the plays would probably not have survived if his friends and fellow actors had not gathered together every bit of every play they could  nd ð drafts, prompt scripts, scribbled actorsõ parts and 17 plays not known in any other version ð into the precious first folio published in 1623, seven years after shakespeareõs death.the actor mark rylance has called it his favourite book in the world and most of the surviving first folios will be on display ð including those belonging to the british and bodleian libraries, and a tattered copy recently discovered in france. some of the most precious surviving documents will be collected together in an exhibition at somerset house in london, including four of his six known signatures, which are all slightly different.the exhibition, by me, william shakespeare, will include his will, the court papers relating to the audacious move when shakespeare and his fellow actors dismantled a theatre on the north side of the thames and rebuilt it as the globe on the south bank, and accounts showing payments from the royal treasury for boxing day performances for james i and queen anne.the director of the globe, dominic dromgoole, recently jokily claimed shakespeare was a true londoner. stratford, however, will be insisting that the town made and educated shakespeare. they are restoring his old school room. it will open as a permanent visitor attraction.shakespeare bought the splendid new place, the second best house in the town, where he died, according to literary legend, on st georgeõs day, 23 april, the same day as his birth. òyou donõt buy a house like new place and not live there,ó paul edmondson said. òthe general public and many academics have consistently underestimated the importance of stratford to shakespeare.óedmondson believes that, after shakespeare bought the house in 1597, all his thinking time was spent there and that the late plays, including the tempest, were at least planned in his library and probably written there. the shakespeare birthplace trust describes new place as òthe jewel in the crown of the 400th anniversary celebrationsó.however, shakespeareõs house was demolished 300 years ago and the house that replaced it was demolished in 1759 by a bad-tempered priest, francis gastrell, in an argument over taxes. he had already cut down shakespeareõs mulberry tree, under which the writer is said to have sat and worked, because he was irritated by all the tourists peering into his garden.the gap where the house was has never been  lled. but the news that shakespeareõs kitchen had been found in the partly surviving cellars went round the world. the whole site is being displayed for the anniversary, with the oundations marked and the garden restored. òwithout stratford,ó edmondson said, òthere would have been no shakespeare.ónan
elementary	a group of experts say that thousands of people are taking unnecessary medicines and have bad diets because of bogus allergy tests. allergies and food intolerances are increasing very quickly but people do not understand the difference between an allergy and a food intolerance – this is causing problems, says the charity sense about science, who have written a guide to allergies.“it’s a big mess,” said tracey brown, director of sense about science. “there is unnecessary action for people who don’t really have allergies and not enough action for people who have allergies.”lots of people tell the waiter or waitress in a restaurant that they have an allergy. but some of these people don’t have an allergy – that have a food intolerance, which is not dangerous. experts fear that restaurants hear so many people say that they have allergies (when maybe that is not true) that they may not be careful enough when they give food to a person who has a real allergy.“it matters very much,” said moira austin of an allergy charity. “if a restaurant thinks somebody just doesn’t want to eat a food because it makes them feel uncomfortable, the restaurant may be less careful. there have been deaths where people have gone to a restaurant, told the waiter or waitress that they have an allergy to a food and the meal has been given to them containing that food.”the guide says most allergy tests bought on the internet or in shops do not work. they include a test people can use at home, which looks for specific antibodies against different foods in the blood. these antibodies are part of the body’s response to infections but “the best medical evidence has shown high antibody levels do not suggest an allergy”, the guide says. the test often shows people have an allergy or a food intolerance when this is not true.another test also does not work. it uses a mixture of acupuncture and homeopathy. testing hair is also pointless, the guide says. “hair cannot show if you are allergic or not so testing hair cannot give any useful information on allergies.”“i often see children who are on very limited diets – their parents believe that they have allergies because they have taken ‘allergy tests’ that do not work,” said paul seddon, an allergy doctor for children. “this needs to stop, which can only happen if we prove these ‘tests’ do not work.”allergies can cause tiredness, headaches and eczema in children. but you need to check if they have an allergy and this takes a long time and many tests. it may seem like a good idea to do just one test and get a quick answer. but, it will be a wrong answer.allergies are increasing in developed countries. there are three times more children with certain allergies now compared to 30 years ago. the sense about science guide lists a number of myths about the sources of allergies, for example the myths that fast food or e numbers in food colourings cause allergies.nan
elementary	water scientists have given a very strong warning about the world’s food supplies. they say that everyone may have to change to a vegetarian diet by 2050.we believe there will be an extra two billion people in the world by 2050. humans get about 20% of their protein from animal-based products now, but this may need to decrease to just 5% to feed these extra people, say the world’s top water scientists.“there will not be enough water to produce food for the nine-billion population in 2050 if more people start eating like people in the west,” the report by malik falkenmark and colleagues at the stockholm international water institute (siwi) said.“there will be enough water if the percentage of animal-based foods is limited to 5% of total calories.”there are warnings that water shortages will limit food production. at the same time, oxfam and the un prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years. prices for food items such as corn and wheat have increased nearly 50% on international markets since june. the price increase has been caused by very bad droughts in the us and russia, and weak monsoon rains in asia. more than 18 million people already have serious food shortages across the sahel.oxfam says that the effects of price increases will be very bad in developing countries that need to buy food from other countries, including parts of latin america, north africa and the middle east. food shortages in 2008 led to fighting in 28 countries.changing to a vegetarian diet is one way to keep more water to grow food, the scientists said. animal protein-rich food uses five to ten times more water than vegetarian food. one third of the world’s farmland is used to grow crops to feed animals.“nine hundred million people already don’t have enough food and two million people are malnourished, even though we are producing more food,” they said. “70% of all water is used in farming, and growing more food to feed an extra two billion people by 2050 will put more pressure on water and land.”the report was released at the start of the annual world water conference in stockholm, sweden, where 2,500 politicians, un groups, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries met to discuss global water supply problems.eating too much, malnourishment and waste are all increasing. “we will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future,” said the report’s editor, anders jägerskog.nannannannannan
elementary	the international monetary fund (imf) has asked the usa to manage its money better. hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work after the government shut down for 16 days.us president barack obama said that the us has to be more careful with how it manages its money. the imf’s managing director, christine lagarde, asked for more stability.the senate wrote a peace deal, which included almost nothing that the conservatives asked for. the conservative republicans nearly caused a new financial crisis because they did not agree to obama’s healthcare reforms. the house of representatives agreed the deal at the last minute.the world bank was also pleased that the world’s economy had “avoided a catastrophe”. its president, jim yong kim, asked politicians in all countries to continue to make policies that improve the economy and give jobs and opportunity to all.the shutdown cost the us $24 billion.obama signed the legislation shortly after midnight on thursday. the bill passed easily, with support from all parties in the senate, where democratic and republican leaders wrote the agreement. it is a temporary solution. it gives the government money until 15 january and allows the government to borrow more money if they want to until 7 february.but the president made clear that he did not expect another serious budget fight and shutdown in 2014.at the white house, obama said he hoped the deal would “lift the cloud of uncertainty” that had hung over the country in recent weeks.“when this agreement arrives on my desk, i will sign it immediately,” he said. “hopefully, next time, it won’t be in the eleventh hour. we must manage our money better.”a journalist asked the president if the crisis would happen again in a few months. obama replied: “no.”earlier, the republican senator mike lee said there would be more trouble: “the media keeps asking: ‘was it worth it?’ my answer is, it is always worth it to do the right thing.” he added: “this is not over.”but the political deal on wednesday was one of the worst of all possible results for republicans. they did not achieve any of their goals and most people blamed them for the crisis.nannannan
elementary	more than one million british workers might be employed on zero-hours contracts. this number comes from a poll of more than 1,000 employers by the chartered institute of personnel and development (cipd).recently, some uk organizations ð from shops to buckingham palace ð have been criticized for employing staff without a guarantee of work and pay each week. employees on zero-hours contracts often get no holiday or sick pay and have to ask permission before looking for extra work with another company.the cipd found that 38% of zero-hours contract workers describe themselves as employed full-time. they say they typically work 30 hours or more a week. one-third of voluntary sector employers use the contracts and one in four public sector organizations.the retail company sports direct employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on zero-hours contracts. other companies using the contracts include cinema chain cineworld and buckingham palace, which uses the contracts for its 350 summer workers. pub group j d wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff ð 80% of its workforce ð on zero-hours contracts.vidhya alakeson, from the resolution foundation, said: òif itõs true that there are around one million people on zero-hours contracts, then that would be a big part of the workforce.óunions say that employers put pressure on staff to sign the contracts. in this way, the employers can avoid their responsibilities to employees and reduce staff bene ts.dave prentis, of the trade union unison, said: òthe majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice.óworkers on zero-hours contracts are often only told how many hours they will work when weekly or monthly rotas are created. but they have to be available for extra work at short notice. they may get holiday pay, but they do not get sick pay.the charity national trust, which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts, said it gives the same pay and bene ts to workers on zero-hours contracts as to full-time staff.òwe believe zero-hours contracts are essential in our organization, because we are very weather-dependent,ó the national trust said. òitõs important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.ópolitician chuka umunna said, òwhile some employees welcome the  exibility of zero-hours contracts, for many, zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come,ó he said.the poll shows that 17% of employers in the private sector use zero-hours contracts, lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.industries where employers were most likely to have at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).nannannannan
elementary	felix baumgartner stood at the edge of space above new mexico and paused for a moment. it was a small step away from the capsule, but a 24-mile drop back down to earth. “our guardian angel will take care of you,” said mission control, and baumgartner jumped.ten frightening minutes later, the austrian landed back on earth. he fell at speeds of up to 725 miles per hour, and he broke three world records. he became the world’s first supersonic skydiver when he broke the sound barrier. “we love you felix,” shouted his team in the control room.he was wearing a special suit to protect him against the very big pressure changes during the jump. without the suit, a man’s blood would boil and his lungs would explode. baumgartner later said that all he could think about was getting back alive, but he also said: “sometimes you have to go up really high to see how small you are.”his other two records were for the highest altitude manned balloon flight and the highest altitude skydive. the jump was on a sunny morning in good weather. baumgartner went up into clear skies in an enormous balloon – it was 30 million square cubic feet and its skin was one-tenth the thickness of a sandwich bag. at the bottom of the balloon was a capsule, where baumgartner sat in his suit.at the correct height, baumgartner went through a checklist of 40 things with his helper joe kittinger. kittinger held the record for the highest altitude manned balloon flight before baumgartner. baumgartner had a problem with his visor. “this is very serious, joe,” he told kitttinger. “i can’t see when i breathe out.” but they decided to continue, and a record 8 million people watched live on youtube.the ascent, during which the skies slowly turned black, took two and a half hours. but the descent was much quicker. three cameras, which were attached to baumgartner’s suit, recorded his free-fall of just over four minutes and then the parachute opening.baumgartner has done lots of dangerous things before. he has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave. he did two practice free-falls to prepare for this jump – one from 71,000 feet and a second from 97,000 feet. but nothing can compare with his jump above the town of roswell, a place famous for its ufo sightings.he was trying to break five different records: the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free-fall; the highest free-fall altitude jump; the highest manned balloon flight; the longest free-fall; and his jump platform is probably the largest manned balloon in history. the jump beat two of kittinger’s records: before, the retired us air force colonel held the high altitude and speed records for parachuting. kittinger jumped from a balloon 19 miles above the earth in 1960 and gave advice to baumgartner during the ascent.someone asked him, “what do you want to do next?” baumgartner said: “i want to inspire young people. i’d like to sit in the same place in the next four years as joe kittinger. if there is a young guy who wants to break my record, i want to give him advice.” he said the most exciting moment for him was when he was standing outside the capsule “on top of the world”. he added: “the most beautiful moment was when i was standing on the landing area and mike todd [the man who dressed baumgartner in his suit] came and he had a smile on his face like a little kid.”baumgartner said that he felt like todd’s son. he said: “todd was so happy that i was alive.” earlier, todd said: “the world needs a hero right now, and they have got one in felix baumgartner.” this will be the last jump, baumgartner said. he has promised to settle down with his girlfriend, and fly helicopters on rescue missions in the us and austria.nannannannan
elementary	people today might not hear the sounds of the natural world because they screen out the noises around them, says a us researcher.more background noise can make people oblivious to the uplifting sounds of birdsong, water and trees in the wind. you can often hear these sounds even in cities, said kurt fristrup, a senior scientist at the us national park service.the problem is even worse because people listen to music through their earphones instead of listening to the birds and other sounds of nature. natural sounds are easily drowned out by traf c, music and others noises, fristrup said.òthis learned deafness is a real problem,ó fristrup told the american association for the advancement of science meeting in san jose. òwe are training ourselves to ignore the information that comes into our ears.òthis gift that we are born with ð the ability to hear things hundreds of metres away, all these incredible sounds ð might be lost,ó he said.this is the problem: we hear so many noises that we stop listening.for the past ten years, the us national park service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 parks in the us, including yosemite in california, yellowstone and denali in alaska. there was noise from human activity in all the parks, for example aircraft, motorbikes, motorboats and tour buses.fristrupõs team say that noise pollution more than doubles every 30 years. òitõs not surprising people put on earphones,ó he said.òmore background noise has the same effect on your hearing as fog has on your vision ð you are aware of only a small area around you,ó he said. even in our cities, there are birds and things to appreciate in the environment but we are losing the ability to hear them.people quickly become used to changes in their environments, including more noise. fristrup worries that we will forget how much quieter the world could be. òif  nding peace and quiet becomes too dif cult, many children will grow up without the experience and i think itõs a very big problem,ó he said.other scientists reported health bene ts from listening to natural sounds. speaking at the same meeting, derrick taff, a social scientist at pennsylvania state university, said that listening to recordings from national parks, of waterfalls, birdsong and wind, helped people feel less stressed.òwe know that natural sounds are very important to people. they are some of the main reasons people visit protected areas. they want to hear the natural quiet, the birdsong, and the wind and water,ó taff said. òwe may be losing this as people are listening to their ipods all the time. my advice is to go to your protected areas and experience what you are missing.ónannannan
elementary	when larry pizzi first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago, he asked: “why would anyone want to spoil a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it?”it’s a question that some people still ask. many bicycle shops in the us do not sell e-bikes.pizzi is ceo of currie technologies, the number one seller of e-bikes in the us. he believes that things will change very soon. other people who sell bikes agree. familiar brands including trek, raleigh and specialized all offer electric bikes and they believe that the market is going to grow.the us is different from other countries when it comes to electric bikes. nearly 32 million e-bikes were sold in 2014, most of them in china, where people mostly use them for transportation. they are popular in many parts of europe, too. they’re common in the netherlands and switzerland; german postal workers use them and bmw sells one for about $3,000.electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds, which use motors; you pedal an electric bike with – or without – help from an electric motor. riding an e-bike feels like riding a normal bike with a strong wind behind you; the motor just helps you go faster or climb hills. you can usually ride e-bicycles on bike lanes and they can’t travel faster than 20mph.e-bikes are banned in some states in the us, including new york. some bike shops don’t like putting motors on bicycles because it makes them too heavy. some e-bikes weigh nearly 30kg.e-bikes are also expensive. while cheap bikes sell for just $700, you will pay at least $1,500 for a quality e-bike with a good battery. the best bikes cost more than $3,000.but e-bike technology, particularly the batteries, is improving. “batteries are getting smaller, they’re getting lighter, they’re getting more reliable and they are lasting longer,” says don dicostanza, the ceo of pedego, an electric bikemaker and retailer.perhaps most importantly, more cities are building bike lanes so bicycle commuting has become more popular. electric bikes make commuting more practical – and fun – because people don’t have to worry about hills, strong winds, tiredness and sweat.most of our customers are “baby boomers who want to have the cycling experience they had as a kid,” says pedego’s don dicostanza. “the main reason they stopped riding bikes was because of hills.” pedego has opened nearly 60 stores in the us.electrobike has 30 stores in mexico. it opened its first american store in venice beach, california in 2014 and hopes to have 25 us stores in a year. ceo craig anderson says: “we want to help reduce traffic, help reduce our carbon footprint and encourage a healthy lifestyle.” he tells customers: “ride this bike once and try not to smile.”currie’s larry pizzi thinks that e-bikes will become popular in north america. “a lot of young people are using e-bikes for transportation, instead of cars.”there is even a cargo bike with a stronger motor and rack at the back. “you can carry two children,” says pizzi. “you can carry 45kg of shopping. it’s a minivan alternative.”nannannannan
elementary	the duke and duchess of cambridge have won the first part of their fight for privacy. a french magazine was told to stop selling or reusing photos of the royal couple. the pictures show the duchess sunbathing topless while on holiday in the south of france.it is possible that the magazine editor and the photographer or photographers will also have to go to a criminal court.the french magazine closer was told to give digital files of the pictures to the couple within 24 hours.closer’s publisher, mondadori magazines france, was also told to pay €2,000 in legal costs. the magazine will have to pay €10,000 for every day it does not give the couple the files.the court decided that every time mondadori – the publishing company owned by the ex italian prime minister silvio berlusconi – publishes a photograph in the future in france, they will get €10,000 fine.the couple welcome the judge’s decision. “they always believed the law was broken and that they had a right to their privacy.”the royal couple are pleased with the decision, but they want to have a much more public criminal trial against the magazine and photographer or photographers.under french law, if you do not respect someone’s privacy, you may have to spend a maximum of one year in prison and pay a fine of €45,000.this punishment would send a message to the world and, the couple hope, stop paparazzi taking photos like this in the future.on saturday the irish daily star also published the photos. and the italian celebrity magazine chi published a special edition of 26 pages with the photos of the future queen.nannannannannannannan
elementary	the last time she performed, we did not have mobile phones. now, 35 years later, as she performs again, singer kate bush sees a very different world.these days, most concerts are now lit up with phones and tablets, but bush does not want her fans to watch her shows through a screen.in august, before her concerts at the hammersmith apollo in london, bush asked her fans to put down their mobile phones at her gigs.bush wrote on her website: “i have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows. we have chosen a theatre, not a large venue or stadium. please do not take photos or videos during the shows.“i very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iphones, ipads or cameras.”bush is not the first singer or musician to say she doesn’t like phones at concerts. roger daltrey from the who recently said it was “weird” that people looked at their screen and not the artist on stage.he said: “i feel sorry for them, i really feel sorry for them. looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally – if you’re doing that, you’re 50% there, right? it’s weird.”in 2013, beyoncé told a fan, “you can’t even sing because you’re too busy filming. put that damn camera down!”recently, dutch football fans at psv eindhoven protested against the introduction of wi-fi in their stadium. they held up banners that said “no wi-fi. support the team,” and “you can sit at home.” manchester united have also told fans to leave their “large electronic devices” at home.singer jarvis cocker said, “it seems stupid to have something happening in front of you and look at it on a screen that’s smaller than a cigarette packet.”even in the world of classical music, one of the world’s top pianists surprised the audience in june 2013 when he left the stage because a fan was filming his performance on a smartphone. krystian zimerman returned moments later and said: “the destruction of music because of youtube is enormous.”but sam watt says that filming at concerts makes the experience even better. he works for vyclone, a phone app that puts together many videos uploaded by fans to create one long video of a show.“fans filming is now part of the concert experience – that is a just a fact. we take the videos that people are filming at concerts and mix them together with everybody else who was filming. the result is a really fantastic video,” he said.“we think that filming at concerts adds to the experience, and i think that, if kate bush came round for a cup of tea, we could have a really interesting discussion about this,” he added. “people are going to film and they want those memories – you’ve got to accept it.”nannannannannannan
elementary	many of us know we donõt get enough sleep but imagine if there was a simple solution: getting up later. in a speech at the british science festival, dr paul kelley from oxford university said schools should stagger their starting times to work with the natural rhythms of their students. this would improve exam results and studentsõ health (lack of sleep can cause diabetes, depression, obesity and other health problems).dr kelley said that, when children are around ten, their natural wake-up time is about 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and, at 18, a personõs natural waking hour is 9am, although you may think they are just a lazy teenager. the normal school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not for 16- to 18-year-olds. for the older teenagers, it might be better to start the school day at 11am or even later. òa 7am wake-up time for older teenagers,ó says kelley, òis the same as a 4.30am start for a teacher in their 50s.óhe says the solution is not to tell teenagers to go to bed earlier. òthe bodyõs natural rhythm is controlled by a particular kind of light,ó says kelley. òthe eye has cells that report to a part of the brain that controls our sleep rhythms over a 24-hour cycle. itõs the light that controls it.óbut it isnõt just students who would bene t from a later start. kelley says the working day should be more linked to our natural rhythms. describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: òbetween 14 and 24, people lose more than two hours. for people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35, they lose about an hour and a half. that can continue up until youõre about 55 when itõs in balance again. the 10-year-old and 55-year-old wake and sleep naturally at the same time.óso, should workplaces have staggered starting times, too? should people in their 50s and above come in at 8am, people in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage apprentice at 11am? kelley says that synchronized hours could have òmany positive effects. the positive side is that peopleõs performance, mood and health will improve. itõs very positive because itõs a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.óthere would probably be fewer accidents because drivers would be more awake, he says. it could mean the end of rush hour because people would stagger their work times and the times of their school run. a later start to the day for many, says kelley, òis something that would bene t all people, particularly families. parents go and try to wake up teenagers who are waking up three hours too early. it creates problems for everybody.óso, what time does kelley start work? òi am 67 so that means iõm like a 10-year-old and i get up just after six. i wake naturally.ó and, yes, he says he  nds the start of his working day much easier now than when he was younger.
advanced	vienna is the worldõs best city to live in, baghdad is the worst and london, paris and new york do not even make it into the top 35, according to international research into quality of life.german-speaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th mercer quality of life study, with vienna joined by zurich, munich, dusseldorf and frankfurt in the top seven.paris has tumbled down the league, falling ten places to 37th, just ahead of london at 39th, almost entirely because of the cityõs vulnerability to terrorist attacks.the study examined social and economic conditions, health, education, housing and the environment, and is used by big companies to assess where they should locate and how much they should pay staff.viennese-born helena hartlauer, 32, said she was not surprised at her cityõs top position. the municipalityõs social democratic government has a long tradition of investing in high-quality social housing, making vienna almost uniquely affordable among major cities.òi live in a 100sq-metre turn-of-the-century apartment in a good area about 20 minutesõ walk from the city centre. but my rent is just û800 (£625) a month.ó an equivalent apartment in london would cost upwards of £2,000 and even more in new york, ranked 44th in the table.us cities perform relatively poorly in the study, largely because of issues around personal safety and crime. the highest ranking city in the us is san francisco, at 28th; boston is 34th. canadian cities, led by vancouver, far outrank their us rivals in the table.òyou donõt realize how safe vienna is until you head abroad,ó said hartlauer. òwe also have terri c public transport, with the underground working 24 hours at weekends, and it only costs û1 per trip.óvienna bene ted enormously from the fall of the berlin wall, becoming the gateway to eastern european countries that often have historic ties to the former austro-hungarian empire.òour big usp is our geographical location,ó said martin eichtinger, austrian ambassdaor to london, who lived in vienna for 20 years. òthe fall of the berlin wall helped de ne vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in central europe.óaccording to the world bank, austria has one of the highest  gures for gdp per head in the world, just behind the us and ahead of germany and britain, although quite some way below neighbouring switzerland.zurich in switzerland is named by mercer as having the worldõs second highest quality of life but the viennese say their city is far more fun. òthere are more students in vienna than any other german-speaking city,ó said hartlauer. òitõs a very fast growing, young and lively city,ó she added ð though she conceded she works for the cityõs tourist board.vienna has long been overlooked by british weekend city break tourists, who instead  ock to barcelona or berlin and tend to think of austria as somewhere for skiing, lakes and mountains.but, after an increase in budget  ights from regional british cities such as manchester and edinburgh, vienna is fast catching up as a popular destination. in 2015, there were 588,000 british visitors to vienna, up 18% on the year before. the  ow is both ways; eichtinger said london has become the number one city destination for austrian visitors.òvienna has ranked top in the last seven published rankings,ó said mercer. òit scores highly in a number of categories; it provides a safe and stable environment to live in, a high level of public utilities and transport facilities and good recreational facilities.óthe european migrant crisis, which has seen large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers pass through vienna en route to germany, has had little impact on the city of nearly 1.8 million people, said eichtinger. òwe have managed to accommodate 90,000 refugees in austria but the numbers have slowed in recent months.ólondon has never been in the quality-of-life top ten, says mercer, damaged by its poor scores for air pollution, traf c congestion and climate. after london, edinburgh is the next-ranking british city, in 46th place.paris has suffered the biggest fall in the most recent rankings. òparis remained stable for several years but has, this year, dropped ten places in the overall ranking,ó said mercer.òthe drop was essentially due to the terrorist attacks in 2015. however, it is important to highlight that safety issues are a very highly weighted factor within the ôbasketõ so any small adjustments can have a big impact on the ranking.óauckland in new zealand was the highest ranking english-speaking city in the survey, in third place, followed by vancouver in  fth. australian cities also perform very highly in the survey, with sydney 10th and melbourne 15th. the economist has consistently ranked melbourne as the worldõs most liveable city, although its survey has been criticized as too anglocentric.war and political unrest are behind all the worst-ranked cities in the world. surprisingly, damascus is named as only the seventh worst, ranked better than not just baghdad but also bangui in central african republic, sanaõa in yemen, port-au-prince in haiti, khartoum in sudan and nõdjamena in chad.
advanced	from all across rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring burundi, people  ock to the southern town of butare to a little shop called inzozi nziza (sweet dreams). they come for a taste of the unknown, something most have never tasted ð the sweet, cold, velvety embrace of ice cream.here, at the central african countryõs  rst ice- cream parlour, customers can buy scoops in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple  avours. toppings include fresh fruit, honey, chocolate chips and granola. black tea and coffee are also on sale.the shop, which has òice cream, coffee, dreamsó across its signage, is milking local curiosity about the dessert ð and òchanging livesó in the process, says inzozi nzizaõs manager, louise ingabire.òice cream is important,ó she says between mouthfuls of a honey- avoured offering. òsome rwandans like ice cream, but itõs a new thing. we still have some work to do, to tell others that theyõll enjoy it.ótrue to inzozi nzizaõs motto, the shop can certainly make dreams come true. òi didnõt have a job before: i just stayed at home. now, i have a vision for the future. i am making money and i can give some of it to my family,ó says the 27-year-old.butare, which has 89,600 residents and is located 135km south of the capital, kigali, is the home of the national university of rwanda. inzozi nziza has become a hub for tired students looking to treat themselves to something cool and different.òitõs something uniting people here,ó kalisa migendo, a 24-year-old agriculture student, says. òif you need to go out and talk to a friend, a girl or a boy, you come to inzozi nziza for an ice cream.ómost of the ingredients are sourced locally and the milk comes from a depot in nearby nyanza. the vanilla beans and cocoa are imported.inzozi nziza was opened by the theatre director odile gakire katese. she met alexis miesen and jennie dundas, co-founders of blue marble ice cream in brooklyn, new york, and formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010.òan ice-cream shop, katese proposed, might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits, hopes and family traditions,ó miesen says.at the start, miesen and dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative and non-pro t. they did not set  nancial targets, but waited for 18 months before they transferred their shares to the women, who had by then proved their business credentials.the shopõs success is no exception, says fatuma ndangiza, deputy chief executive of the rwanda governance board. òsmall businesses are mostly managed by women but when it comes to big business where you have to compete for big tenders, very few women are there. women are newcomers to big business,ó she points out. òwe have more women entrepreneurs. itõs an area where women are taking an interest, both in and outside kigali.óthough ice cream is somewhat new to rwanda, ndangiza is enthused by the idea of the shop. òi think itõs great. it requires a lot of skills and changing peopleõs mindsets because selling and eating ice cream is not part of our culture. i think being able to innovate and introduce this on the market, and the process of making it, is quite interesting.óthe butare shop employs nine women, who spend their spare time practising with ingoma nshya, rwandaõs  rst and only female drumming troupe, which was established by katese ten years ago.the musicians are hutu and tutsi women, some survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million tutsis and moderate hutus were killed.some members of ingoma nshya are widows, some orphans. others have been affected by the massacre in different ways.historically, says ingabire, rwandan women were forbidden to drum and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry. òbut itõs something which brings unity.óingabireõs father, two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide. òsome of us are survivors; some know someone who was killed,ó she says. òwhen iõm drumming with them, it gives me power because weõre still alive and survivors.óthe popular eatery features in a documentary by rob and lisa fruchtman, sibling  lm-makers. sweet dreams, which tells the story of how the women have forged a promising post-genocide future, also includes the female drummers.the  lm, which has been screened in more than a dozen countries, including the us, uk and several african states, premieres in rwanda in 2014. òwe feel the  lm is about resilience, hope, bravery, resourcefulness and the ability to change the course of your own life,ó says lisa fruchtman, who won an academy award for  lm- editing in 1984.
advanced	the mass collection of telephone records by government surveillance programmes poses a clear threat to the personal privacy of ordinary citizens, according to us researchers who used basic phone logs to identify people and uncover confidential information about their lives.armed with anonymous “metadata” on people’s calls and texts, but not the content of the communications, two scientists at stanford university worked out individuals’ names, where they lived and the names of their partners. but that was not all.the same data led them to uncover potentially sensitive information about some individuals. one man was found to own a rifle, while another had recently been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. other data pointed to a new pregnancy and a person with multiple sclerosis.the results highlight the extraordinary power of telephone metadata – the number called, when and for how long – particularly when it is paired with public information available from services such as google, yelp and facebook. the value of the data, which is not subject to the same legal protections as the content of people’s communications, has long been recognized by the security services. as stewart baker, the former general counsel at the us national security agency (nsa), put it in the aftermath of edward snowden’s revelations: “metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody’s life.”patrick mutchler, a computer security researcher at stanford, said that while the power of metadata was understood by those gathering the information, the public was largely in the dark because so few published studies have revealed how rich the data is. “that makes it difficult for people with strong opinions about these programmes to fight them. now, we have hard evidence we can point to that didn’t exist in the past,” he said.for the study, the researchers signed up 823 people who agreed to have metadata collected from their phones through an android app. the app also received information from their facebook accounts, which the scientists used to check the accuracy of their results. in all, the researchers gathered metadata on more than 250,000 calls and over 1.2m texts.analysts who logged into the nsa’s metadata-gathering system were initially allowed to examine data up to three hops away from an individual. a call from the target individual’s phone to another number was one hop. from that phone to another was two hops. and so on. the records available to analysts stretched back for five years. the collection window has now been restricted to two hops and 18 months at most.writing in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences, mutchler describes how, on a shoestring budget, he and fellow graduate student, jonathan mayer, uncovered a wealth of personal information, some of it sensitive, about people who took part in the study. through automatic and manual searches, they identified 82% of people’s names. the same technique gave them the names of businesses the people had called. when these were plotted on a map, they revealed clusters of local businesses, which the scientists speculated surrounded the person’s home address. in this way, they named the city people lived in 57% of the time, and were nearly 90% accurate in placing people within 50 miles of their home. mutchler believes some of the misses came from people not updating their facebook page when they moved out of their parents’ home, for example, to go to college.the scientists next delved into more personal territory. using a simple computer program to analyse people’s call patterns, they inferred who among the study volunteers was in a relationship. once they knew the owner of a particular number had a partner, identifying the significant other was easy, they report.for the final part of the study, the researchers delved even deeper, to see what sensitive information they could glean from telephone metadata. they gathered details on calls made to and from a list of organizations, including hospitals, pharmacies, religious groups, legal services, firearms retailers and repair firms. from these, they pieced together some extraordinary vignettes from people’s lives.the metadata from one person in the study showed they had a long call from a cardiology centre, spoke briefly with a medical laboratory, answered a number of short calls from a local pharmacy and then made calls to a hotline for abnormal heart-rate monitoring devices. another participant made frequent calls to a local gun supplier that specialized in semiautomatic rifles and later placed a number of long calls to the customer support hotline run by a major gun manufacturer that produced the rifles. the metadata from two others suggested one had multiple sclerosis and the other had just become pregnant.“all of this should be taken as an indication of what is possible with two graduate students and limited resources,” said mutchler, who argues that the findings should make policymakers think twice before authorizing mass surveillance programmes. “large-scale metadata surveillance programmes, like the nsa’s, will necessarily expose highly confidential information about ordinary citizens,” the scientists write, adding: “to strike an appropriate balance between national security and civil liberties, future policymaking must be informed by input from relevant sciences.”ross anderson, professor of security engineering at cambridge university, said the study provided numbers that discussions can now be based on. “with the right analytics running over nationscale communications data, you can infer huge amounts of sensitive information on everyone. we always suspected that, of course, but here’s the data.”
advanced	tigers are more numerous in nepal than at any time since the 1970s, a new census has revealed, giving conservationists hope that the big cats, whose numbers have been dropping across south asia for 100 years, can be saved.the number of wild royal bengal tigers in nepal has increased to 198 – a 63.6% rise in five years – the government survey showed. “this is very encouraging,” said maheshwar dhakal, an ecologist with nepal’s department of national parks and wildlife conservation.the census is based on the examination of pictures from more than 500 cameras placed in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors. more than 250 conservationists and wildlife experts worked on the survey, which cost about £250,000. dhakal said that a parallel survey was conducted in india and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013. “it will take a few more months for india, which now has 1,300 big cats in several huge protected areas, to finalize the data,” he added. nepal has pledged to double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 when the last systematic tiger count took place.increasing prosperity in asia has pushed up prices for tiger skins and the body parts used in traditional chinese medicines. international gangs pay poor local nepali significant sums to kill the cats. the skin and bones are handed to middlemen, who pass easily through the porous border to india, where the major dealers are based.one major problem is complicity between senior officials and mafia networks involved in the trade. conservation experts credit the increase in numbers to the effective policing of national parks, stronger anti-poaching drives and better management of tiger habitats in nepal, where forests cover 29% of the land. but they say nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers prey so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat.as the number of tigers has increased over the years, so have incidents of conflict with villagers. seven people were killed in attacks by tigers around national parks in 2012 compared to four in 2011, park officials said. villagers are also seeking better protection. “the government is making conservation plans for tigers. but it should also come up with plans to protect people from tigers,” krishna bhurtel, a local village headman in chitwan, told nepali newspaper nagarik. wildlife authorities captured a tiger in chitwan after it killed two people, including a villager who was pulled from his bed in may.thousands of tigers once roamed the forests in bangladesh, india and nepal. but their numbers have dropped to about 3,000, a 95% drop over a century. chitwan national park in central nepal has the highest number of adult tigers, with 120, followed by bardiya national park (50) and shukla phanta wildlife reserve (17).diwakar chapagain, who heads a world wildlife fund nepal unit that monitors wildlife trade, said tiger skins were in demand in tibet, where well-heeled people use them as festival costumes.in nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins in front of stuffed tigers for special occasions. some affluent nepali have mounted tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms. tiger bones are in high demand for use in traditional chinese medicines. “the trade in tiger parts is lucrative and fetches thousands of dollars in illegal markets,” chapagain said, highlighting the threat tigers face.
advanced	an international agreement to improve safety in bangladesh’s clothing factories is facing the threat of legal action as factory owners demand compensation for the cost of closures and repair work. with some repair programmes expected to take months, factory owners say they cannot shoulder the costs of paying staff while factories are closed, alongside the expense of some major works needed to ensure buildings are safe. the building overhauls are being carried out in the wake of the collapse of the rana plaza complex in the capital of bangladesh, dhaka, in 2013, in which 1,138 people were killed.the problems come as hundreds of bangladeshi clothing factories per month are inspected for firesafety and structural problems under the accord on fire and building safety in bangladesh, which is backed by over 170 international brands, including primark and marks & spencer, and international trade unions, including industriall.the owner of one dhaka-based factory, softex cotton, has threatened legal action against the accord after his factory was closed down due to structural problems, prompting a demand for a reported $100m in compensation.another factory owner, who declined to be named, said that once a factory closed its doors, even for a few months, it would lose orders and close permanently: “there is no such thing as temporary closure,” he said. the factory owner said that the accord agreement had “pussyfooted” around the issue of who paid for factory closures amid efforts to get as many brands as possible to sign up to a deal in the wake of the rana plaza disaster. he said there was no clear process in place to handle the costs involved.jenny holdcroft, policy director for industriall, which has been closely involved in the accord, said that the agreement ensured that factories would not lose orders during closure because brands had committed to maintain orders with suppliers for two years.while 12 factories have been identified so far by the accord as needing significant work, holdcroft said many of those only needed partial closure in order to reduce stress on the building so production could continue on other floors. the accord also legally binds brands to ensure that workers are paid during factory closures. she said the detail on who would make payments had been left open in order to ensure that all those factory owners who could afford to pay for repairs and compensation for workers made the necessary contribution.“this was always going to be a topic of negotiation. brands don’t want to commit to paying so that rich factory owners who have just pocketed the profits and not been spending on their factories for years continue to do so. there was obviously going to be disruption. if there was no disruption, there would be no change,” she said. a spokesman for the accord said negotiations over payments and even legal action would not hold up its work to improve safety in factories.however, pressure on the accord to contribute to the payment of displaced workers has ratcheted up after a rival factory-safety group backed by us retailers including walmart and gap, the alliance for bangladesh worker safety, set aside $5m to help pay factory workers for up to two months while work is carried out on the buildings it has identified as needing improvement. it has, so far, identified five factories in four buildings where production needed to be suspended.“the alliance is sharing the workers’ salary along with entrepreneurs so now there is a big confusion. we had a big meeting with the accord to make them understand they have to come forward or how will we help our workers?” said shaidullah azim, a director of the bangladeshi garment manufacturers and exporters association.
advanced	we may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm back to the future ii, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched. experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally altering the transportation landscape. òitõs a very dynamic time,ó said robert puentes, of the brookings institutionõs metropolitan policy program think- tank. òthereõs a focus on a tighter connection between the role of transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people.óas the average us commute lengthens and the countryõs infrastructure ages badly, cities across the us are being forced to rede ne what transportation is. increasingly, urban planners, transportation experts and scientists are realizing that old auto-centric models focused on easing traf c congestion arenõt enough to tackle issues like population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now, more than ever, an integral component of a cityõs larger sustainability efforts.big us cities like los angeles, seattle and chicago are working to make better use of their streets by adding more bus lanes, augmenting pedestrian walkways and expanding their rail options, while at the same time working with the private sector on advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment, essentially making transportation intelligent. òthe most sustainable places to live are those places that have multi-modal transport systems,ó puentes said. òyou canõt be a global competitive city if you donõt have a robust transportation network.óhere are three of the key trends that experts predict will shape the transportation industry over the coming years. connectivity the rise of ride-sharing services like uber and lyft ð essentially taxis booked at the click of a smartphone button ð and apps like waze, which uses real-time traf c data to  nd the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people get around and affecting the very way in which traf c moves through a city. communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era, according to allan clelland, an expert on transportation technology.according to a recent study from the uclaõs institute of transportation studies, vehicle travel has declined among millennials ð individuals born roughly between the early 1980s and early 2000s ð compared to previous generations. according to the study, those born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives.meanwhile, those still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to waze. experts say the traf c app has eased congestion on motorways and reduced travel times for drivers but also led to a problematic rise in cars moving through residential neighbourhoods. this has angered residents, who claim the increased traf c on their quiet roads reduces their quality of life.this trend could continue as vehicle-to-vehicle data communication, as well as communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure, grows. currently, a traf c light can detect when a car is approaching but thatõs about it. companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.automation driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. however, the partial automation of cars is already underway. alexandre bayen of the university of california expects automation will progress in stages:  rst, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: essentially, vehicles that are connected electronically and travel in single  le.the idea of a fully automated transportation system is intriguing because it has the potential to improve safety by removing human error and increase the ef ciency of car owners, who can get on with other tasks during a long commute. it can also help reduce carbon emissions and traf c congestion and allow more people access to cars. but, even if driverless technology were ready to hit the roads now, it would take a long time to get fully automated given the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.to see what driverless cars might look like in action, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.environmental concern as the world races to avoid catastrophic climate change, and countries, states and cities work to meet ambitious emissions goals, these policies could also have a big impact on the future of transportation, spurring everything from zero- and low-emission vehicles to apps that encourage more walking, biking and carpooling.sharon feigon, executive director of the shared use mobility center, envisages a future where a person can use a transit pass that gives them access to numerous modes of transport in a given day. if their train is delayed, for instance, they can access a city bike, take a shuttle or rent a vehicle through a car share programme using the same pass. òweõre going to see these systems packaged together and make it as easy as possible to connect them up with each other so people can transfer seamlessly between them,ó she said.when considering the future of transportation, itõs also important to keep in mind why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. technologies and trends that reduce the need for those trips ð say, virtual

advanced	europe is to become the first place in the world to force ‘real-world’ emissions tests on car makers, opening up a new front in the fight to tackle air pollution. new regulations will introduce the tests to reveal what cars’ emissions are like when driving on roads and in traffic rather than in ideal, laboratory-like conditions, as is currently the case.green lit by european commission vice president, frans timmermans, the tests are designed to enforce a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre, a level met by only one car out of 16, according to researchers. other countries, such as china and korea, which are also considering real-world emissions tests, will be watching what happens next closely.pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and particulates are thought to be responsible for at least one quarter of the 29,000 annual pollution-related deaths in the uk alone. that figure is likely to rise, when the committee on the medical effects of air pollutants publishes what it calls “strengthening evidence” of damage to public health from nitrogen oxide emissions later in 2015.but the current ‘new european drive cycle’ laboratory test for measuring these emissions is a quarter of a century old and has been outpaced by technological developments in the car industry. studies have shown that the results of lab techniques to measure car emissions can easily be fixed by using techniques such as taping up doors and windows to minimize air resistance, driving on unrealistically smooth roads and testing at improbably high temperatures. campaigners say that car makers also use tricks such as programming vehicles to go into a low emissions mode when their front wheels are spinning and their back wheels are stationary, as happens in such lab experiments.“the commission is finalizing a proposal to introduce a new emissions testing procedure that will allow proper assessment of the vehicles in real driving,” said lucia caudet, a commission spokesperson. the proposal still needs approval from other commissioners and a technical committee but “we don’t expect any major internal hurdles,” a european union (eu) source added.“one key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 citizens annually is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars, causing many times more pollution on the road,” said greg archer, the clean vehicles manager for transport and environment. “the development of a new, real-world driving emission test is an important step forward in tackling urban air pollution. eu states should now support the commission’s proposals and ignore the whingeing from car makers that the rules are too tough.”according to research by the international council on clean transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg/km standard, with some models running at 22 times above the recommended limit. only one car out of 16 met the 80g target. around one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport – mostly diesel – and, in urban areas, concentrations can rise as high as 64%, european environment agency figures indicate.campaigners say that the car industry has tried to delay reforms to car test cycles but industry groups deny this, arguing that a five-year lead-time is necessary for technical and economic reasons. “real driving emissions (rde) is a totally new regulation that will force significant emission control hardware changes that may be demanded in the middle of a vehicle’s production lifetime,” said cara mclaughlin, a spokesperson for the european automobile manufacturers association (acea). “however, acea fully accepts that rde will apply to new types of cars from september 2017.”in an unusual move, the car association sent timmermans a draft regulation of their own for him to consider, after eu representatives finally agreed a regulation to implement the nitrogen oxide limits with beefed-up road trials and strict monitoring of exhaust fumes. acea’s draft regulation would have covered fewer pollutants and further delayed the regulation’s phased introduction until 2020. test distances would have been shortened from 1,300m to below 700m, minimum temperatures would have been raised from -7c to -3c and more rural roads would have been used. “the lobbyists were all over this,” archer said. “this was a real attempt at subversion of the legislative process.”after timmerman’s apparent rejection of the acea proposal, the regulation will now pass to commissioners for a rubber stamp, and member states for final amendments, before an expected introduction in september. by 2017, the first real-world car emissions tests are expected to begin in earnest. with a similar battle already looming over the testing of co2 emissions for cars at the end of 2015 – and with comparable debates in other countries – the introduction of the eu’s new emissions tests will be watched closely.
advanced	our new international survey across 33 countries shows just how wrong the world is about a range of key social realities.british people think the top 1% wealthiest households own 59% of their countryõs wealth, when they actually òonlyó own 23%. americans think that 33% of their population are immigrants, when in fact it is only 14%.brazilians think the average age in their country is 56, when it is only 31. russians think that 31% of their politicians are women, when it is only 14%.in britain, people think that an extraordinary 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%. in india, the online population think 60% of the whole country also has internet access, when in fact only 19% do.why are people across the world so often so clueless about these realities?it is partly that we just struggle with basic maths and some of us clearly misunderstand the questions or interpret them differently. for example, most countries hugely overestimate how many people do not af liate themselves with a religion: across the 33 countries, 37% do not, according to respondents, but the average is actually just 18%. this will be partly because we will be thinking of how many people practise their religion, rather than what they put on census forms. people also take mental shortcuts, where they grab for easily available information even if it doesnõt quite  t the question. our huge overestimates of the rural populations in most countries will be affected by how much of the physical landmass rural areas make up, rather than a careful calculation of how unoccupied it generally is. in daniel kahnemanõs terms, answers to these sorts of questions are classic examples of òfastó thinking, rather than òslowó.we are tied to our own perspective and struggle to imagine the variety in our countries, as highlighted by our indian sampleõs massively overestimating their populationõs access to the internet. our study was mostly carried out through an online survey ð and, in developing countries, this will be representative of a more af uent, connected group rather than the population as a whole. in some ways, we may have expected this more educated sample to get closer to reality ð those with higher education levels tend to be more accurate on these types of questions. but what we  nd, throughout the study, is that people grossly generalize from their own situations, forgetting how unrepresentative they are.we suffer from what social psychologists call òemotional innumeracyó when estimating realities: this means we are sending a message about what is worrying us as much as trying to get the right answers. cause and effect run both ways, with our concern leading to our misperceptions as much as our misperceptions creating our concern.for britain, this is likely to be part of the explanation for peopleõs huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own, how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when it is really only 13%, according to of cial estimates). people are worried about the concentration of wealth, the housing pressures facing young people and immigration levels, and this is re ected in them overstating the scale of the issues. but, the survey suggests there are also some issues where people are not as worried as they should be. for example, most countries hugely underestimate how much of their population is overweight or obese. the worst case is saudi arabia, where people think only 28% are, when 71% are. britons think it is 44%, when it is actually nearly half as much again ð 62% are either overweight or obese.and, in many ways, it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study. the top 1% in russia own 70% of the nationõs wealth, while the top 1% in new zealand only own 18%. half of italians aged 25-34 still live with their parents, when it is only 4% in norway. the average age in india is 27; it is 47 in japan. only 10% of politicians are women in brazil, hungary and japan, when 44% are in sweden. when the reality is so strange and varied, it is no wonder weõre so wrong.
advanced	margaret thatcher, the most dominant british prime minister since winston churchill in 1940 and a global champion of the late 20th-century free market economic revival, has died. the british government announced that she would receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours at st paul’s cathedral.the british prime minister, david cameron, who is cutting short his trip to europe to return to london following the news, said: “it was with great sadness that l learned of lady thatcher’s death. we’ve lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great briton.” he added: “as our first woman prime minister, margaret thatcher succeeded against all the odds, and the real thing about margaret thatcher is that she didn’t just lead our country, she saved our country, and i believe she will go down as the greatest british peacetime prime minister.”in a statement, president barack obama said, “here in america, many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with president reagan, reminding the world that we are not simply carried along by the currents of history – we can shape them with moral conviction, unyielding courage and iron will.”the first woman elected to lead a major western state, lady thatcher, as she became after the longest premiership since 1827, served 11 unbroken years at no 10 downing street.thatcher, who was 87, had been in declining health for some years, suffering from dementia. after a series of mini-strokes in 2002, thatcher withdrew from public life, no longer able to make the kind of waspish pronouncements that had been her forte in office – and beyond.her death was greeted with tributes from across the political spectrum.as labour sources announced the party would suspend campaigning in local elections as a mark of respect, its leader, ed miliband, said: “she will be remembered as a unique figure. she reshaped the politics of a whole generation. she was britain’s first woman prime minister. she moved the centre ground of british politics and was a huge figure on the world stage. the labour party disagreed with much of what she did and she will always remain a controversial figure. but we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength.”the deputy prime minister, nick clegg, said: “margaret thatcher was one of the defining figures in modern british politics. whatever side of the political debate you stand on, no one can deny that as prime minister she left a unique and lasting imprint on the country she served.”describing her as a political phenomenon, the former tory prime minister sir john major said: “her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.”the “iron lady” proved a significant cold war ally of the us president ronald reagan in the final showdown with the soviet union, which broke up under reformist pressures led by mikhail gorbachev, a kremlin leader with whom thatcher famously declared she could “do business”. as a result, many ordinary voters in ex-soviet bloc states saw her as a bold champion of their liberty, a view widely shared across the spectrum of mainstream us opinion – though not at home or among key eu partners.thatcher was an unremarkable mid-ranking conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975. within a decade, she had become known around the world – both admired and detested – for her pro-market domestic reforms and her implacable attitudes in foreign policy, including her long-running battle with the ira, which almost managed to murder her when it placed a bomb in the grand hotel, brighton, in 1984.at home, the emerging doctrine of thatcherism meant denationalization of state-owned industry – the new word “privatization” came into widespread use in many countries – and defeat of militant trade unionists, notably the national union of miners, whose year-long strike (1984– 85) was bitter and traumatic.boosted by the newly arrived revenues from britain’s north sea oil fields, thatcher had room to manoeuvre and change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies – including moderate members of her own party.but she also deployed her notorious “handbaggings”, or verbal attacks, in the european union to obtain a british rebate – “my money” as she called it. she was less successful in fending off the centralizing ambitions of the “belgian empire”, her description of the european commission, especially in the years when it was headed by the french socialist jacques delors.her allies in the tabloid press egged her on. and, as the british economy recovered from the severe recession that her monetarist medicine had inflicted on it – to tame the unions and cure inflation – she briefly seemed invincible.but untrammelled power, with the defeat or retirement of allies who had kept her in check, led to mistakes and growing unpopularity. when sir geoffrey howe, nominally her deputy, finally fell out with thatcher – chiefly over europe – his devastating resignation speech triggered a leadership challenge. thatcher made way for john major rather than risk losing to him in a ballot.in retirement, she wrote highly successful memoirs in two volumes and campaigned energetically on behalf of the thatcher foundation, which sought to promote her values around the world.
advanced	seaworld has suffered an 84% collapse in pro ts as customers have deserted the controversial aquatic theme park company following claims it mistreated orca whales.the company, which trains dolphins and killer whales to perform tricks in front of stadiums full of spectators, has reported declines in attendance, sales and pro ts because of òcontinued brand challengesó.seaworld has been in the headlines since the 2013 documentary black sh detailed claims that its treatment of orca whales provoked violent behaviour, contributing to the deaths of three people. following the release of the documentary, attendance collapsed, the company lost more than half of its market value on wall street and its former ceo was forced out.the company has since launched a nationwide marketing campaign to combat animal rights activists claims that, among other things, captive orcas die at a younger age than their wild counterparts.despite cutting ticket prices and spending $10m on the marketing blitz, which features its veterinarians caring for whales, seaworld ceo joel manby was forced to admit that the company is still struggling to convince the public that it treats its whales well.òwe realize we have much work ahead of us to recover more of our attendance base, increase revenue and improve our performance, as returning to historical performance levels will take time and investment,ó manby said. òon the reputation side, early feedback on our campaign has been positive. however, we recognize that fully resolving our brand challenges in california will require sustained focus and commitment to correct misinformation.óòwe will continue to  ght with the facts because the facts are on our side,ó he said recently on a conference call with journalists and analysts. manby, who joined the company as ceo in 2015 to help the company rehabilitate itself, said he would set out his vision for the future of the company at a special event on 6 november.already in the pipeline are plans for a new shark exhibition in orlando and an attraction in san antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a ònaturalisticó setting.the companyõs  nancial report, released on 6 august, showed net income in the second quarter dropped from $37.4m in 2014 to $5.8m in 2015, an 84% decrease. revenue fell from $405m to $392m. attendance dropped by more than 100,000 from 6.58 million to 6.48 million.analysts will now be closely watching seaworldõs sales and attendance numbers in the third quarter, which is traditionally the companyõs most pro table and covers the summer holiday season. attendance may suffer from a fresh scandal in july 2015, in which a seaworld employee was alleged to have in ltrated animal rights protest groups against the company.jared goodman, director of animal law for people for the ethical treatment of animals (peta), which has been leading campaigns against seaworld, said: òseaworld is in the midst of a spying scandal, animals are dying in its tanks and tens of thousands of people have opposed its bid to build a new orca prison so it should come as no surprise that seaworldõs quarterly earnings have plummeted yet again in the second quarter. families just donõt want to buy tickets to see orcas going insane inside tiny tanks and seaworldõs pro ts, like the orcas, wonõt recover until the abusement park empties its tanks and builds coastal sanctuaries.óseaworldõs shares, which were worth $39 in 2013, were changing hands for just under $18 in august 2015.
