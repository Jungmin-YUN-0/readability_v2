intermediate	swedish prisons have long had a reputation around the world for being progressive. but are the country’s prisons a soft option?the head of sweden’s prison and probation service, nils oberg, said in november 2013 that four swedish prisons will close due to an “out of the ordinary” fall in prisoner numbers.although there has been no fall in crime rates, between 2011 and 2012 there was a 6% fall in sweden’s prisoner population, now a little over 4,500. a similar decrease is expected in 2013 and 2014. oberg said he was puzzled by the unexpected fall, but hoped that the reason was to do with how his prisons are run. “we certainly hope that the efforts we put into rehabilitation and preventing criminals from reoffending has made a difference,” he said.“the modern prison service in sweden is very different from when i joined as a young prison officer in 1978,” says kenneth gustafsson, governor of kumla prison, sweden’s most secure jail, 130 miles west of stockholm. however, he doesn’t think the system has gone soft. “when i joined, the focus was very much on humanity in prisons. prisoners were treated well – maybe too well, some might say. but, after a number of escapes in 2004, we had to place more emphasis on security.”the swedes still have a humane approach to sentencing, even of the most serious offenders: jail sentences are not usually more than ten years. those who receive life imprisonment can still apply to the courts after a decade to have the sentence changed to a fixed sentence, usually between 18 and 25 years. sweden was the first country in europe to introduce the electronic tagging of convicted criminals and continues to keep prison sentences short wherever possible by using community-based measures. these have been effective at stopping criminals from reoffending.the overall reoffending rate in sweden is between 30 and 40% over three years – to compare that with another european country, the number is around half that of the uk. one thing that has kept reoffending down and the number of prisoners in sweden below 70 per 100,000 people is that the age of criminal responsibility is 15. in the uk, for example, children aged ten to 17 and young people under the age of 21 have the highest reoffending rates. in sweden, no young person under the age of 21 can be sentenced to life – this is not the case in many other countries – and they try to keep young offenders out of prison.one strong reason for the fall in prison numbers might be the amount of post-prison support available in sweden. a government-run probation service supervises people on probation and provides treatment programmes for offenders with drug, alcohol or violence problems. the service is helped by around 4,500 members of the public who volunteer to befriend and support offenders under supervision.i spoke to a former prisoner who now runs a group called x-cons sweden. peter soderlund served almost three years of a four-year sentence for drug and weapons offences before he was released in 1998. he was helped by an organization run by other former prisoners called kris (criminals’ return into society).both organizations work with the same goal: helping prisoners successfully fit back into society after they have been released. and what is life like for the prisoner in sweden? “when i was inside, i was lucky.” says soderlund. “in osteraker prison, where i served my sentence, we were treated well. but i knew that not all swedish prisons were like that. i met so many people in there who needed help – after i received help from kris, i knew i wanted to help others. with x-cons, we meet them at the prison gate and support them into accommodation and offer a network of support.”“in sweden, we believe very much in the idea of rehabilitation,” says gustafsson. “of course, there are some people who will not or cannot change. but, in my experience, the majority of prisoners want to change and we must do what we can to help them.”nannan
intermediate	the customer next to you in the queue looks quite normal. but, instead of a shopping list, you notice sheõs carrying handwritten notes about the appearance and cleanliness of the store. sheõs been timing the speed of the queue on her phone ... and is that a tiny camera lens in her purse? sheõs probably a mystery shopper.there are approximately 50,000 mystery shopping trips carried out every month in the uk, according to the mystery shopping providers association, and, as more and more spending takes place online, the demand for mystery shoppers is growing. òretailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who are prepared to set foot in a physical store want a service and an experience they canõt get online,ó says simon boydell, spokesman for marketforce, which has more than 300,000 mystery shoppers. òour clients want to measure how well their stores are delivering on that experience.óòwe assign different store locations to each shopper and rotate them so that they never go back to the same shop within three months,ó says jill spencer of mystery shopping company aba. òeach day, they typically spend up to eight hours visiting  ve to ten stores, plus another hour or two  ling detailed reports on every aspect of their visit.ó for that, the mystery shoppers can earn up to £155 a day. they are also reimbursed for their expenses. mystery shoppers who  lm their visits with a hidden camera can earn even more ð around £300 a day.shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy. òiõm typically given between £5 and £20 to spend at each store, to assess the service i receive at the till,ó says mystery shopper laura. òiõm always given a scenario, such as buying something from a speci c department or a new product range, but i can often buy whatever i want ð and keep it.ólike most full-time mystery shoppers, laura is self-employed. her income is around £30,000 to £40,000 a year and that doesnõt include all the freebies she gets on the job. òwith the perks, itõs enough to live on.ó she  nds it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved. òi know it must be because of my feedback or why would they pay me to give it? some of the retailers i shop at win awards for customer service and i think that is down to us mystery shoppers. i feel iõm not just doing a service for my company; iõm doing a service for all shoppers everywhere.óitõs estimated that more than 500,000 people have registered as mystery shoppers in the uk, but just 10% or less manage to get regular work each month. this has led to a dramatic reduction in pay. òonce you got a fee, reimbursement for your purchase and mileage, but you now often just receive a contribution towards a purchase,ó say val, a 51-year-old former mystery shopper. òi worked for 40 different mystery shopping companies for almost 20 years but i gave up entirely three years ago because i had bills to pay and very few assignments paid an acceptable rate.ónowadays, mystery shopping companies mostly give freebies to incentivize their workers. òmarketforce shoppers typically get a couple of pounds for a visit as a token gesture for their time and effort,ó says boydell. òat the most, weõll pay £15 to £25 plus reimbursement for, perhaps, a meal for two or a hotel stay. we donõt directly employ any shoppers so we donõt have to pay them the minimum wage.óòiõd go on a cruise for nothing,ó says laura. òbut i think mystery shopping companies that pay you a nominal fee to travel to a restaurant and eat a meal are exploiting people. i wonõt touch those jobs anymore.ó there are plenty of people, however, that would. hannah, a 41-year-old lawyer, has done nearly 500 visits for the mystery dining company in her spare time without receiving 9 3 pay or travel expenses. she carries out their most exclusive assignments, enjoying £200 meals at michelin-starred restaurants and overnight stays at boutique hotels.but thereõs no such thing as a free lunch, even if you work for a mystery dining company. hannah says she typically spends two to four hours after each visit writing detailed reports on everything from the quality of the food to speci c interactions with staff, whom she always needs to be able to name or describe. she has to memorize all these details while eating her meal because she cannot openly write anything down.òthereõs lots to remember. youõre expected to give feedback while itõs fresh, so iõve had to get up at 5am to write a report before work. itõs a challenging thing to do; you need to be focused, articulate and detail orientated.ónannan
intermediate	it was a beautiful summer evening and i decided to go for a swim off doolin pier in county clare, ireland, where i moved in 2012. there was a woman in the water with dusty, a dolphin who has a great relationship with a group of people she regularly swims with. dusty arrived in doolin in about 2008 and hundreds of people have swum with her since, giving the impression that she’s totally tame.that evening, the woman was tickling dusty’s tummy and it just looked so inviting. there were about 20 tourists and locals on the pier, looking at this lovely spectacle. just after i got into the water, dusty left the woman she was with and went crazy – i found out afterwards that she’s very territorial when she is with somebody. her tail was flapping wildly and, at first, i thought it was a display but, then, i realized she was angry. i knew i had to get out of the water so i swam towards the pier but, within seconds, dusty had crashed into me with her snout. it was very powerful and painful, and the speed was amazing. i was pushed forwards violently.all the people on the pier were staring down at me open-mouthed. dusty was still in the water beside me, her tail flapping crazily. that was more frightening than anything: i thought, if she hits me with her tail, i could go under and drown.i was at the pier but couldn’t get out because of my injuries. i felt pure terror. i shouted for help and a guy put his arm in and pulled me out on to the steps. then, another man appeared and said he was an orthopaedic surgeon. he had been driving into doolin when he saw what was happening on the pier. i was so cold and very worried – i didn’t know how bad my injuries were and my biggest fear was internal bleeding. he checked me over and said he couldn’t feel any evidence of bleeding but that i probably had broken bones. i found out later that i had six spinal fractures, three broken ribs and a damaged lung.i was in hospital for five days and off work for five months with limited mobility and pain. then, i was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress. my near-death experience had left me anxious about everything. i felt that people were looking at me in the wrong way, i began to struggle with loud noises and i suffered from memory loss. three months before the accident, i had opened a health-food shop but i had to let it go because i could no longer work.it was the hardest year ever but, now, it’s all behind me. i had therapy, osteopathy and massage, and am building up my own osteopathy practice now. i have a new empathy with patients because i have been one.i am grateful that i am healthy and i really want to prevent other people being injured. we have this lovely idea about dolphins and have faith in them – who would think a dolphin would ever attack a person? if you see a fierce animal coming towards you with its teeth bared, it’s scary, but dolphins have this lovely, wide smile.i don’t have any anger towards dusty. i respect her. but i was in her territory and she’s a wild, unpredictable animal. people need to know that. so many come here to swim with her and they don’t understand how dangerous it can be. several other people were injured that summer.after the man pulled me out of the water, dusty swam away but, then, she came back and was looking at me. our eyes met and i felt there was complete remorse in her. she was a totally different dolphin; the anger had gone. the people on the pier were in awe. when she had that little moment with me, that was the end of the terror. i made my peace with her.
intermediate	they may not know who steve jobs was or even how to tie their own shoelaces, but the average six-year-old child understands more about digital technology than a 45-year-old adult, according to a new report.the arrival of broadband in the year 2000 has created a generation of digital natives, ofcom (which checks standards in the uk communications industries) says in its annual study of british consumers. born in the new millennium, these children are learning how to operate smartphones or tablets before they are able to talk.òthese younger people are shaping communications,ó said jane rumble, who is head of media research at ofcom. òas a result of growing up in the digital age, they are developing completely different communication habits from older generations, even compared to the 16-to-24 age group.ó800 children and 2,000 adults took ofcomõs òdigital quotientó, or dq, test, which attempts to gauge awareness of and self-con dence around gadgets from tablets to smart watches, knowledge of superfast internet, 4g mobile- phone networks and mobile apps.among 6- to 7-year-olds, who have grown up with youtube, spotify music streaming and online television, the average dq score was 98, higher than for those aged between 45 and 49, who scored an average of 96. digital understanding peaks between 14 and 15 years old, with a dq of 113, and then drops gradually throughout adulthood, before falling rapidly in old age.people can now test their digital knowledge with a short version of the questionnaire that will give anyone a dq score, along with advice on how to improve their understanding and protect themselves and their families online.the ways in which millennial children contact each other and consume entertainment are so different from previous generations that forecasters now believe their preferences to be a better indication of the future than the preferences of trendsetting young adults.the most remarkable change is in time spent talking by phone. two decades ago, teenagers spent their evenings monopolizing the home telephone line, talking about love affairs and friendships in conversations that lasted for hours.for those aged 12 to 15, phone calls account for just 3% of time spent communicating through any device. for all adults, this rises to 20% and, for young adults, it is still three times as high at 9%. todayõs children do the majority of their remote socializing by sending written messages or through shared photographs and videos. òthe millennium generation is losing its voice,ó ofcom claims.over 90% of their device-time is message based, chatting on social networks like facebook, sending instant messages through services like whatsapp or even sending traditional mobile- phone text messages. just 2% of childrenõs time using devices is spent emailing, compared to 33% for adults.away from their phones, 12- to 15-year-olds have a very different relationship with other media, too. a digital seven-day diary shows live television accounts for just half of viewing for this age group, compared to nearly 70% for all adults. they spend 20% of their time viewing short video clips, for example on youtube, or news clips on facebook and other social sites. the rest of their viewing is shared between dvds, streamed content through net ix or itunes and recorded television programmes.young adults aged 16 to 24 are big media consumers. however, they consume hardly any live radio or print-based media.younger people are also moving away from live television and moving to streaming and catch- up services. even among adults, television is becoming less important. television viewing among 16- to 24-year-olds has been dipping each year since 2010, but 2013 was the  rst year that researchers found that viewing fell in all age groups. the theory is that easy-to-use tablet computers with large screens have brought many older people online.nannan
intermediate	the age of the big british summer music festival, including glastonbury, is drawing to a close, according to the leading rock promoter and manager harvey goldsmith.goldsmith has produced and worked with most of the western worldõs biggest music stars, from the who, the rolling stones and queen to madonna, bob dylan and luciano pavarotti. he says the biggest problem is a serious lack of major new bands to follow on from the old ones.òthe age of the festival peaked about two years ago,ó he said, speaking at the hay festival of literature and arts in wales. òthere are too many festivals and there are not enough big acts to headline them. that is a big, big problem in our industry. and we are not producing a new generation of these kind of acts ð like the rolling stones, muse, even the arctic monkeys ð that can headline.óthere were about 900 music festival events in the uk between may and september 2014, he said, and there is no way they can all continue. òthere is going to be a growth in events where it isnõt just music but with poetry or books or magic shows. there will be lots of small combination festivals that give something extra ð not people standing around in a big  eld unable to go to the toilet because they might miss the band.óclearly, the way music is delivered has changed, he said. òpeople donõt seem to want to listen to an album any more. and, most rock bands built their reputation on albums ð they might take three albums to become really good at their art, to become great, but young people donõt want that.ógoldsmith, 69, also revealed that he is working with robin de levita, the dutch producer of the whoõs 1970s rock musical tommy, at a new 1,100-seat theatre in wembley, london, where the  rst stage adaptation of the teen book and movie series the hunger games will be performed in june 2016.talking at hay, goldsmith also revealed some of the secrets from his long career in the music industry. he said that keith moon put dynamite down a sydney hotel room toilet to unblock it. and, he said that john lennon had stage fright just before an appearance at madison square garden in 1974 ð he was pulled, vomiting, out of his dressing room and pushed out on stage. òitõs bizarre how common that is among artists. itõs odd how afraid they get but, as soon as the  rst chord is hit, theyõre  ne,ó he said.he also gave the answer to a long-running rock õnõ roll mystery: why elvis presley never performed outside north america. presleyõs long-time manager, colonel tom parker, admitted to him, he said, that the real reason why goldsmithõs attempts to bring the singer to london had failed was parkerõs own uncertain immigration status.òhe explained that it was because he was an illegal dutch immigrant. he didnõt want to risk leaving the us ð it was him, not elvis,ó said goldsmith.and, his ultimate rock õnõ roll performer? òfreddie mercury had to be our most powerful stage performer, the best live performer weõve ever had. at live aid, he went out and saw that audience and just grabbed it.óbut, nobody has found the next queen yet, he said. òweõre not producing a new generation of this kind of act. coldplay is probably the last one and that was ten years ago. òso, with no big acts to headline, there are no big shows. glastonbury has got to the point where it canõt  nd any more big acts and thatõs the pinnacle of the festivals. they are really over.ó nannan
intermediate	angry waiters are asking for public support in a battle to keep their tips. pizzaexpress branches are to be targeted by protesters, in an attempt to get the restaurant chain to stop taking a proportion of tips for staff that have been paid on credit and debit cards. campaigners have also started an online petition in the hope that restaurant-goers will support their demands.pizzaexpress keeps, as an admin fee, 8p out of every £1 paid when tips are given by card. this is a policy that has made some employees angry. the chain, which has 430 branches around the uk and is particularly popular with families, makes around £1m a year from the practice, according to the union unite.òwe believe this 8% fee is unfair and that, if the chain values its staff, it should be paying them the total tips they are given by customers,ó said chantal chegrinec of unite. òwe are starting with pizzaexpress but they are not the only ones and we will turn our attention to other companies after this.óthe protests are being organized by local branches of unite. the  rst is taking place at the british museum branch of pizzaexpress in london. the union has also written to the restaurant chainõs ceo. unite began the campaign following a survey of its pizzaexpress members after the chain was sold to a chinese company in 2014. one of the top issues was the 8% deduction from their tips.one disgruntled pizzaexpress employee, who wants to remain anonymous, said that the admin fee was costing her £3 a night. òi have worked at pizzaexpress for 15 years,ó she said in a letter to unite. òafter all this time, iõm still only paid the national minimum wage of £6.50 an hour. so you see my colleagues and i are very reliant on customer tips to top up our low wages. i work hard and am good at my job but, when pizzaexpress thinks it can get away with taking a percentage of our hard-earned tips left on a card, i get upset.óask and zizzi, two other restaurant chains, also deduct 8% of the tips paid by card. but other chains deduct even more. cafe_ rouge, bella italia and belgo deduct 10%; so do strada and giraffe.a spokesperson for pizzaexpress said that its admin charge was to cover the cost of running a òtroncó ð a pay arrangement used to distribute tips among staff. òwe made big efforts to set up this tronc system, which is run by staff. they independently decide how tips made by electronic card payment are distributed between the restaurant teams; it is a system run by employees for the employees,ó she said.the chain, which sells 29m pizzas a year in its uk restaurants, denied that it pro ts from the admin fee. but other restaurant groups do not deduct an admin fee from tips. wagamama, pizza hut and tgi friday all take nothing. frankie & bennyõs, chiquitos and garfunkels used to charge 10% but they stopped doing this several years ago.unite recently targeted ten pizzaexpress restaurants in south london ð they distributed lea ets to customers who were òshocked and disgustedó by the practice. pizzaexpress says the charge is mentioned in small print at the bottom of its menus. but the employee who wrote to unite said that, when she mentioned the charge to customers, they were always surprised. most customers would then pay the tip in cash. almost 6,000 people have signed uniteõs online petition.one waiter, who doesnõt work for pizzaexpress but has worked for 11 years for another restaurant chain, said that at least a third of his income is from tips. he doesnõt want to be identi ed because he is scared there will be reprisals. òi work in a busy london branch and, on an average night, i serve 150 people and earn £40 to £50 in tips,ó he says. òthat might sound like a lot but that money is crucial to me because my basic pay is only £6.50 an hour.óconservative mp andrew percy has asked for a change in the law that would give restaurant staff more control over tips. he said he plans to raise the issue in parliament.ó
intermediate	two mothers in south africa have found out that they are raising each otherõs daughters after they were mistakenly switched at birth in a hospital in 2010.but, while one of the women wants to correct the error and get her biological child back, the other is refusing to give back the girl she has raised as her own.henk strydom, a lawyer for one of the mothers, described the swap as a travesty and tragedy that is unlikely to have a happy ending.both mothers gave birth at the tambo memorial hospital in boksburg, east of johannesburg, on the same day in 2010. ònobody suspected anything,ó strydom said.but, in 2013, one of the mothers, who is 33 and unemployed, sued her ex-partner for maintenance for her daughter. strydom said: òthe man denied he was the father. a dna test was done and it was found it was not his baby and not her baby. she was devastated. she didnõt know what to do.óeventually, she met the other mother and, since december 2013, they have been attending joint counselling sessions, arranged by the hospital. here they have met their biological daughtersstrydom said of his client: òshe said there are resemblances to herself. she told me that it was traumatic. you can see itõs not easy for her. she has to care for a child that is not hers on her own while her child is with someone else.óthe woman became unhappy with the process and asked the childrenõs court to give her custody of her biological child, but the other mother refused.òitõs a tragedy. she wants the baby back, but itõs four years later: you can understand that the other mother doesnõt want to give up her baby,ó strydom said.the high court in pretoria has asked the university of pretoriaõs centre for child law to investigate what will now be in the best interests of the children.strydom added: òi donõt know what the court will decide. your guess is as good as mine. but, whatever happens, someone wonõt be happy.óhe said, at this point, he and his client do not want to sue the hospital or government health department, which is helping with the case and providing counselling.the centre for child law will interview the mothers and fathers, as well as any other person with a òsignificant relationshipó with either of the girls. the children and mothers will have clinical assessments and may be seen by a psychologist.karabo ngidi, a lawyer with the centre, said: òwhatõs going to happen must be in the best interests of the children. biology is an important aspect but not the only one.ó the families are of zulu ethnicity and so zulu tradition, culture and customary law will be a factor, she added. it is also still possible the ex- partner of the mother who is taking legal action could be the biological father of the girl who was switched.it is not the first child-swap case in south africa. in 1995, two mothers were awarded damages after their sons, born in 1989, were accidentally switched at the johannesburg hospital where they were born.in 2009, in oregon in the united states, dee ann angell and kay rene reed discovered that they had been mistakenly mixed up at birth in 1953 when a nurse brought them back from bathing.in 2013, in japan, a 60-year-old man swapped at birth from his rich parents to a poor family was given compensation. he grew up on welfare and became a truck driver, whereas his biological brothers and sisters ð and the boy brought up in his place ð attended private secondary schools and universities.bruce laing, a clinical psychologist in johannesburg, said the long-term effects of a baby swap could be òprofoundó, òterrifyingó and òincredibly traumatizingó. he told the times of south africa: òthe parents might always be thinking ôwhat if?õó
intermediate	will we soon live in a world where drones deliver packages? if you believe amazon, the answer is òyesó. others are not so sure: we need to make more technical progress in this area but there is also the problem of public safety.amazon spokesman paul misener told a us congress hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place. the federal aviation authority (faa) will  nally have regulations on the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by june 2016. but the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines arenõt legal yet ð only drones up to 25kg will be legal. and the faa says that, if youõre going to crowd the skies with radio- controlled  ying robots, they must all use different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack.professor sajiv singh, who runs a cargo delivery company called nearearth, said that, to pilot a state-of-the-art drone, you simply give it some basic instructions: go to this altitude, perform this short task, go back home. but even short  ights from a mobile landing pad could cause serious logistical problems, he said.òtheyõre not going to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; theyõre going to deliver from a warehouse to the consumer, which will probably be an urban area or a suburban area,ó he said. òin those particular cases, there are going to be hazards that the vehicle is going to have to see. maybe there will be terrain that the map doesnõt know about. then, maybe thereõs construction equipment that wasnõt there before but is there now. maybe gps signals are blocked, in which case itõs going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.ó all these problems can be solved, he said ð but itõs dif cult.one major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks. òif you have an off-the-shelf uav [unmanned aerial vehicle], itõll just keep going and crash into the ground,ó said roboticist daniel huber.furthermore, òyou canõt do everything with a 25kg aircraftó, said jay mcconville, director of business development for unmanned systems at lockheed martin. òpeople in the aircraft business have to remind ourselves that the operator doesnõt really care about every little thing about the aircraft and wants instead to focus on the end result,ó he said. òoperators want to see vehicle status information; they want to see video on their handheld device or their laptop.óòtechnologically, most of the things that we need for this are in place,ó said huber. he is working on a program to allow drones to inspect infrastructure ð pipelines, telephone lines, bridges and so on. òweõve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and it will  y around that area and look at every surface and then report back.óhuber, who works on 3d systems imagery, said about amazon: òi have heard them say that many packages are lightweight ð a drone can carry a kilogram for 15 minutes. if you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood, it can deliver from that base. you need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have that distance.ó itõs one way, he said, of making sure the surrounding population is relatively safe. òthe larger you get, the more dangerous you get.óproblems with the use of drones can be solved in some very dramatic ways, huber said. at a recent conference, he said, a disaster relief drone company demonstrated a robot that could take off and, when it got tired, land on its own charging station and exchange its batteries.of course, safety is still a major concern ð singh says that, for a commercial aircraft to be allowed to  y, it has to prove a rate of one serious failure every one million hours. drones, he said, are a long way from that. òthe reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours,ó singh said. but they donõt consider an oil leak a catastrophic failure ð something has to fall out of the sky.part of the reason for this is that air travel is dangerous so standards are much higher. òif you  y commercial airlines, they often say, ôoh, a component has failed ð we have to go back to the gate,õó singh said. òand thatõs an established industry with 60 years of legacy! i hate to think that a drone might come down on a busy road.ó part of the solution, singh said, is planning for every situation: òif things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.ónan
intermediate	some people call it ‘the hotel of mum and dad’. a fifth of young adults are staying in the family home until they are at least 26 and the same proportion are not paying a penny towards their keep. a recent survey found that the proportion of adults living at home varied around the country, from just under 9% in the east midlands to more than double that in london, where house prices and rents are highest. while many around the country contributed financially, it found that 20% were paying nothing at all.young adults are squeezed by low wages and high rents, while those who want to buy a property are finding the monthly cost of renting is preventing them from saving enough to get on the housing ladder. recent research showed half of tenants were unable to save a penny towards a deposit, while a quarter could only save £100 or less each month. mortgages are cheaper than ever before thanks to record low interest rates but the best deals are still only given to people with large deposits.as a result of this, young adults are increasingly returning to the family home to save money and parents who cannot afford to offer their children a large sum of money seem happy to help. the survey found that 28% of adults were living at home because they were trying to save for a deposit. however, it also found that 30% were not saving any money.michael day, 30, who lives with his parents in bristol, says he has been caught between paying high rents and saving for a mortgage deposit. rents for a one-bedroom home in the city are between £500 and £800 a month, while buying a similar property would cost about £130,000. “i don’t really want to move out to rent as it’s more than a mortgage but you need such a big deposit to get a mortgage so it’s a vicious circle.”he does not want to share with strangers so his options are limited. at home, he pays a nominal rent to cover bills and is able to keep the rest of his earnings from his job. he admits that, instead of saving, he spends his spare money on golf and holidays. “you need so much money that i will have to save for the foreseeable future,” he said. “because it’s been so difficult, i’ve been going on holiday and enjoying it.”sue green, of saga, a business that sells insurance to people over 50, said the majority of parents may not have planned to have their children living with them in their 20s or 30s. “most will be more than happy to have them in the family home rent-free because it might help their kids get on the property ladder sooner,” she said. “children who don’t pay rent may contribute in other ways like buying groceries, family takeaways or doing odd jobs around the home.”angus hanton, of the intergenerational foundation thinktank, said older generations were “the architects of the housing crisis” and children should not be blamed for staying at home. “the under-30s have suffered a reduction in average incomes of about 20% since the 2008 downturn. rents and car insurance have never been so high and mortgage lending rules are now stricter for the young but not for older buy-to-let investors, who squeeze out the young,” he said. “many jobs on offer – zero-hour and short-term contracts – are turning younger workers into second-class citizens. rather than blaming the young, we should help them so they can afford to build lives of their own.”jenna gavin, 29, lives in southport, merseyside, in the family home where she grew up. she works as a medical receptionist nearby so she wants to stay in the area. but renting a one-bedroom flat would cost more than £420 a month not including bills, which would use a lot of her earnings. “i don’t want to rent – i don’t want to spend all that money and have nothing at the end,” she said. “i’ve looked at buying and seen mortgage advisers but i just can’t borrow enough to get on the property ladder.”gavin is trying to save for a deposit. “it’s difficult to save enough money – even a 5% deposit is such a lot of money and i would like to have a bigger deposit,” she said. her parents are happy not to charge her rent. “they want me to try to save up and i contribute in other ways – i buy food and i do things around the house.”gavin gets on with her parents and has her own space in a room that she moved into when she was 14 but she said she had always imagined she would have her own place by the time she was 30. “i don’t see that happening, as it’s next year. but, hopefully, in a couple of years, i’ll move out.”nan
intermediate	margaret thatcher, the best known british prime minister since winston churchill in 1940 and a global supporter of free market economics, has died. the british government announced that she would receive a ceremonial funeral at st paul’s cathedral.the british prime minister, david cameron, said: “it was with great sadness that l learned of lady thatcher’s death. we’ve lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great briton.” he added: “as our first woman prime minister, margaret thatcher succeeded against all the odds, and she didn’t just lead our country, she saved our country.” he added that he believed she would be remembered as the greatest british peacetime prime minister.in a statement, president barack obama said, “here in america, many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with president reagan, reminding the world that we can shape the currents of history with our moral beliefs, courage and iron will.”the first woman elected to lead a major western state, margaret thatcher served 11 years at no 10 downing street before members of her own party removed her in 1990.thatcher, who was 87, had been in poor health for some years, suffering from dementia. when they heard of her death, politicians from all parties sent tributes.labour party leader, ed miliband, said: “she will be remembered as a unique figure. she reshaped the politics of a whole generation. she was britain’s first woman prime minister. she moved the centre ground of british politics and was a huge figure on the world stage. the labour party disagreed with a lot of what she did and she will always be a controversial figure. but we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength.”the deputy prime minister, nick clegg, said: “margaret thatcher was one of the most important figures in modern british politics. whatever party you support, no one can deny that as prime minister she left a unique and lasting imprint on the country she served.”describing her as a political phenomenon, the former conservative prime minister sir john major said: “her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.”the “iron lady” was a cold war ally of the us president ronald reagan in the final showdown with the soviet union, which broke up as a result of reformist pressures led by mikhail gorbachev, a kremlin leader with whom thatcher famously said she could “do business”. as a result, many ordinary voters in ex-soviet bloc states saw her as someone who supported their liberty.thatcher was an unremarkable conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975. within ten years, she had become known around the world – both admired and hated – for her pro-market reforms in the uk and her implacable attitudes in foreign policy, including her long battle with the ira, which almost succeeded in murdering her with a bomb in 1984.at home, thatcher was associated with denationalization of state-owned industry – the new word “privatization” became used in many countries – and defeat of militant trade unions, particularly the national union of miners, whose one-year strike (1984–85) was traumatic. with money from britain’s north sea oil fields, thatcher was able to change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies – including moderate members of her own party.in the european union she got a rebate for britain – “my money” as she called it. she was less successful in controlling the european commission, who wanted to centralize power in europe, especially in the years when it was led by the french socialist jacques delors.as the british economy recovered from the very bad recession that her policies had caused, she seemed invincible for a short time. but unlimited power and the defeat or retirement of allies led to mistakes and increasing unpopularity. when her deputy finally fell out with her – mainly on the subject of europe – his damaging resignation speech led to a leadership challenge. after a vote among conservative mps failed to support her, john major took control of the party.after she retired, she wrote highly successful memoirs and campaigned energetically for the thatcher foundation, which aimed to promote her values around the world.nannannan
elementary	at addis ababa airport, visitors see pictures of golden grains, tiny red seeds and a group of men around a giant pancake. the words say: “teff: the best gluten-free crop!”ethiopia is one of the world’s poorest countries, well known for its difficult food situation. but it is also the home of teff, a highly nutritious grain that you can now buy in health-food shops and supermarkets in europe and america.teff’s tiny seeds – the size of poppy seeds – are high in calcium, iron and protein, and also amino acids. you can use the gluten-free grain instead of wheat flour in anything from bread and pasta to waffles and pizza bases.in ethiopia, teff is a national obsession. it is grown by about 6.3 million farmers – fields of the crop cover more than 20% of all farmland. they make it into flour and use it to make injera, the flatbread that is basic to ethiopian cooking. the grain is also important in many religious and cultural ceremonies. across the country, people meet around large pieces of injera. they use it to scoop up stews and to feed one another as a sign of loyalty or friendship – a tradition known as gursha.teff is now called ethiopia’s “second gift to the world”, after coffee.ethiopia’s growing middle class want more teff. this has increased the price of teff, so it is now too expensive for the poorest people. today, most small farmers sell most of what they grow to people in ethiopian cities.teff is the most nutritionally valuable grain in the country. in urban areas, people eat up to 61kg of teff a year. in rural areas, they eat 20kg. the type of teff people eat is different, too: the rich eat the more expensive magna and white teff; poorer people usually eat less-valuable red and mixed teff. they also mix it with cheaper cereals such as sorghum and maize.the ethiopian government wants to double teff production by 2015. it says that the grain could play an important role in school meals and emergency aid programmes, and help reduce malnutrition – particularly among children.in ethiopia, around 20% of children under five are malnourished.the government does not allow the export of raw teff grain, only of injera and other processed products. but this could change: the goal is to produce enough teff for ethiopia and for export.mama fresh is a family company that sells injera to top restaurants and hotels in the ethiopian capital. it also exports the flatbread to finland, germany, sweden and the us, mostly for ethiopians who live there. but the company wants to double exports to america in 2014 and will soon start producing teff-based pizzas, bread and cookies.regassa feyissa, an ethiopian agricultural scientist, says that, without careful planning, growing more teff for export may mean that farmers do not grow other important crops.there is not much ethiopian teff on the international market, so farmers in the us have started planting the crop. farmers in europe, israel and australia have also experimented with growing it.nannannannannan

elementary	the taliban sent a gunman to shoot malala yousafzai in october 2012 as she went home on a bus after school. they wanted to silence the teenager and end her campaign for girls’ education.nine months and many operations later, she stood up at the united nations on her 16th birthday. “they thought that the bullet would silence us. but they failed,” she said.it was an unusual 16th birthday. malala didn’t blow out candles on a cake; she sat at the united nation in the central seat where world leaders usually sit.she listened quietly as ban ki-moon, the un secretary-general, described her as “our hero, our champion”; and as the ex-british prime minister and now un education envoy, gordon brown, said “the words the taliban never wanted her to hear: happy 16th birthday, malala”.the event was named malala day after the girl from mingora in pakistan. she became famous after she wrote a blog for the bbc urdu service – in the blog, she described her difficult experiences of trying to get an education under the power of the taliban.when she was 11, she asked the us special representative to pakistan, richard holbrooke, to help in her campaign against the taliban, who wanted to stop education for girls. by 14, archbishop desmond tutu, suggested her for the international children’s peace prize, and, by 15, she became the youngest nobel peace prize nominee in history.then she got death threats, and, on 9 october 2012, after a meeting of pakistani taliban leaders, the gunman came to kill her.she has had many operations in pakistan and the uk after the shooting on the bus. she now lives with her family in birmingham, england, and does what the taliban tried to stop her doing: she goes to school every day. “i am not against anyone,” she said. and she doesn’t want “personal revenge against the taliban or any other terrorist group.”malala replied to the violence of the taliban with words against bullets. “i do not even hate the talib who shot me. even if there was a gun in my hand and he stood in front of me, i would not shoot him.”“the extremists are afraid of books and pens,” the teenager continued. “the power of education frightens them. they are afraid of women. the power of the voice of women frightens them.”she talked about the attack in june on a hospital in quetta, capital of baluchistan, and killings of female teachers in khyber pakhtunkhwa. “that is why they are blasting schools every day – because they were and they are afraid of change, afraid of the equality that we will bring to our society.”the “stand with malala” petition, that is asking for education for the 57 million children around the world who do not go to school, has got more than four million signatures – more than a million were added after malala’s speech.at the start of her speech, malala said: “i don’t know where to begin my speech. i don’t know what people are expecting me to say.” she did not have to worry.nannan
elementary	the vice-president of google has warned that digitized material from blogs, tweets, pictures, videos and official documents such as emails could be lost forever because the programs we need to view them will no longer exist. our first steps into the digital world could be lost to future historians, vint cerf told the american association for the advancement of science’s annual meeting. he said that we might become a “forgotten generation or even a forgotten century” because of “bit rot”, where old computer files become useless junk.cerf said we should develop digital methods to preserve old software and hardware to read old files. “so much of the information about our daily lives is in digital form, like our interactions by email, people’s tweets and all of the world wide web. so it’s clear that we could lose a lot of our history,” he said. “if we want to keep it, we need to make sure that people can still see the digital objects we create today in the future,” he added.what is ‘bit rot’ and is vint cerf right to be worried? his warning highlights an irony about modern technology: we digitize music, photos, letters and other documents so that they survive for centuries but the programs and hardware people will need to read those files don’t survive.“we are throwing all of our data into an information black hole. we digitize things because we think we will preserve them. but what we don’t understand is that, if we don’t do something, those digital versions may not be any better than the things that we digitized. in fact, they may be worse,” cerf says. “if there are photos you really care about, print them out.”ancient civilizations did not have these problems because people wrote histories down and we need only eyes to read them. to study today’s culture, future historians will have to read pdfs, word documents and hundreds of other file types, using special software and sometimes hardware, too.the problem is already here. in the 1980s, it was normal to save documents on floppy disks and buy computer games on cassettes. even if the disks and cassettes are in good condition, we can now only find the equipment to view them in museums.cerf warns that we will also lose important political and historical documents because of bit rot. in 2005, american historian doris kearns goodwin wrote a book about abraham lincoln. she went to libraries around the us and found the paper letters of the people involved. “in today’s world, those letters would be emails and it will be almost impossible to find them one hundred years from now,” said cerf.he admits that historians will try to preserve important material. but he says that people often don’t understand the importance of documents until hundreds of years later. historians have learned how archimedes thought about infinity in 3bc because they found his writings hidden under the words of a thirteenth-century book. “we’ve been surprised by what we’ve learned from objects that have been preserved by accident,” he said.researchers in pittsburgh are trying to find a solution to bit rot. they are creating a computer that can read old files.inventing new technology helps but it is only part of the solution. it could be even more difficult to get the legal permissions to copy and store software before it dies. “to do this properly, we might need to think about things like copyright. we’re talking about preserving documents for hundreds to thousands of years,” said cerf.
elementary	swiss police recently entered the baur au lac hotel in zurich at dawn and arrested 16 football officials, including five current or former fifa executives. they were later charged with corruption in the us. the officials included the former brazilian federation chief ricardo teixeira and his successor, marco polo del nero.they were among 16 individuals accused of fraud and other crimes by the us department of justice. the us has now charged 27 defendants, including former fifa executives. “the level of corruption is completely unacceptable,” said the us attorney general, loretta lynch.swiss police arrested the president of the south american football confederation, the paraguayan juan ángel napout, and alfredo hawit, the head of the north and central american and caribbean governing body. hawit started his job after jeffrey webb left the job in may 2015 because he was arrested. this was part of the us operation that led to a crisis at fifa and caused sepp blatter to lose his job and reputation.the swiss federal office of justice said of the latest arrests: “they are in custody before their extradition. the us believes they accepted bribes of millions of dollars”. webb and the colombian former executive luis bedoya entered guilty pleas in the us.eleven current and former fifa executives have now been charged in the investigation, which alleges $200m in bribes, mainly from tv and marketing contracts but also fifa’s development programmes.“the message from this announcement should be clear to everyone who hopes to escape our investigation: you will not escape,” said lynch. teixeira, the former son-in-law of the fifa ex-president joão havelange, was charged together with del nero and his predecessor josé maria marin, who was charged in may 2015.fourteen men were charged in may 2015. days later, blatter won a fifth term as president but then agreed to leave his job as the crisis grew. he was then suspended together with the uefa president, michel platini, because of an alleged £1.3m payment to the frenchman. both men might get life bans when the fifa ethics committee hears their case in december if they are found guilty.among those also charged on thursday were rafael salguero, a guatemalan who left the executive committee in may; the former south american confederation secretary general eduardo deluca; former peruvian football federation president manuel burga; and bolivia’s football president, carlos chaves, already jailed in his own country.lynch said: “the department of justice really wants to end the corruption in the leadership of international football – not only because there is such a lot of corruption but also because the corruption is an insult to international principles.”the acting fifa president, issa hayatou, refused to comment on the detail of the latest arrests. but he said neither he nor the organization was corrupt. hayatou appeared for the first time before the media since he started the job in september, when blatter was suspended, and said the current crisis was the fault of a few bad people.“fifa is not corrupt. we have some people that have shown negative behaviour. but not everyone in fifa is corrupt,” said hayatou, president of the confederation of african football for more than 25 years. “there are lots of people who have been in fifa for more than 20 or 30 years that have not been accused of anything.”
elementary	nelson mandela, the most important person in africa’s fight for freedom and a hero to millions of people around the world, has died at the age of 95.south africa’s first black president died with his family with him at home in johannesburg after years of illness.the news was told to the country by the current president, jacob zuma, who said mandela died around 8.50pm local time and was at peace.“this is the moment of our deepest sorrow,” zuma said. “our nation has lost its greatest son.“south africans, nelson mandela brought us together and it is together that we will say goodbye to him.”zuma said that mandela would receive a state funeral.barack obama called mandela by his clan name – madiba. the us president said: “madiba transformed south africa – and moved all of us.”uk prime minister david cameron said: “a great light has gone out in the world” and he described mandela as “a hero of our time”.fw de klerk – the south african president who freed mandela from prison and shared the nobel peace prize with him in 1993 – said the news was very sad for south africa and the world.he was a great unifier,” de klerk said.in soweto, people came together to sing and dance near the house where mandela once lived. they sang songs from the anti-apartheid struggle. some people were wearing south african flags and the green, yellow and black colours of mandela’s party, the african national congress (anc).mandela’s death sends south africa deep into mourning nearly 20 years after he led the country from racial apartheid to democracybut his death will also be felt by people around the world who thought mandela was one of history’s last great political leaders, similar to gandhi and martin luther king.after spending 27 years in prison, including 18 years on robben island, mandela won the country’s first multiracial election in 1994, with his party, the anc.born with the name rolihlahla dalibhunga in a small village in the eastern cape on 18 july, 1918, a teacher at mandela’s school gave him his english name, nelson.he joined the anc in 1943. in 1952, he started south africa’s first black law firm with his partner, oliver tambo.when the anc was banned in 1960, mandela went underground. after the sharpeville massacre, in which 69 black protesters were shot dead by police, he took the difficult decision to begin an armed struggle. he was arrested and sent to prison for life.finally, in 1990, fw de klerk ended the ban on the anc and mandela was released from prison.archbishop desmond tutu, said: “he made people believe in africa and africans again.”mandela’s 91st birthday was celebrated by the first annual “mandela day” in his honour. he was married three times and he had six children, 17 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.nannannannannannannannannannan
elementary	an international agreement to improve safety in bangladesh’s clothes factories could face legal action. this is because factory owners are asking for compensation for the cost of closures and repair work. some repairs may take months and factory owners say they cannot pay workers while factories are closed. also, they cannot pay for big works to make buildings safe. the building repairs are happening after the rana plaza building in the capital of bangladesh, dhaka, collapsed in 2013 and 1,138 people died.the problems come as hundreds of bangladeshi clothes factories are inspected every month for fire-safety and structural problems under the accord on fire and building safety in bangladesh. the accord is supported by over 170 international companies, including primark and marks & spencer, and international trade unions, including industriall.the owner of one dhaka factory, softex cotton, said he will take legal action against the accord because his factory was closed down as a result of structural problems. he wants around $100 million in compensation.another factory owner said that, when a factory closed, even for a few months, it would lose orders and close permanently: “there is no such thing as temporary closure,” he said. the factory owner said it was not clear in the accord agreement who would pay for factory closures.jenny holdcroft, policy director for industriall, which has been closely involved in the accord, said that the agreement made sure that factories would not lose orders during closure because companies agreed to continue orders with suppliers for two years.the accord has found12 factories that need a lot of work, but holdcroft said many of those only needed partial closure and production could continue on other floors. the accord also asks companies to make sure that workers receive pay during factory closures. she said that factory owners who could afford to pay for repairs and compensation for workers should make the payments.“companies don’t want to pay so that rich factory owners can continue to just take the profits and not spend on their factories for years. it is not surprising that there is disruption. if there was no disruption, there would be no change,” she said. a spokesman for the accord said negotiations over payments and even legal action would not delay its work to improve safety in factories.but there is now more pressure on the accord to help pay workers when their factories close. a rival factory-safety group, supported by us retailers including walmart and gap, the alliance for bangladesh worker safety, has given $5 million to help pay factory workers for up to two months while buildings are improved.“the alliance is sharing the workers’ salary with factory owners so now there is a big confusion. we had a big meeting with the accord to make them understand they have to help or how will we help our workers?” said shaidullah azim, a director of the bangladeshi garment manufacturers and exporters association.
elementary	george w bush, benedict cumberbatch and stephen hawking have done it. david cameron, barack obama and pamela anderson have refused to do it. the ice bucket challenge began in the us in july. it has raised $100 million for the als association, an american motor neurone disease charity, and £4.5 million for a british charity, as well as thousands of pounds for charities in hong kong and australia.but some people are unhappy with the ice bucket challenge. animal-rights groups and environmentalists (people who want to protect the natural world) have criticized it. some people say it wastes water. other people criticize it because some people enjoy the fun and then do not donate anything to charity.but the challenge continues to grow. if you don’t know how it works, someone gives a short speech to camera about the charity, then throws a bucket of ice cubes in water over their head or asks a friend to do it. then, they give the names of three other people who have to do the same or donate money to the charity.it was an unlucky coincidence that the ice bucket challenge was happening during world water week, when people from all over the world met in stockholm to discuss the planet’s water crisis. the charity wateraid is asking people to use recycled water from their baths or rainwater from their gardens, or to use sea water.douglas graham, of the uk motor neurone association, said: “we are not surprised about the criticism but this is a wonderful windfall and we’re so grateful. we didn’t expect it but, suddenly, the donations just started.” the money is a very big help to a small charity that looks after sufferers of a terrible disease that has no cure and kills five people a day in the uk.former baywatch star and animal-rights activist pamela anderson wrote a public letter to the als association. in the letter, she said that she did not like the charity’s use of animal experimentation. a few us stars have rejected the challenge because of california’s drought. actor matt damon solved the problem by using water from his toilet. actor verne troyer used milk, also for environmental reasons. and some people say the challenge caused a water shortage on the scottish island of colonsay.another criticism is that small charities won’t know what to do with the extra money but the mnd association rejects this. “oh, we know what to do with the extra money here,” said graham. “we pay for research to find the causes of the disease, and a treatment or cure. we give care and support to 3,500 people and they need it because this disease is expensive to manage. more than 50% of people with the disease die within two years.”but, for many people with a connection to the disease, the awareness that the challenge has created is as important as the money. normally, the mnd association gets about 300,000 hits a year on its website. on just one day recently, it had 330,000 hits.“it is great to donate to any charity. i understand that some people might want to donate to a different charity,” said graham. “in 2013, british people gave £62 billion to charity – we should be proud of that. it’s fabulous for us to get this windfall. over the next few weeks, we will decide how to spend the money in the best way.”nannan
elementary	a new report says that almost one billion people will remain in extreme poverty by 2030 if countries donõt try to solve the social, economic and cultural problems that keep them poor. the report by the chronic poverty advisory network says that many people may rise above the poverty line of $1.25 a day, but fall back again when they have problems such as drought or illness and insecurity or con ict.the report found that, in parts of rural kenya and in south africa, 30 to 40% of people who escaped from poverty fell back again. this percentage rose to 60% in some areas of ethiopia between 1999 and 2009. even in successful countries such as indonesia and vietnam, the proportion was 20%.individual examples show how easy it is for people to fall back into poverty. amin is from a village in bangladesh. his income has fallen slowly, because of his illness and his wifeõs illness, the cost of his sonõs marriage, the death of his father and loss of goods such as  shing nets. lovemore, from zimbabwe, is now one of the poorest people in his village. he recently lost his job because of ill health and has to look after his  ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters.òwe need to make sure that people who come out of poverty remain above the poverty line permanently. too many families return to poverty when they have personal or bigger problems. governments shouldnõt assume that, just because somebodyõs income hits $1.25, that means the problem is solved,ó said andrew shepherd, the main author of the report.according to the un, the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 is still possible. but the report says that countries need to make changes to achieve zero poverty. there was a drop in extreme poverty from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 1.2 billion in 2010, but the report says that progress in the next 15 years will be much more dif cult. there has been a lot of progress in china but there will probably not be similar progress in other parts of the world.the report says countries should try to help the chronically poor ð those who are poor for many years or their entire lives ð and stop people becoming poor. ògovernments have been quite good at moving people over the poverty line because that is quite easy. but they have avoided the more dif cult job of trying to reduce chronic poverty,ó said shepherd.the report says progress on poverty reduction has helped people who were already closer to the poverty line, but has helped the chronically poor much less. it will not be possible to get to zero poverty if development policies donõt focus on the chronically poor, it adds. the report suggests three ideas. they all cost a lot of money.the  rst is social help ð to bring the poorest people closer to a good-enough standard of living. the second is education, from early childhood to the start of work, so people can escape and stay out of poverty. the third is economic growth policies that make sure that the bene ts of increasing national wealth reach the poorest people.all this will cost money and the report says higher taxes will be necessary. aid will also be necessary for the start-up costs for social assistance, healthcare for everyone and to  nance education. òthere remains a huge role for aid in the next 20 years, as many developing countries spend less than $500 on each of their citizens a year. even nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per person,ó shepherd said.the authors say governments should have a national development plan and make sure the poorest people are represented politically as well as trying to stop dif cult social customs, such as dowries and witchcraft, that make extreme poverty worse.nannannannan
advanced	brazil’s latest funk sensation, anitta, has won millions of fans by taking the favela sound into the mainstream, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour.anti-discrimination campaigners and social commentators say the music industry’s fastest rising star has had to sacrifice her blackness to make it into the predominantly white middleclass market.the controversy was prompted by the publication of then-and-now photographs that show a dramatic lightening of anitta’s skin tone since she signed a deal with warner.in the first, when she was relatively unknown, she looked darker. in the second – a marketing shot after she became famous – she seems paler. whether this was the result of whitening products and cosmetic surgery or – more likely – photoshop tweaks, the contrast has rekindled discussion about whether you need to be pale to get ahead in brazil.jarid arraes, a psychology student and blogger, wrote a post criticizing the latent discrimination in media and marketing that she felt anitta’s image change represented. “people refuse to accept that they are racist and they think they live in a multiracial democracy, but the statistics show that is far from the case. the whitening shows us a profoundly intolerant society that doesn’t support diversity. white is the image of the rich, the nice, the successful, the good, while people see black as the opposite of all that.”born larissa de macedo machado, the diva-to-be was a church chorister in her childhood. in her teens, she made a name for herself in rio de janeiro’s baile funk scene as a dancer and singer.she has now exploded into the public consciousness with an album and a huge hit single, show das poderosas, which topped the charts and attracted 52 million youtube views.though adored first and foremost as a pop idol with a strong message and some catchy tunes, her backers project her as a cultural bridge between the predominantly black and mixed-race shanty towns on rio’s hillsides and the wealthier and whiter communities below.she has toned down the suggestive dancing, gangsta references and explicit lyrics of baile funk. now, however, questions are being asked about whether she – or her marketing team – have gone too far in re-tailoring her image to attract a more lucrative demographic. “if pop stars have curly hair, they are going to feel coerced into straightening it. if they have a big nose, they will be coerced into getting rhinoplasty,” said arraes. “it creates a vicious cycle for self-esteem.”this is a sensitive topic in this largely mixed-raced nation. brazil – one of the last big countries in the world to ban slavery – has the largest population of african descent outside africa, but race and ancestry are less important here than colour. and, despite the nation’s goal of being a multiracial democracy, there is a clear link between skin tone and inequality.in brazilian cities, white workers earn roughly twice as much as those of african descent. up until 2011, black or mixed-race students also spent two years less at school on average.the government says the gap is closing thanks to quota systems for university places and other forms of affirmative action. but the gulf remains glaringly apparent. the vast majority of business and government executives are white, while most menial jobs are done by black and mixed-race workers. walk through ipanema, gávea or other upmarket districts and you are far more likely to see black nannies pushing strollers with white toddlers than a white nanny pushing a black child.defining colour is complex. people who define themselves as white were in the minority for the first time in the most recent census in 2010. among the 197 million population, 82 million said they were “pardu” (mixed race), 15 million black, two million asian and 0.5% indigenous.sylvio ferreira, a psychology lecturer at the federal university of pernambuco, believes anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it tamer and more palatable to everyone.“was this achieved by racial whitening? no,” he said. “what happened was a change of the social space where anitta produced her art: from the periphery to the centre.”others agree that the issue of colour is overblown. maycon de mattos batista, a financial analyst who worked with anitta while she was an intern, said there had been a huge change in anitta’s image, but not of her colour.“i don’t believe it’s whitening; it’s more the way they are producing her with makeup, hairstylists and the way she dresses,” he said. “i don’t think that was because of pressure being put on her. she always liked to show off, sing and dance. that was a natural thing for her. i believe that it is because of this naturalness that she is where she is today.”leandro silva de souza, a racial equality activist in the north-eastern city of salvador, said the prejudice lay not with society but with music producers and media executives. the public, he said, proved they were interested in music for its own sake by choosing ellen oléria – a black lesbian – as the recent winner of the talent show the voice brazil.the guardian was unable to reach anitta for comment. but, in a recent interview, she described the need for identity to be self-defined.“all-powerful is a woman who doesn’t need to be beautiful, but she has so much attitude that she is marvellous, she is powerful. what i try to pass on in my work for everyone is that we can be who we want.”
advanced	throughout a momentous day at liverpool’s anglican cathedral for the families of the 96 people who died so needlessly at sheffield wednesday’s hillsborough football ground, one phrase dominated above all else: the truth. these were the words most infamously abused by a headline in the sun newspaper, above stories which we now know, in extraordinarily shocking detail, were fed by the south yorkshire police to deflect their own culpability for the disaster on to the innocent victims.margaret aspinall, whose son james, then 18, died at what should have been a joyful day out, an fa cup semi-final between liverpool and nottingham forest, said the families had been forced to fight, for 23 years, for just that: the truth. aspinall, chair of the hillsborough family support group, said that, although the families’ loss would never fade, she was “delighted” at the unequivocal, “profound” apology given for hillsborough’s savage failings by david cameron.the hillsborough independent panel had inspected 450,000 documents generated by the police, sheffield wednesday and all other bodies responsible, and delivered its remarkable 395-page report indicting official failings and vindicating the victims and football supporters.some of what happened to cause the disaster, and the police’s subsequent blame-shifting, has been exposed before. but the depth of what the families call a cover-up, in particular the deliberate police campaign to avoid its own responsibilities and falsely blame the supporters, was still startling.in a concerted campaign – led, the panel found, by the chief constable, peter wright – the south yorkshire police put out their story that drunken supporters or those without tickets had caused the disaster. the victims had their blood tested for alcohol levels. this was “an exceptional decision”, the panel said, for which it found “no rationale”. when victims had alcohol in their blood, the police then checked to find if they had criminal records.the report, substantially authored by professor phil scraton of queen’s university, belfast, and unanimously agreed by the panel of eight experts, found there was “no evidence … to verify the serious allegations of exceptional levels of drunkenness, ticketlessness or violence among liverpool fans”.the report found that even as the nightmare began for the families of the victims, wright was meeting his police federation in a sheffield restaurant to prepare “a defence” and “a rock-solid story”. the secretary of the south yorkshire police federation branch, constable paul middup, told the restaurant meeting before wright turned up: “the chief constable had said the truth could not come from him, but had given the secretary a totally free hand and supported him,” as had many senior officers.the meeting was held just four days after the disaster. it was the day that the sun splashed its headline “the truth” over lies fed to it by four senior south yorkshire police officers. middup was encouraged to continue this police campaign of defaming liverpool supporters for supposed drunkenness and misbehaviour and “to get the message – togetherness – across to the force”.the panel’s report sustained the allegation made in parliament that the orchestrated changing of junior officers’ statements by senior south yorkshire police officers amounted to a “black propaganda unit”. the officers’ statements, presented as official police accounts to the subsequent inquiry, were changed to delete criticism of the police themselves on the day, and, largely, emphasize misbehaviour by supporters. the panel found that 116 of 164 statements were amended “to remove or alter comments unfavourable to south yorkshire police”.the police had claimed this was done only to remove “conjecture” and “opinion” from the statements, but the panel had no doubt the operation, to craft a case rather than deliver truthful police accounts, went further. “it was done to remove criticism of the police,” scraton said.this propaganda did not convince the original inquiry, which ruled as quickly as august 1989 that the police stories of fan drunkenness and misbehaviour were false, and criticized the police for making the claims. the report revealed that sheffield wednesday’s football ground was unsafe in crucial respects, that the football association had selected it as the venue for the match without even checking if hillsborough had a valid safety certificate, which it did not.in that landscape of neglect, it was the mismanagement of the crowd by the police, commanded by an inexperienced chief superintendent david duckenfield, that was “the prime cause” of the disaster. the police lost control outside the ground, where 24,000 liverpool fans had to be funnelled through just 23 turnstiles, so duckenfield ordered a large exit gate to be opened and a large number of people to be allowed in. his “blunder of the first magnitude”, according to the inquiry, was the failure to close off the tunnel that led to the already overcrowded central section of the leppings lane terrace.the inquiry report established this but the police, undaunted, repeated their claims to the subsequent inquest. its procedure was marked by the coroner’s decision not to take evidence of what happened after 3.15pm on the day of the disaster, thereby excluding an emergency response the panel found to have been chaotic. the finding that 41 of the 96 who died could possibly have been saved had the police and ambulance service done their jobs decently is damning of those bodies and, aspinall said, difficult for the families to contemplate.in the light of the panel’s report, the attorney general will now consider whether to apply to the high court for the inquest verdict of accidental death to be quashed and a new inquest held. there may be prosecutions too, after all these years, of sheffield wednesday, south yorkshire police and sheffield city council, which failed in its duty to oversee the safety of the football ground. trevor hicks, the president of the hfsg, both of whose teenage daughters, sarah and victoria, died in the crush, said:

advanced	crunchy, full of protein and to be found under a rock near you. insects have long been overlooked as food in all but a handful of places around the world – but now they are crawling closer and closer to our plates. spring 2013 will see a drive towards removing the yuck factor and putting insects not just on experimental gastronomic menus but also on supermarket shelves.in april, there will be a festival in london, pestival 2013 – a wellcome trust-backed insect appreciation event where the consumption of creepy-crawlies comes high on the agenda. it will feature a two-day “pop-up” restaurant by the nordic food lab, the scandinavian team behind the danish restaurant noma, which brought ants to the table for a sellout ten-day run at claridge’s hotel in mayfair in 2012.noma has been named the world’s best restaurant by restaurant magazine for three years running. its chef, rené redzepi, says that ants taste like lemon, and a purée of fermented grasshoppers and moth larvae tastes like a strong fish sauce. bee larvae make a sweet mayonnaise used in place of eggs and scientists are constantly coming up with new ways to use little creatures.in march, a bbc documentary will feature food writer stefan gates searching out and eating deep-fried locusts and barbecued tarantulas. but, behind all the gimmicks and jokes about flies in the soup there is a deeply serious message. many experts believe there is a clear environmental benefit to humans eating creepy-crawlies.the un’s food and agriculture organization (fao) has been funding projects since 2011 aimed at promoting the eating and farming of insects in south-east asia and africa, where an estimated two billion people already eat insects and caterpillar larvae as a regular part of their diet. in 2012, the fao published a list of 1,909 edible species of insect and, with sponsorship from the dutch government, plans a major international conference on “this valuable food source” in 2013.insects are plentiful – globally, for every human there are 40 tonnes of insects – so there is not too much chance of them being endangered, and they are unlikely to have been dosed with chemicals. “i know it’s taboo to eat bugs in the western world, but why not?”, redzepi has said. “you go to south-east asia and this is a common thing. you read about it from all over the world, that people are eating bugs. if you like mushrooms, you’ve eaten so many worms you cannot imagine. but also we eat honey, and honey is the vomit of a bee. think of that next time you pour it into your tea.”he said that the basic premise behind nordic food lab was: “nothing is not edible.”insects are critical to life on earth and, with more than a million species, are the most diverse group of creatures on the planet, yet they are misunderstood, hated and often put to death by humans just because they are there.over the next 30 years, the planet’s human population will increase to nine billion. already one billion people do not get enough food. the increase will mean more pressure on agricultural land, water, forests, fisheries and biodiversity resources, as well as nutrients and energy supplies.the cost of meat is rising, not just in terms of hard cash but also in terms of the amount of rainforest that is destroyed for grazing or to grow feedstuff for cattle. there is also the issue of methane excreted by cows. the livestock farming contribution, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, is enormous – 35% of the planet’s methane, 65% of its nitrous oxide and 9% of the carbon dioxide.edible insects emit fewer gases, contain high-quality protein, vitamins and amino acids, and have a high food-conversion rate, needing a quarter of the food intake of sheep, and half of pigs and chickens, to produce the same amount of protein. they emit fewer greenhouse gases and less ammonia than cows and can be grown on organic waste. china is already successfully setting up huge maggot farms. zimbabwe has a thriving mapone caterpillar industry and laos was given nearly $500,000 by the fao to develop an insect-harvesting project. it’s already big business in the uk, though not always official: a man was recently detained by gatwick customs as he stepped off a flight from burkina faso with 94 kilos of mapone, worth nearly £40,000, in his luggage.a study by foodservicewarehouse.com suggested that swapping pork and beef for crickets and locusts could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 95%. but perhaps the fairest thing about eating worms and insects comes when we are dead – then they get a chance to nibble their own back.
advanced	the vast fortunes made by the world’s richest 100 billionaires are driving up inequality and hindering the world’s ability to tackle poverty, according to oxfam.the charity said the accumulation of wealth and income on an unprecedented scale, often at the expense of secure jobs and decent wages for the poorest, undermined the ability of people who survive on aid or low wages to improve their situation and escape poverty.oxfam said the world’s poorest could be lifted out of poverty several times over if the richest 100 billionaires would give away the money they made in 2012.without pointing a finger at individuals, the charity argued that the $240bn net income amassed in 2012 by the richest 100 billionaires would be enough to make extreme poverty history four times over.it is rare for charities to attack the wealthy, who are usually regarded as a source of funding. bill gates and warren buffett are among a group of 40 us billionaires who have pledged much of their wealth to aid projects, but there is little detail about the level of their annual donations. their actions have also not been matched by russian, middle eastern or chinese billionaires.in the report, the cost of inequality: how wealth and income extremes hurt us all, published just before the world economic forum in davos, the charity calls on world leaders to curb income extremes and commit to reducing inequality to at least 1990 levels.the report found that the richest 1% had increased their incomes by 60% in the past 20 years, with the financial crisis accelerating rather than slowing the process.barbara stocking, oxfam’s chief executive, said extreme wealth was “economically inefficient, politically corrosive, socially divisive and environmentally destructive”.she said studies show that countries suffer low levels of investment and growth as workers are forced to survive on a smaller share of total incomes.she said: “we can no longer pretend that the creation of wealth for a few will inevitably benefit the many – too often the reverse is true.”the report said the issue affected all parts of the world. “in the uk, inequality is rapidly returning to levels not seen since the time of charles dickens [the nineteenth-century novelist]. in china, the top 10% now take home nearly 60% of the income. chinese inequality levels are now similar to those in south africa, which is now the most unequal country on earth and significantly more unequal than at the end of apartheid.”in the us, the share of national income going to the top 1% has doubled since 1980 from 10 to 20%, the report says. for the top 0.01% the share of national income is above levels last seen in the 1920s.the world bank and international monetary fund have argued that extreme income inequality undermines growth and both organizations have attempted to tie their loans to programmes that limit the growth of inequality.members of the richest 1% are estimated to use as much as 10,000 times more carbon than the average us citizen.oxfam said world leaders should learn from countries such as brazil, which has grown rapidly while reducing inequality.stocking said: “we need a global new deal to reverse decades of increasing inequality. as a first step, world leaders should formally commit themselves to reducing inequality to the levels seen in 1990.”she said closing tax havens, which the tax justice network says hold as much as $31 trillion, or as much as a third of all global wealth, could yield $189bn in additional tax revenues.
advanced	dna taken from the wisdom tooth of a european hunter-gatherer has given scientists an unprecedented glimpse of modern humans before the rise of farming. the mesolithic man, who lived in spain around 7,000 years ago, had an unusual mix of blue eyes, black or brown hair and dark skin, according to analyses of his genetic make-up.he was probably lactose intolerant and had more difficulty digesting starchy foods than the farmers who transformed diets and lifestyles when they took up tools in the first agricultural revolution.the invention of farming brought humans and animals into much closer contact and humans likely evolved more robust immune systems to fend off infections that the animals passed on. but scientists may have overestimated the impact farming had in shaping the human immune system, because tests on the hunter-gathererõs dna found that he already carried mutations that boost the immune system to tackle various nasty bugs. some live on in modern europeans today.òbefore we started this work, i had some ideas of what we were going to find,ó said carles lalueza-fox, who led the study at the institute of evolutionary biology in barcelona. òmost of those ideas turned out to be completely wrong.óthe spanish team started their work after a group of cavers stumbled upon two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the cantabrian mountains of northwest spain in 2006. the human remains, which belonged to two men in their early 30s, had been extremely well preserved by the cool environment of the cave.carbon dating put the remains at around 7,000 years old, before farming had swept into europe from the middle east. the timing fitted with ancient artefacts found at the site, including perforated reindeer teeth that were strung and hung from the peopleõs clothing.the scientists focused their efforts on the better preserved of the two skeletons. after several failed attempts, they managed to reconstruct the manõs entire genome from dna found in the root of a third molar. it is the first time researchers have obtained the complete genome of a modern european who lived before the neolithic revolution.the dna threw up a series of surprises. when lalueza-fox looked at the genome, he found that, rather than having light skin, the man had gene variants that tend to produce much darker skin. òthis guy had to be darker than any modern european, but we donõt know how dark,ó the scientist said.another surprise finding was that the man had blue eyes. that was unexpected, said lalueza-fox, because the mutation for blue eyes was thought to have arisen more recently than the mutations that cause lighter skin colour. the results suggest that blue eye colour came first in europe, with the transition to lighter skin ongoing through mesolithic times.on top of the scientific impact, artists might have to rethink their drawings of the people. òyou see a lot of reconstructions of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern europeans with light skin. you never see a reconstruction of a mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eye colour,ó lalueza-fox said.the spanish team went on to compare the genome of the hunter-gatherer to those of modern europeans from different regions to see how they might be related. they found that the ancient dna most closely matched the genetic make-up of people living in northern europe, in particular sweden and finland.the discovery of mutations that bolstered the immune system against bacteria and viruses suggests that the shift to a farming culture in neolithic times did not drive all of the changes in immunity genes that europeans carry today. at least some of those genetic changes have a history that stretches further back. òone thing we donõt know is what sort of pathogens were affecting these people,ó said lalueza-fox.martin jones, professor of archaeological science at cambridge university, said the immunity genes were the most striking result. òthere is a no doubt oversimplified grand narrative that the move from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to settled farming was initially bad for our health. a number of factors contributed, particularly living closely together with other humans and animals, shrinking the food web and crowding out water supplies. the authors are drawing attention to the role of pathogens in pre-agricultural lives and that is interesting.ó
advanced	angela erdmann never knew her grandfather. he died in 1946, six years before she was born. but, on tuesday 8th april, 2014, she described the extraordinary moment when she received a message in a bottle, 101 years after he had lobbed it into the baltic sea. thought to be the world’s oldest message in a bottle, it was presented to erdmann by the museum that is now exhibiting it in germany.“it was very surprising,” erdmann, 62, said, recalling how she found out about the bottle. “a man stood at my door and told me he had post from my grandfather. he then told me that a message in a bottle had been found and that the name that was on the card was that of my grandfather.” her visitor was a genealogical researcher who had managed to track her down in berlin after the letter was given to the international maritime museum in the northern port city of hamburg.the brown beer bottle, which had been in the water for 101 years, was found in the catch of konrad fischer, a fisherman, who had been out in the baltic sea off the northern city of kiel. holger von neuhoff, curator for ocean and science at the museum, said this bottled message was the oldest he had come across. “there are documents that have been found without the bottle that are older and are in the museum,” he said. “but, with the bottle and the document, this is certainly the oldest at the moment. it is in extremely good condition.”researchers believe erdmann’s grandfather, richard platz, threw the bottle in the sea while on a hike with a nature appreciation group in 1913. he was 20 years old at the time.much of the postcard was indecipherable, although the address in berlin on the front of the card was legible, as was the author’s polite request that the note be sent by the finder to his home address.“he also included two stamps from that time that were also in the bottle, so the finder would not incur a cost,” erdmann said. “but he did not think it would take 101 years.”she said she was moved by the arrival of the message, although she had not known her grandfather because he died, at the age of 54, six years before she was born.“i knew very little about my grandfather, but i found out that he was a writer who was very open-minded, and believed in freedom and that everyone should respect each other,” she said. “he did a lot for the young and later travelled with his wife and two daughters. it was wonderful because i could see where my roots came from.”like her grandfather, erdmann said, she also liked culture and travelling around the world. she described herself as open-minded, too. “what he taught his two daughters, my mother taught me and i have then given to my sons,” she said. despite her joy at receiving the bottled message, she said that she hoped others would not repeat what her grandfather had done and throw bottles with messages into the sea. “today, the sea is so full of so many bottles and rubbish that more shouldn’t be thrown in there,” she said.the message and the bottle will be on display at hamburg’s maritime museum until the beginning of may 2014, after which experts will attempt to decipher the rest of the text. it is not clear what will then happen to the bottle, but erdmann hopes it will stay at the museum.“we want to make a few photos available to put with the bottle and give it a face, so visitors can see the young man who threw the bottle into the water,” she said.
advanced	an atmosphere of melancholy and changing times pervades the opening to the final series of downton abbey. the year is 1925 and there are already the first rumblings of the economic storms that will blight the end of the decade. the neighbours are selling up their own stately home, while lord grantham seeks to cut back on servants after declaring that under-butlers are no longer affordable.but at the real downton abbey, highclere castle – a stately home owned by george “geordie” herbert, 8th earl of carnarvon – the financial outlook has rarely been brighter. according to lady fiona carnarvon, the huge global success of downton has funded a rolling programme of building repairs aimed at safeguarding highclere for the next generation.“it’s been an amazing magic carpet ride for all of us,” she said. “it’s given us a wonderful marketing platform, an international profile. i’m hugely grateful. my husband and i love the house, and the people here. now, without doubt, it is loved by millions of other people.”currently, only the ground and first floors of highclere, on the borders of hampshire, are used. but, a restoration project of derelict tower rooms has begun that will eventually allow visitors to climb up into the tower to an exhibition showcasing the work of the architect of the houses of parliament, sir charles barry, who rebuilt the house between 1839 and 1842.when the downton abbey producers first approached highclere in 2009, the family faced a near £12m repair bill, with urgent work priced at £1.8m. but, by 2012, the downton effect had begun to take the pressure off. lord carnarvon said then: “it was just after the banking crisis and it was gloom in all directions. we had been doing corporate functions but it all became pretty sparse after that. then, downton came along and it became a major tourist attraction.”visitor numbers doubled, to 1,200 a day, as downton abbey, scripted by julian fellowes, came to be screened around the world after becoming a hit in the uk in 2010 and, then, in the us. it is now broadcast in 250 countries.the formerly somewhat basic ticketing policy has become a computerized advance booking system, helping to guarantee foreign visitors admission. the accounts of highclere enterprises for 2014-15 show current assets have almost trebled to around £1m since 2012. gareth neame, the executive producer for the series, said: “i think downton abbey secured highclere’s future.”peter fincham, itv’s director of television, recalls the moment when highclere was booked. “i thought, ‘so what?’, because i had never heard of highclere castle. one stately home looks much the same as another. how wrong i was. the castle has been one enormous character as well.”the downton tourists are part of a growing phenomenon. visitbritain estimates that nearly 30% of foreign visitors, or nearly nine million people, include castles and historic houses on their itineraries. almost half of potential visitors to britain now say they want to indulge in “set jetting”, visiting places featured in films or on tv.more than a million embark on a tour of historic buildings each year, spending in excess of £1bn. from the biggest emerging tourist markets, 51% of brazilians, 42% of russians and chinese, and 35% of indian visitors are likely to include a visit to a site of interest in their trips.visitbritain’s director, patricia yates, said: “the links between tourism, films and tv are potent ones.” she added that period dramas have also raised the popularity of regions outside of london.neame is now an ambassador for the great britain campaign, which is backed by government departments and the british council, using it to promote the uk around the world. events include special downton-themed receptions at british embassies.neame said: “they approached me because of the reach. a lot of people here think of it as soapy entertainment. in other parts of the world, people revere our actors, our writing and production talent. it is something i am passionate about; i am a really strong believer in soft power. we are not nearly as proud of our achievements as we should be.“downton abbey is iconic for expressing britishness. really, it is a fantasy world, based in a particular time in history. it’s the first tv period drama that has really leapt out of the screen and become part of popular culture.”lady carnarvon is still keen to emphasize that the long-term future of highclere is not necessarily secure. “the bottom line is quite thin,” she said. “the programme has allowed us to spend faster on the buildings, have the follies restored.”in the pipeline is a tutankhamun centenary event in 2022, 100 years after the 5th earl of carnarvon, together with howard carter, discovered the tomb that revolutionized our understanding of egyptology. another opportunity to keep highclere in the public mind is the 300th anniversary of the birth of lancelot “capability” brown, who designed the grounds.“what you do is never sit on your laurels. every single day, don’t take anything for granted,” said lady carnarvon. “for all these great houses, you have to invest in them. and, there has been a deficit since the 1930s. perhaps, in the past, an estate and house defined and supported the family and their lifestyle but, today, it is quite the reverse: the challenge is how geordie and i seek to support and look after highclere.“from my point of view, i’ve tried to persuade people it is fun and have specific events they can engage with, not just a wander around a dusty house. we have to compete with attractions like the london dungeon.”
advanced	loneliness has finally become a hot topic – the office for national statistics has found britain to be the loneliest country in europe. british people are less likely to have strong friendships or know their neighbours than residents anywhere else in the eu and a relatively high proportion of them have no one to rely on in a crisis. meanwhile, research by professor john cacioppo at the university of chicago has found loneliness to be twice as bad for older people’s health as obesity and almost as great a cause of death as poverty.but, shocking as this is, such studies overlook the loneliness epidemic among younger adults. in 2010, the mental health foundation found loneliness to be a greater concern among young people than the elderly. the 18- to 34-year-olds surveyed were more likely to feel lonely often, to worry about feeling alone and to feel depressed because of loneliness than the over-55s.“loneliness is a recognized problem among the elderly – there are day centres and charities to help them,” says sam challis, an information manager at the mental health charity mind, “but, when young people reach 21, they’re too old for youth services.” this is problematic because of the close relationship between loneliness and mental health – it is linked to increased stress, depression, paranoia, anxiety, addiction, cognitive decline and is a known factor in suicide. in a new essay, paul farmer, the chief executive of mind, and jenny edwards, the chief executive of the mental health foundation, say it can be both a cause and effect of mental health problems.but what can young people do to combat loneliness? dr grant blank, a survey research fellow at the oxford internet institute, points out that social media and the internet can be a boon and a problem. they are beneficial when they enable us to communicate with distant loved ones, but not when they replace face-to-face contact. “people present an idealized version of themselves online and we expect to have social lives like those portrayed in the media,” says challis. comparing friends’ seemingly perfect lives with ours can lead us to withdraw socially.while meditation techniques and apps such as headspace are trendy solutions frequently recommended for a range of mental health problems, they’re not necessarily helpful for loneliness, as they actively encourage us to dwell alone on our thoughts. “you’d be better off addressing the underlying causes of being lonely first – what’s stopping you going out and seeing people?” asks challis.indeed, a study of social media at the university of michigan in 2013 found that, while facebook reduces life satisfaction, using technology to help you meet new people can be beneficial. and, if for whatever reason, you are unable to venture outside, the internet can bring solace. mumsnet has been “an absolute godsend” for maddy matthews, 19, a student with a two-month-old daughter. since the birth, she rarely sees her university friends and her partner works most evenings. “in the first few days, i was up late at night feeding her and i was worried i was doing something wrong. being able to post on mumsnet has helped me feel less alone.”helplines can also reduce loneliness, at least in the short term. one in four men who call the emotional support charity samaritans mention loneliness or isolation and get connected is a free confidential helpline for young people, where they can seek help with emotional and mental health issues often linked to loneliness. there are also support services on websites such as mind’s that can remind you you’re not alone.at work, it can be beneficial to tell your employer how you’re feeling. john binns, who advises businesses on mental health and well-being, was admitted to hospital for stress-related depression in 2007 and took two months off work. he felt as if there was no one to talk to and he wasn’t close enough to colleagues for them to notice the changes in his behaviour. greater openness with his employer and colleagues made his return to work easier. “often people find that colleagues are more supportive than they’d expected. mine started to reach out, asking me to lunch and reassuring me that the world hadn’t moved on that much since i’d left.”office chit-chat may seem like a waste of time, but it helps to cushion us from the emotional and psychological effects of work strain. “if you form connections with your team, you might be stressed but not isolated,” says rick hughes, the british association for counselling and psychotherapy’s (bacp) lead adviser for the workplace.“we treat the networks we have as incidental but they’re fundamental to our well-being,” says nicky forsythe, a psychotherapist and the founder of talk for health, a social enterprise that trains people to give and receive peer support in groups. “the most important thing is to have a regular time and place to reflect on your life and to have an empathetic listener.”for developing personal skills such as empathy, counselling can help. the bacp website allows you to search for counsellors in your area. “a problem aired is a problem shared and sometimes you need to talk to someone impartial and independent of your friends and family,” says hughes. most universities offer students such counselling and many run group sessions that specifically address loneliness.if recent research is to be believed, loneliness is killing the elderly and, with an ageing population, we should aim to reduce our isolation before it is too late. “getting older doesn’t have to mean getting lonelier,” says ruth sutherland, the chief executive of the relationship counselling service relate, in a new report. “but much of this rests on laying the foundations to good-quality relationships earlier in life.”
advanced	david cameron has declared a òclear resultó in the scottish independence referendum after scotland voted by a 10.6-point margin against ending the 307-year-old union with england and wales. the prime minister promised a devolution revolution across great britain, including votes on english issues by english mps at westminster, as he welcomed scotlandõs decision to remain inside the uk. òthere can be no disputes, no reruns ð we have heard the settled will of the scottish people,ó cameron said in a statementearlier, scotlandõs  rst minister, alex salmond, remained de ant at a downbeat scottish national party rally in edinburgh, saying he accepted scotland had not, òat this stageó, decided to vote for independence. he paid tribute to what he called a òtriumph for democratic politicsó and said he would work with westminster in the best interests of scotland and the rest of the uk ð warning the leaders of the three main parties to make good on their promises of enhanced devolution for scotland. òwe have touched sections of the community who have never before been touched by politics,ó he said.the yes campaign scored four big successes, winning 53% of the vote in scotlandõs largest city, glasgow, 57% in dundee and 51% in north lanarkshire. however, the no camp was victorious in 28 authorities. it won overwhelmingly in areas where it was expected to do well, including edinburgh, aberdeenshire and borders, but also in areas that could have gone to the yes campaign, including the western isles. in the  nal count, the no camp won 2,001,926 votes (55.3%) to 1,617,989 for yes (44.7%).in his speech, cameron made clear that the constitutional reforms, including in scotland, would not be delivered until after the general election, and that scottish measures would proceed in tandem with changes in england. òwe have heard the voice of scotland and, now, the millions of voices of england must be heard,ó he said.cameron added: òthe people of scotland have spoken and it is a clear result. they have kept our country of four nations together and, like millions of other people, i am delighted. as i said during the campaign, it would have broken my heart to see our united kingdom come to an end. and i know that sentiment was shared by people not just across our country but around the world because of what we have achieved together in the past and what we can do together in the future. so, now, it is time for our united kingdom to come together and to move forward. a vital part of that will be a balanced settlement, fair to people in scotland and, importantly, to everyone in england, wales and northern ireland, as well.óed miliband, the labour leader, said the referendum was a vote from the scottish people for change. òwe know our country needs to change in the way it is governed and we know our country needs to change in who it is governed for. we will deliver on stronger powers for a stronger scottish parliament, a strong scotland.ó but he said that would go beyond scotland. òwe will also meet the desire for change across england, across wales, across the whole of the united kingdom.ónick clegg, the deputy prime minister, said the referendum òmarks not only a new chapter for scotland within the uk but also wider constitutional reform across the unionó. echoing the snpõs argument, he said a vote against independence was òclearly not a vote against changeó. òwe must now deliver on time and in full the radical package of newly devolved powers to scotland,ó he added.yet that result raises the risk of further turmoil, with mps from cameronõs conservative party threatening to revolt against the prime ministerõs late and potentially vital promise to quickly increase the scottish parliamentõs powers while protecting its spending.the uk independence party leader, nigel farage, said cameronõs offer of more devolution for england did not go far enough. òthe english are 86% by population of this union. theyõve been left out of all of this for the last 18 years. we still have a situation where scottish mps can vote in the house of commons on english-only issues. i think what most english people want is a fair settlement,ó he said.cameron and the queen will both move to calm tensions when they deliver statements on the result. the prime minister will try, in the words of one cabinet minister, to òcement inó the no vote by outlining how he will deliver the deepening of scotlandõs devolution settlement, including handing greater powers over tax and welfare to the scottish parliament in edinburgh.the queen, who has monitored the referendum with interest, will make a written statement. it is understood that her remarks will focus on reconciliation. the prime minister wants to move fast to show that the three main uk party leaders will live up to their commitments made during the referendum campaign to deliver what the former prime minister gordon brown called òhome ruleó within the uk.ministers believe it is important to move quickly to avoid a repeat of the 1980 referendum in que_bec. the triumphalist behaviour of ontario fuelled the separatist cause that nearly succeeded in a second referendum in 1995.for the no campaign, there was relief: a spate of authoritative polls in the  nal days of the campaign had said the vote was on a knife-edge, bringing yes scotland within touching distance of victory after a dramatic surge in support.
advanced	a day that began with a fresh round of dawn raids on the baur au lac hotel in zurich ended with 16 football officials being indicted on corruption charges in the us, including five current or former members of fifa’s executive committee. they included the notorious former brazilian federation chief ricardo teixeira and his successor, marco polo del nero, who has recently stepped down from the fifa executive committee.they were among 16 individuals accused of fraud and other offences by the us department of justice as it set out a series of kickback schemes in a new 240-page indictment that superseded the previous one in may 2015. it takes to 27 the number of defendants charged by the us with a further 24 unnamed ‘co-conspirators’ including former fifa executive committee members. “the betrayal of trust set forth here is outrageous,” the us attorney general, loretta lynch, said. “the scale of corruption alleged herein is completely unacceptable.”on a day when fifa’s executive committee had hoped to present new reforms in the midst of an ongoing corruption crisis, swiss police led away the president of the south american football confederation, the paraguayan juan ángel napout, and alfredo hawit, the head of the north and central american and caribbean governing body. hawit only succeeded jeffrey webb in may 2015, after webb was arrested as part of the us operation that threw fifa into crisis and precipitated the downfall of sepp blatter. webb’s predecessor, the controversial jack warner, was also seized in may.the swiss federal office of justice said of the latest arrests: “they are being held in custody pending their extradition. according to the us arrest requests, they are suspected of accepting bribes of millions of dollars”. webb and the colombian former executive committee member luis bedoya were among those whose guilty pleas were entered in the us. lynch said that eight individuals, five of them unnamed in the original indictment, had come forward with guilty pleas since may.eleven current and former members of fifa’s executive committee have now been charged in the investigation, which alleges $200m in bribes, mainly as kickbacks from tv and marketing contracts but also fifa’s development programmes. the last three presidents of the regional bodies concacaf and conmebol have all been indicted.“the message from this announcement should be clear to every culpable individual who remains in the shadows, hoping to evade our investigation: you will not escape our focus,” said lynch. teixeira, the former son-in-law of the longstanding fifa president joão havelange, was charged alongside del nero and his predecessor, josé maria marin, who was charged in may.fourteen men had been charged in may 2015, when four additional guilty pleas were entered. days later, blatter won a fifth term as president but later agreed to step down as the crisis grew. he was then provisionally suspended alongside the uefa president, michel platini, over an alleged £1.3m “disloyal payment” to the frenchman. both men face possible life bans when their case is heard by the fifa ethics committee in december if they are found guilty of the charges.among those also charged on thursday were rafael salguero, a guatemalan who left the executive committee in may; the former south american confederation secretary general, eduardo deluca; peru’s former football federation president, manuel burga; and bolivia’s football president, carlos chaves, already jailed in his own country.lynch said: “the department of justice is committed to ending the rampant corruption we have described amidst the leadership of international football – not only because of the scale of the schemes alleged earlier and today, or the breadth of the operation required to sustain such corruption, but also because of the affront to international principles that this behaviour represents.”the acting fifa president, issa hayatou, refused to comment on the detail of the latest arrests. but he maintained neither he nor the organization was corrupt. appearing for the first time before the media since taking the role in september 2015, when blatter was suspended, hayatou responded in a similar way to his predecessors in improbably claiming the current crisis was down to a handful of errant individuals.“fifa is not corrupt. we have individuals that have shown negative behaviour. do not generalize the situation,” said hayatou, president of the confederation of african football for more than 25 years. “there are lots of people who have been in fifa for more than 20 or 30 years that have not been accused of anything.”
