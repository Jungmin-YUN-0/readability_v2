intermediate	according to a group of experts, bogus allergy tests are convincing thousands of people to take unnecessary treatments and put themselves or their children on inadequate diets. this can result in malnutrition. allergies and food intolerances are increasing rapidly but confusion between the two, as well as misdiagnosis, are causing real harm, said the charity sense about science, which has produced a guide with the help of allergy specialists.“it’s probably the biggest mess for science communication – there are myths, misinterpreted studies and bad medical practice. all this results in under- and over-diagnosis,” said tracey brown, director of sense about science. “the costs are huge – unnecessary actions for some and not enough action for those whose lives depend on it.”experts fear that restaurants and caterers hear so many people say that they have allergies (which can be dangerous for the individual), when in fact they have a food intolerance (which is not dangerous), that they may not take all the precautions they should take when serving a person who has a genuine allergy.“it matters very much,” said moira austin of a charity that supports people suffering from anaphylaxis. “if a caterer thinks somebody is just avoiding a food because they don’t want to get bloated, they may be less careful. there have been a number of fatalities where people have gone to a restaurant, told staff that they have an allergy to a particular food and the meal has been served up containing that allergen.”the guide says most internet and shop-bought allergy tests have no scientific basis. they include a home-testing kit that looks for specific immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies against foods in the blood. these antibodies are part of the immune system’s response to infections but “the best medical evidence has shown that high igg levels do not suggest an allergy,” the guide says. “results are often positive in people who do not have an allergy or a food intolerance.”also unscientific is another test, a mixture of acupuncture and homeopathy. it attempts to measure electronic resistance across the skin while the child or adult holds the suspect food in their hand. hair sample testing is also pointless, the guide says. “hair is not involved in allergic reactions so testing hair samples cannot provide any useful information on allergies.”“i commonly see children who have been put on to unnecessarily restricted diets. their parents assume, in good faith, that they have allergies to multiple foods because of ‘allergy tests’ that have no scientific basis,” said paul seddon, a paediatric allergist. “this needs to stop, which can only happen if we prove these ‘tests’ are unscientific.”another paediatric allergist, adam fox said: “i get a number of patients who come in after sending their hair off for analysis or after excluding a whole range of foods for their children. it is very difficult to deal with that. there are two challenges. children need to be given proper diets but it is the unnecessary avoidance of things that aren’t harmful that has a huge impact on the quality of life. a child who can’t eat wheat or drink milk can’t go to parties.”the belief that a child’s chronic lack of energy or headaches or eczema are caused by an allergy takes a long time and many tests to prove or disprove. it is tempting to go to an alternative therapist who will do one test and provide a quick, but wrong, answer.allergies are increasing in developed countries. the percentages of children diagnosed with allergic rhinitis and eczema have both trebled in the last 30 years. this is leading many more people to suspect allergies are the reason for their own or their children’s health problems. the guide lists a number of myths about the sources of allergies, from the suggestion that they are caused by e numbers in food colourings to “toxic overload” and fast food.
intermediate	back in 2005, when blackberry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone, the company was just entering its boom times. while the iphone was still just an idea, blackberry’s innovations ensured its smartphone was one of canada’s biggest exports.six years later, in the summer of 2011, when there were riots in london and other uk cities, blackberry messenger (bbm) was so effective at mobilizing the rioters that politicians wanted the service to be temporarily shut down. but, two years later, it is the users themselves who are pulling the plug.demand for blackberry phones is falling. dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place, from facebook’s and apple’s instant messaging applications to independent apps such as whatsapp and kik (which is also canadian). they are free to download and use, and they use the internet to swap text messages, pictures, voice clips, ‘stickers’ and even videos between most types of phones.in an attempt to keep its customers, bbm has been released on android and apple phones. despite the competition from other apps, the response has been extraordinary, with more than 20 million downloads. but, despite this interest, many people believe bbm’s wider release will not save the service. “the move to bring blackberry to the iphone is four or five years too late,” says james gooderson, an 18-year-old student who blogs on technology. “whatsapp has made blackberrys unnecessary for young people.”bbm says it has 80 million monthly users after its upgrade, but whatsapp has 300 million. other services show bbm’s limitations: unlike skype and viber, it does not yet offer video or voice calls; unlike path, it does not do location sharing; there is no video sharing, as on imessage; and the stickers (a more sophisticated version of the smiley face), adored by kids all over the world, are also absent. even the contacts and calendar sharing that bbm made possible on blackberry phones are not on the apple and android versions.messaging is moving from verbal to visual. photos uploaded to instagram get instant comments and snapchat’s pictures, which selfdelete after ten seconds, have opened a world of other possibilities. like bbm, all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection. but as recently as 2011, bbm was so powerful it helped to start a revolution in egypt; and at the time of the london riots, it was a more immediate source of news than the television screen.“we could see on our blackberry messages where the rioters were going next; tv news would catch up four hours later,” said jean- pierre moore, 28. he manages a youth club in stockwell, south london, an area with some of the highest levels of crime and poverty in britain. moore mainly communicates on an ipad now. he does not agree with the idea that a shutdown of bbm would have stopped the looting. “the social networking wasn’t the reason,” he says.nearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application but two-thirds use more than one. among 16- to 24-year-olds, 60% use facebook every day, but 46% use alternatives. “it’s a much more complex, multifaceted environment,” says benedict evans, a digital media specialist. “all of these apps use your smartphone – they plug into your phone book and your photo library. apps rise and fall like fireworks. some, like instagram, last; others just disappear.”thirteen-year-old bennett has three phones. he keeps his blackberry for messaging, uses an iphone to play games, and makes phone calls on an android phone. his friends are still on bbm. at the touch of a few buttons, a single blackberry message can be sent to the phone owner’s entire contacts book – several hundred people, in some cases; on whatsapp, the limit for a broadcast message is 50. but, for bennett, instagram is now a major social network. “instagram is facebook without parents,” he says. “facebook has been taken over by the older generation. when i saw my mum on facebook, i deleted my account.”the low cost of buying and communicating on a blackberry is still an advantage. unlimited bbm messages are available to anyone with a secondhand was a belief that encrypted words sent over the company’s secure servers could not be traced back to their writers. arrests and prosecutions after the riots put an end to that belief. phone and a £7-a-month deal from a telecoms company. but people no longer trust the privacy of bbm. part of the attraction to business people, revolutionaries, demonstrators and riotersacross town from stockwell, outside the gates of a private school in the rich district of south kensington, the older pupils all have apple logos on their phones. they all use whatsapp. for many, bbm is a distant memory. “i still have a blackberry, but i’m the only one,” says a teenager standing with a circle of friends. and how does that make him feel? “isolated,” he replies.
intermediate	according to american researchers, a nasal spray containing the ‘love hormone’ oxytocin could help children with autism behave more normally in social situations. scans of autistic children showed that a single dose of the chemical improved brain responses to facial expressions. this is something that could make social interactions feel more natural and rewarding for them.the researchers said oxytocin might increase the success of behavioural therapies that are already used to help people with autism learn to cope with social situations. “over time, what you would expect to see is more normal social responding, being more interested in interacting with other people, more eye contact and more conversation,” said kevin pelphrey, of yale university.autism is a developmental disorder that more than one in 100 people have. the condition affects people in different ways, but leads to difficulties in social interaction and communication. so far, there is no established treatment for the social problems caused by autism.researchers at yale have studied the brain chemical oxytocin as a possible treatment for the social problems caused by autism because it plays an important role in bonding and trust. results have been mixed, though: one recent study found no significant benefit for young people given the chemical over several days. but pelphrey said oxytocin might help the brain learn from social interactions; it would work best when used with therapies that encourage people with autism to interact more socially, he said.the scientists scanned the brains of 17 young people aged eight to 16 with autism while they looked at images of cars or the eyes of people expressing different emotions. the scans were given 45 minutes after the young people inhaled a placebo or oxytocin through a nasal spray.the scans showed that the reward circuits in the children’s brains behaved more normally after a dose of oxytocin: that is, they were more active when the person was looking at faces and less active when looking at the inanimate cars. the study appears in the latest issue of the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences in the united states.“the study suggests that oxytocin might treat something for which we don’t have a treatment in autism, and that’s the core social motivation,” said pelphrey. he warned that it was too early to use oxytocin as a treatment for the social difficulties caused by autism and said people should not buy oxytocin online. “we don’t want them trying oxytocin at home. it’s impossible to say what they are buying. we are nowhere near thinking this is a ready treatment. it needs more follow-up,” he said. “this is an important new study in identifying changes in brain activity in key areas of the brain,” said simon baron-cohen, director of the autism research centre at cambridge university.a surprising finding, however, is that oxytocin nasal spray did not change performance in social recognition tasks. and, it is also not yet clear if oxytocin only has benefits for people with autism or has any unwanted side effects. finally, oxytocin effects only last about 45 minutes, so there may be practical considerations as to whether this could be used as a treatment.“from a scientific perspective, this study has a lot of evidence from animal and human work to justify serious attention, but more research is needed. doctors should be cautious about the potential of this hormone until we know much more about its benefits and risks, in much larger studies.” said simon baron-cohen.uta frith, who studies autism at university college london, said: “according to this study, oxytocin may have the effect of making faces more interesting. disappointingly, this effect is seen only in brain activity and not in behaviour. demonstrating an effect on behaviour will be critical if nasal spray treatment is to be of any value.”nan
intermediate	‘fit in four minutes’ sounds like a headline from a health magazine or an impossible promise on late-night satellite tv. then you try dr izumi tabata’s training programme – 20 seconds of allout effort, ten seconds of rest, repeat eight times – and, after collapsing on the floor, you realize you were wrong.tabata has seen it all before. “they were dead!” he laughs as he remembers the first time he tried out his system on his university students in the early 1990s. “after four minutes’ hard exercise they were completely exhausted. but after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised. we all were.”he began his research after he watched japan’s speed skating team in the early 1990s – he noticed that short bursts of incredibly hard exercise seemed to be at least as effective as hours of moderate training. tabata tried to prove this with a simple experiment. one group of moderately trained students did an hour of steady cardiovascular exercise on an exercise bike five times a week. the other group did a ten-minute warm-up on the bike, followed by four minutes of tabata training, four times a week – plus one 30-minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of tabata.the results were very surprising. after six weeks of testing, the group following tabata’s plan – exercising for just 88 minutes a week – had increased their anaerobic capacity by 28% and their vo2 max, something that shows your cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power, by 15%. the control group, who trained for five hours every week, also improved their vo2 max, but by 10% – and their training had no effect on anaerobic capacity.”we also measured increases in heart size after three weeks of doing the exercises,” says tabatabut you have to work very, very hard. you can’t sit on a cross trainer, chewing gum and reading the latest issue of hello! the programme demands intensive bursts on a stationary bike or rowing machine; explosive bodyweight exercises, sprints and so on. remember how you felt after doing a 100m sprint at school? imagine doing eight of them with only a tensecond break to recover.“all-out effort at 170% of your vo2 max is the basis of the programme,” says tabata. “if you feel ok afterwards, you’ve not done it properly. the first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossibly hard. in the original plan the aim was to get to eight, but some only managed six or seven.”one person on an online forum wrote: “when done correctly you should meet god. most people are incapable of doing it correctly and shouldn’t even try.” tabata doesn’t completely agree. “everyone can do it but beginners should start with educated trainers so that they can work at the correct intensity for them,” he explains. he adds that his programme burns an extra 150 calories in the 12 hours after exercise, even at rest. so, although it is used by most people to get fit – or by fit people to get even fitter – it also burns fat.it’s slightly surprising, therefore, that only serious athletes follow the programme at the moment. but that may change now that tabata has agreed a deal that will lead to a network of instructors and a dvd range released towards the end of the year. “i decided to do this because i often go on youtube and, while i am pleased that people are doing it, some are doing it wrong because they don’t realize how hard they need to work,” says tabata.so should we all start following this plan? richard scrivener, a former rugby fitness coach, says that while the benefits are clear, tabatas are an addition, not a replacement, to a favoured sport or training method. “runners, for instance, need a high level of running economy, which comes from learning the skills and running for many miles,” says scrivener, “but they could reduce the number of long runs and the overall mileage by introducing tabata training. this will give joints the chance to rest and recover, especially if you have a history of injuries – and you would probably therefore get more benefit from the long runs when you do them.”gym rats can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three tabatas a week. and the rest of us can slowly increase the number of sessions, although we know that it will never get easier because every session needs maximum effort. that’s the cruel genius of the programme: it is hard – and effective.nannan
intermediate	as soon as the children at one primary school in stirling, scotland, hear the words òdaily mileó, they put down their pencils and leave the classroom to start running around the school  eld. for three-and-a-half years, all the pupils at st ninianõs primary school have walked or run a mile each day. they do it at different times during the day and, despite the rise in childhood obesity across the uk, none of the children at the school are overweight.the daily mile has done so much to improve these childrenõs  tness, behaviour and concentration in lessons that many other british schools are doing the same. they are getting pupils to get up from their desks and take 15 minutes to walk or run round the school or local park.elaine wyllie, headteacher of st ninianõs, said: òi get at least two emails a day from other schools and local authorities asking how we do it. the thought of children across the country running every day because of something weõve done is phenomenal.one in ten children are obese when they start school at the age of four or  ve, according to the health & social care information centre, and, in the summer of 2015, a study found that schoolchildren in england are the least  t they have ever been. primary schools therefore accept the bene ts of the daily mile. it has been introduced in schools in various parts of the uk and other schools are planning to launch the initiative during the 2015-16 academic year. in stirling alone, 30 schools have already started or will soon start the daily mile.òitõs a common-sense approach to childrenõs  tness, which is free and easy. the most important thing is that the children really enjoy it; otherwise, you couldnõt sustain it. they come back inside bright-eyed and rosy-cheeked, how children used to look,ó said wyllie. at st ninianõs, teachers take their pupils out of lessons to a specially built circuit around the schoolõs playing  eld for their daily mile whenever it best suits that dayõs timetable. only ice or very heavy rain stop them.the extent of the bene ts isnõt known yet but researchers from stirling university have launched a comparative study to look for evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile. dr colin moran, who is leading the study, said: òthe children donõt seem to have problems with obesity; they seem happier and staff say they settle into lessons faster so we designed a study that would test all of these things.ó st ninianõs pupils will be compared with children from another school in stirling that hasnõt yet started the scheme.kevin clelland, a primary school teacher from leeds, visited st ninianõs and, then, convinced his colleagues it was a great idea. he said: òitõs such a simple thing to do but seems to have such an amazing impact. weõre really committed to improving the  tness of our pupils.ó his school is now building a track.active cheshire, a sports and  tness organization in cheshire, is taking a group of senior people from the local authority up to scotland to assess the results of the daily mile. the hope is to introduce it across the 450 schools in their region if a pilot programme is successful.paralympian, tanni grey-thompson, chair of ukactive, a health organization for physical activity, said: òall children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day, whether in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground. itõs fantastic to see initiatives like the daily mile, showing real leadership from the education sector to improve childrenõs  tness levels and their cognitive behaviour, and make a real difference to schools, teachers, parents and young peopleõs lives. we know sitting still kills; not sitting still helps children build skills that will stay with them for life.óthe scottish government also supports the initiative. a spokesperson said: òlearning in pe is enhanced by initiatives like the daily mile, which can encourage and support parents in fostering healthy habits with their children from a young age. we are pleased to see so many scottish schools are taking part or planning to do so.ó
intermediate	the problem with google glasses, says takahito iguchi, is that they’re not cool. he may be right. there’s already a website dedicated to people wearing them looking either ridiculous or smug or, more often, both. search google images and one of the first hits is a picture of a large, naked man wearing them in the shower. and it’s this that iguchi, a japanese entrepreneur, hopes may be google’s achilles’ heel. he is launching a competitor that is a bit more stylish. a bit more blade runner. a bit more japanese.iguchi’s augmented reality glasses aren’t really glasses – they are more a single piece of metal with a camera and a tiny projector. they are called telepathy one and, since they were presented to the public for the first time in austin, texas, they have attracted $5m of venture capital. like glass, telepathy one is due to launch in 2014.it’s a simplified version of google glass. glass has a range of uses – you can surf the internet, read emails, take photographs – but telepathy will be “more of a communication device”. connected via bluetooth to your phone, it will focus on real-time visual and audio sharing. you’ll be able to post photos and videos from your line of vision on facebook or send them as an email, or see and speak to a video image of a friend.“it will help bring you close to your friends and family. we are very focused on the communication and sharing possibilities,” says iguchi, who has worked in the japanese technology industry for 20 years.of course, not everyone wants to get closer to the man in the futuristic headset, i tell him. iguchi shakes his head. “i’m a visionary. i have a dream that people will understand other people. when i go to london, i am a stranger. sometimes i feel fear. but i believe that everyone wants to be understood and to understand each other. and, with this device, you can know more information about people before you even speak to them.”compared to google, telepathy is a minnow, but iguchi doesn’t seem to worry. in his shared office space in san francisco – a cool, converted warehouse – he quotes sun tzu’s the art of war and says that even tiny armies can sometimes beat powerful forces. when he was growing up, japanese technology ruled the world: the sony walkman was the iphone of its day. now, to compete, he’s had to leave tokyo and go to silicon valley.“tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture but it’s still an island. it’s isolated. there is not any way to expand. whereas, in silicon valley, everyone is from everywhere. it’s where you come to connect globally.” the hardware will be made in japan, and he is putting together a team of software engineers in the us to develop its applications.building the prototype of telepathy one was easy, iguchi says. “we have every sort of technology in tokyo. it is presenting it to the world that is the challenge.” the top manufacturers all want to work with him, he says, because they have the technology, they just struggle to sell it. “there needs to be a story to the product. like apple did with the ipod – 1,000 songs in your pocket. and steve jobs was inspired by akio morita, the co-founder of sony, and he inspired me, so maybe it will come in a circle.”maybe. he certainly has the confidence of jobs, but, with a thick japanese accent, he sometimes struggles to make himself understood, a fact that may have contributed to his idea for telepathy one. when he went to london to present the headset, he stayed in an airbnb. “the house owner was not my friend but i talked with him for three hours, and now he is my friend. that is how long it takes to understand each other, to share our feelings, and background, and career. maybe telepathy makes that quicker. if you are getting info from the cloud and social networks, that will happen more easily.”iguchi hopes that seeing somebody else’s i suddenly realized that everything is code. everything is coded and is shareable between humans. and everything can be encoded and decoded. and, if code is exchangeable between humans, that will end all war.” literal point of view will help you to see their metaphorical point of view. as a student, he explains, he studied philosophy by day and taught himself how to code by night. “and, one day, i opened the door of my apartment and
intermediate	emmanuel limal used online dating sites a lot but he was tired of meeting women who weren’t ready to start a family, or at least wouldn’t admit that they were. the 43-yearold actor, originally from france, had spent 20 years living in copenhagen and looking for love in the hope of raising children. he tried to find someone online but was dismayed by the results.“i got frustrated with everyone saying they were really active, always travelling or with a long list of hobbies, but no mention of children,” limal said. “on some sites, there was an option to click saying: ‘i’d like kids someday,’ but you would read the person’s profile and think: ‘you will never have time!’ if someone’s going to the gym eight times a week and travelling every month, they are not putting a family first.”limal has a six-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, but coming from a big family – his father is one of 11 – he has always wanted more children. “i couldn’t seem to meet anyone willing to prioritize starting a family”. he said it was difficult to know when to mention wanting kids when he met someone new. “it’s the ultimate dating taboo,” he said. “then one day i read a profile from a 38-year-old who said she knew it was ‘really bad to admit’ but she wanted children. and i just thought: ‘you shouldn’t be ashamed of this.’”limal borrowed money to pay for the setting up of babyklar.nu – or ‘baby-ready now’ in english. it works like a normal dating site but everyone is asked to be honest about their wish to start a family soon. “we ask people if they are ok with someone who already has children and if they want another baby,” limal said. “but we don’t make them say how many children they’d like. that would be a bit too much like grocery shopping online.”he has had a very positive response to the site. “we had 50 sign-ups an hour when we started in june and we are already hearing from couples who have met through the site and are now together. i’m fully expecting the first babyklar.nu baby by next summer.” more men have signed up than women (53% to 47%), with comments such as “it’s so lovely to be able to say this out loud” and “i finally dare to be honest about what i want.”the site has come at the right time for the country of five million people. danes are not having enough babies, according to a report from the copenhagen hospital rigshospitalet, and the current rate of 1.7 children per family is not enough to maintain denmark’s population. the usual reasons are given – women are leaving it “too late” and couples are living together without getting married and waiting to start families.“now, i hope, men and women who want to start a family but haven’t met the right person yet will have another option,” says limal. he says that this isn’t just about baby farming: “i want this to be about children and love. my goal is to pair up people who really want a family and a partner – and who’ll stay together. i’m a romantic at heart.”there are plans to launch the site in france and the uk later in 2013, but for now it is the danes who are benefitting from it. “danes have no problem having children before marriage so things can move fast and, because the country’s so small, a jutlander can date a copenhagener without too much travel,” limal said. what’s more, limal has finally found love. “i’ve met a nice woman and she wants a baby too – so we shall see.”
intermediate	he had the tastes of a typical millionaire. he owned a gold and silver rolex and lots of expensive cars. he liked to buy modern art. but, although this chinese businessman had several companies and a large villa in madrid, he had almost no money in the bank. this detail interested the spanish authorities.gao ping supplied 4,000 chinese bazaars across spain. but, authorities suspected he was not paying taxes on the clothes, furniture and other goods he was importing from china.when police searched his warehouses in 2012 they found piles of cash: €100, €200 and €500 notes were wrapped in elastic bands. around €12m was taken away, the largest amount of cash ever found by spanish police. gao’s gang is accused of laundering up to €300m a year, as well as selling counterfeit goods and toys with fake safety marks.law enforcement officials have been worried about €500 notes for a long time. small and easy to transport relative to their value, they are the payment method that tax dodgers, money launderers and drug barons prefer to use. the sum of €1m in €500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag. the same amount in €50 notes would need a small suitcase.the uk stopped distribution of the €500 note in 2010 because it was used “almost entirely by criminals”. in 2009, italy’s central bank warned that the notes were widely used by mafia money launderers and terrorists. other countries have limited their own high-denomination notes due to links to organized crime – canada got rid of its $1,000 note in 2000 on the advice of law enforcement officers.now, with electronic payment systems and contactless cards, people are asking whether we should print these notes. peter sands, the former head of standard chartered bank, said we should get rid of high-denomination notes, including the €500, the $100, the 1,000 swiss franc note and the £50. in a report for the harvard kennedy school of government, sands said it was time to get rid of high-value notes that make life easier for “bad guys”. criminals would instead use smaller-denomination bills, or gold or diamonds, but these are too big to be carried easily and more traceable. this makes it more likely they will get caught, he said.at a conference on terrorist financing in london, the head of europol, rob wainwright, asked the european central bank to look at whether it “should continue to produce these notes that make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide their business and to provide money for illegal activities”. according to europol, the purple €500 note makes up 30% of the value of all the euro notes, although most people have never seen one.the €500 note was introduced in 2002 when the euro was born: it replaced the 1,000 deutschmark, the 10,000 belgian franc and the 500,000 italian lira. in germany and austria, more than half of all transactions are still made with paper money and coins.europol would like to see central banks take more responsibility for what happens with €500 notes. luxembourg, for example, issued more than twice its annual gdp in banknotes in 2013 alone. europol asked luxembourg’s central bank to explain. the reply from luxembourg was that they simply issue the notes that are asked for and do not ask or know why people want them, said jennifer macleod, a specialist in europol’s financial intelligence group. “i find it surprising that a central bank does not consider itself to have a responsibility in this area.”this could be changing. eu finance ministers have asked policymakers to think about “appropriate limits” on high-value notes and report back by 1 may 2016.nannan
intermediate	brazil’s latest funk sensation, anitta, has won millions of fans by making the favela sound popular, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour.anti-discrimination campaigners and social commentators say the music industry’s fastest rising star has had to give up her blackness to be a success in the predominantly white middle-class market.the controversy began with the publication of then-and-now photographs that show a dramatic lightening of anitta’s skin tone since she signed a deal with warner.in the first photo, when she was quite unknown, she looked darker. in the second – a marketing photo after she became famous – she seems lighter. the contrast has restarted discussion about whether you need to have light skin to get ahead in brazil.jarid arraes, a psychology student and blogger, wrote a post criticizing the discrimination in media and marketing that she felt anitta’s image change represented. “people refuse to accept that they are racist and they think they live in a multiracial democracy, but the statistics show that is far from the case. white is the image of the rich, the nice, the successful, the good, while people see black as the opposite of all that.”born larissa de macedo machado, the diva-to-be was a church chorister in her childhood. in her teens, she made a name for herself in rio de janeiro’s baile funk scene as a dancer and singer.she now has an album and a huge hit single, show das poderosas, which topped the charts and attracted 52 million youtube views.many people love her because she is a pop idol with a strong message and some catchy tunes. her marketing team want people to see her as a cultural bridge between the predominantly black and mixed-race shanty towns on rio’s hillsides and the wealthier and whiter communities below.gangsta references and explicit lyrics of baile funk. now, however, questions are being asked about whether she – or her marketing team – have gone too far in changing her. arraes says that if pop stars have curly hair, they will want to straighten it. if they have a big nose, they will want to make it smaller. it creates a vicious cycle for how you feel about yourself.this is a sensitive topic in this largely mixed-raced nation. brazil – one of the last big countries in the world to ban slavery – has the largest population of african descent outside africa, but race and where your family come from are less important there than colour. there is a clear link between skin tone and inequality.in brazilian cities, white workers earn roughly twice as much as those of african descent. up until 2011, black or mixed-race students also spent two years less at school on average.most business and government executives are white, while most menial jobs are done by black and mixed-race workers. if you walk through ipanema, gávea or other rich districts, you are far more likely to see black nannies pushing strollers with white children than a white nanny pushing a black child.defining colour is complex. people who define themselves as white were in the minority for the first time in the most recent census in 2010. among the 197 million population, 82 million said they were “pardu” (mixed race), 15 million black, two million asian and 0.5% indigenous.sylvio ferreira, a psychology lecturer at the federal university of pernambuco, believes anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it more acceptable to everyone.maycon de mattos batista, a financial analyst who worked with anitta while she was an intern, said there had been a huge change in anitta’s image, but not of her colour.“i don’t believe it’s whitening; it’s more the way they are producing her with makeup, hairstylists and the way she dresses,” he said. “i don’t think that was because of pressure they put on her. she always liked to show off, sing and dance. that was a natural thing for her. i believe that it is because of this naturalness that she is where she is today.”nannannannan
intermediate	scarlett johansson is suing a french novelist for û50,000. she says that his work of  ction makes fraudulent claims about her personal life.la premiere chose quon regarde (the first thing we look at) by gregoire delacourt tells the story of a french model who looks so similar to the american actor that the books lead male character thinks it is johansson herself. in the novel, the models looks mean that men see her only as a sex object, while women are jealous of her. she has a series of adventures as johansson and, in the end, dies in a car crash.johansson does not feel  attered by the best- selling book. her lawyer, vincent toledano, told le figaro that delacourtõs novel illegally used ms johanssonõs name, her reputation and her image. he said the novel contains òdefamatory claims about her private life.ó he has now gone to court to try to stop the book being translated or adapted for cinema.delacourt tried to explain that he chose to mention johansson because she is òthe archetype of beauty today.ó he said: òi wrote a work of  ction. my character is not scarlett johansson.óon french radio, the author recently said the legal action was òrather sadó. he said: òit freaks me out to think that when you talk of a character in a novel, judges can get involved.ódelacourt is one of franceõs best-loved authors; his previous novel, my list of desires, was translated into 47 languages and is now being adapted into a  lm. but he said he was òspeechlessó when he found out johansson was suing him.òi thought sheõd get in contact to ask me to go for a coffee with her. i didnõt write a novel about a celebrity,ó he said. òi wrote a real love story about feminine beauty, especially interior beauty.òif an author can no longer mention the things that surround us ð a brand of beer, a monument, an actor ð itõs going to be complicated to produce  ction.òiõm not sure sheõs even read the novel because it hasnõt been translated yet.óemmanuelle allibert, spokeswoman for publisher jc latte_s, said taking legal action was òcrazyó. òwe have never known anything like it. it is all the more surprising because the novel is not even about scarlett johansson. it is about a woman who is scarlett johanssonõs double.óironically, the authorõs legal situation would be far easier if he had published the book in johanssonõs home country, rather than france. lloyd jassin, a new york lawyer, said that the case would most likely not go to court in the united states because the book would be protected by the first amendment.he said that, if thereõs signi cance and literary merit to using her name in the book, the first amendment would protect the authorõs right to do so. however, in france, the legal position is more complicated and personality rights are taken òmuch more seriously,ó jassin says.òi thought she might send me  owers as the book was a declaration of love for her, but she didnõt understand,ó delacourt said.nannan
elementary	a menu scandal at some of japan’s top hotels and department stores is damaging the international reputation of japanese food.one luxury hotel group admitted that it lied about ingredients on its menus. since then, there have been similar stories from restaurants run by famous hotels and department stores in japan.the story began when the hankyu-hanshin hotel group admitted that it gave false descriptions of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and october 2013.for example, the red salmon ‘caviar’ that customers ordered was in fact the eggs of the flying fish.the hotel group’s president, hiroshi desaki, went on television to announce a 20% pay cut for himself and 10% for other executives. but this did not make customers less angry.days later, desaki resigned – he said that the hotel group had betrayed their customers.so far, the company has refunded 20 million yen to more than 10,000 consumers. in total, they will refund 110 million yen.customers who believed they ate expensive kuruma shrimps were told they in fact ate much cheaper black tiger shrimps.complained in a blogpost that a ‘scallop’ dish he ordered at the prince hotel in tokyo contained a similar, but cheaper, type of shellfish.the hotel investigated the complaint and as a result corrected more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants. its report scared hankyu-hanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they, too, lied to customers who believed they were paying high prices for top ingredients.the hotel okura group – where barack obama has stayed – said they also injected beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly described tomatoes as organic.“we apologize for lying to our clients,” it said.the list of fraudulent ingredients gets bigger: orange juice from cartons that was sold as freshly squeezed; mont blanc desserts with korean chestnuts instead of the french ones on the menu; shop-bought chocolate cream that the menu said was home-made; imported beef sold as expensive wagyu beef.the menu scandal has come at the wrong time. japan is trying to persuade south korea and other countries to start to buy japanese food again after the fukushima nuclear accident.food industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 forced luxury hotels to save money.“menu descriptions were created to sound good to the customers, and, when hotels couldn’t get the ingredients on the menu, they just used food from different places,” hiroshi tomozawa, a hotel and restaurant consultant, told kyodo news.nannannannannannan

elementary	people today might not hear the sounds of the natural world because they screen out the noises around them, says a us researcher.more background noise can make people oblivious to the uplifting sounds of birdsong, water and trees in the wind. you can often hear these sounds even in cities, said kurt fristrup, a senior scientist at the us national park service.the problem is even worse because people listen to music through their earphones instead of listening to the birds and other sounds of nature. natural sounds are easily drowned out by traf c, music and others noises, fristrup said.òthis learned deafness is a real problem,ó fristrup told the american association for the advancement of science meeting in san jose. òwe are training ourselves to ignore the information that comes into our ears.òthis gift that we are born with ð the ability to hear things hundreds of metres away, all these incredible sounds ð might be lost,ó he said.this is the problem: we hear so many noises that we stop listening.for the past ten years, the us national park service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 parks in the us, including yosemite in california, yellowstone and denali in alaska. there was noise from human activity in all the parks, for example aircraft, motorbikes, motorboats and tour buses.fristrupõs team say that noise pollution more than doubles every 30 years. òitõs not surprising people put on earphones,ó he said.òmore background noise has the same effect on your hearing as fog has on your vision ð you are aware of only a small area around you,ó he said. even in our cities, there are birds and things to appreciate in the environment but we are losing the ability to hear them.people quickly become used to changes in their environments, including more noise. fristrup worries that we will forget how much quieter the world could be. òif  nding peace and quiet becomes too dif cult, many children will grow up without the experience and i think itõs a very big problem,ó he said.other scientists reported health bene ts from listening to natural sounds. speaking at the same meeting, derrick taff, a social scientist at pennsylvania state university, said that listening to recordings from national parks, of waterfalls, birdsong and wind, helped people feel less stressed.òwe know that natural sounds are very important to people. they are some of the main reasons people visit protected areas. they want to hear the natural quiet, the birdsong, and the wind and water,ó taff said. òwe may be losing this as people are listening to their ipods all the time. my advice is to go to your protected areas and experience what you are missing.ónannannan
elementary	james bond films are one of the world’s oldest and most successful film series. twenty-three bond films have been made so far. they have earned more than $6 billion at cinemas around the world. james bond is not slowing down. in fact, the films are more popular than ever – skyfall, which broke all records and became the biggest ever film at uk cinemas in 2012, earned a total of $1.1 billion.so, there was a lot of interest when they announced more details about the 24th bond film – especially its title, spectre. the number one question is: can spectre be as successful as skyfall?charles gant, film editor for heat magazine, thinks it can. “they were very clever when they made skyfall,” he says. “it was both modern and retro. daniel craig fans liked it and, also, older, more nostalgic bond fans, who lost interest over the previous few films. with the new title,” he adds, “it is certain to be a success.”eon productions is the company, started in 1961, that made dr no and all the “official” bond films. the company really wants the next film to be successful so it is using the same people that worked on skyfall in the new film. daniel craig will play bond and the same people have written the script. most importantly, sam mendes will again be the director. according to gant, mendes is the best bond director. gant says: “mendes attracted top actors like ralph fiennes. actors like fiennes will only be in a film if they like the director.”the bond series was not in trouble before the arrival of mendes – and craig – but the films were becoming a bit boring towards the end of pierce brosnan’s time as bond. there were no longer any more original bond stories to adapt and the films no longer had enough energy.this was nothing new: the history of the bond series has been one of constant change, especially of the lead actor: first, sean connery; then, george lazenby, roger moore, timothy dalton, brosnan and, now, craig. each new actor has been different and some have been better than others.lazenby only did one bond film. dalton’s two films, the living daylights and licence to kill, were during a period in the late 80s when more aggressive hollywood action movies were more popular. according to gant, “the period of roger moore’s last films and dalton’s films didn’t excite audiences. brosnan was more successful but craig is the best. on the other hand, the early bond films were sexy and exciting.”skyfall made more money than all the other bond films. but some of the 1960s bond films were almost as successful. with figures adjusted for inflation, the 1965 film thunderball is only a little bit below skyfall. and goldfinger and you only live twice both did better than the other craig films. licence to kill made the least money of all bond films and moore’s final film, a view to a kill, the second least.martin campbell is an experienced british director and he planned one of the most elaborate stunts in bond history. in the famous first scene of goldeneye (released in 1995), bond falls into a light aeroplane without a pilot. this scene helped to make the bond series more modern and popular. also, a very successful goldeneye video game created new, younger fans of bond and made people think that the bond film was no longer boring and old-fashioned.nannannannannan
elementary	mcdonaldõs is the worldõs biggest burger chain and a symbol of american consumer capitalism. but, these days, the golden arches of mcdonaldõs are not looking so golden. the company has got much bigger since 2003 but, now, the numbers of customers are falling. mcdonaldõs says that its worldwide sales have fallen by 3.3%.the company has problems almost everywhere. in china, sales fell by 23%. in europe, sales fell by 4%, mostly because of problems in ukraine and the anti-western mood in russia. health inspectors have investigated around 200 of mcdonaldõs 450 restaurants in russia and they have closed ten restaurants.but the worst crisis is in the us, where mcdonaldõs has around 40% of its restaurants. almost 60 years since ray kroc opened his  rst restaurant in des plaines, illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a big mac and fries. sales have fallen every month for 12 months in the us. many younger diners are eating at rival companies such as chipotle mexican grill. the number of 19-to-21-year-olds who visit mcdonaldõs once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011.another problem is that mcdonaldõs hamburgers were recently named the worst in america in a poll of more than 32,000 american diners ð they said they would rather eat a burger at five guys, smashburger or fuddruckers. many people also believe that mcdonaldõs is less healthy than most of its rivals, especially chipotle. chipotle uses antibiotic-free meat and òlocally sourced, seasonaló ingredients.mcdonaldõs asked customers for their opinions in the us in october. someone asked òhave you ever used pink slime in your burgers?ó ð ôpink slimeõ is the beef  ller that is used for dog food. mcdonaldõs stopped using this meat product in 2012 but mcdonaldõs chief executive don thompson said the company still had to improve peopleõs opinions about the freshness and quality of its ingredients.mcdonaldõs has always had a reputation for fast service at low prices. but, since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, people think it is more expensive than its rivals and many consumers complain that service is slower.but mary chapman at food analysts technomic said that it wasnõt fair to say that mcdonaldõs was more expensive than its rivals. òprices have gone up but they havenõt gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-food chains in the us.ó prices at mcdonaldõs have increased by 4.8% since 2009, much less than the fast-food average (up 19.4%).but people are right when they complain that the queues are longer. mcdonaldõs has a bigger menu than some other restaurants, with more complicated items ð its chicken mcwrap takes 60 seconds to make. òi think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not,ó said chapman.mcdonald managers are promising to improve peopleõs opinions about its food in the us. thompson has promised more organic food and òbuild your own burgersó. but, to reduce queues, he also wants to introduce simpler menus. how can the company have simpler menus and, at the same time, a larger selection of  llings? òthey want to simplify the menu but also offer ôbuild your own burgersõ ð that sounds tricky,ó said consumer expert mark kalinowski. only four out of mcdonaldõs 14,000 us restaurants have tested òbuild your own burgeró, he said. òright now, we are sceptical; we would like to see more detail.ósales are falling but mcdonaldõs continues to expand around the world: by the end of 2014, it expects to open 1,400 new restaurants. kalinowski thinks that mcdonaldõs sales will continue to fall but he thinks it will be number one for many years.nannannan

elementary	water scientists have given a very strong warning about the world’s food supplies. they say that everyone may have to change to a vegetarian diet by 2050.we believe there will be an extra two billion people in the world by 2050. humans get about 20% of their protein from animal-based products now, but this may need to decrease to just 5% to feed these extra people, say the world’s top water scientists.“there will not be enough water to produce food for the nine-billion population in 2050 if more people start eating like people in the west,” the report by malik falkenmark and colleagues at the stockholm international water institute (siwi) said.“there will be enough water if the percentage of animal-based foods is limited to 5% of total calories.”there are warnings that water shortages will limit food production. at the same time, oxfam and the un prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years. prices for food items such as corn and wheat have increased nearly 50% on international markets since june. the price increase has been caused by very bad droughts in the us and russia, and weak monsoon rains in asia. more than 18 million people already have serious food shortages across the sahel.oxfam says that the effects of price increases will be very bad in developing countries that need to buy food from other countries, including parts of latin america, north africa and the middle east. food shortages in 2008 led to fighting in 28 countries.changing to a vegetarian diet is one way to keep more water to grow food, the scientists said. animal protein-rich food uses five to ten times more water than vegetarian food. one third of the world’s farmland is used to grow crops to feed animals.“nine hundred million people already don’t have enough food and two million people are malnourished, even though we are producing more food,” they said. “70% of all water is used in farming, and growing more food to feed an extra two billion people by 2050 will put more pressure on water and land.”the report was released at the start of the annual world water conference in stockholm, sweden, where 2,500 politicians, un groups, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries met to discuss global water supply problems.eating too much, malnourishment and waste are all increasing. “we will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future,” said the report’s editor, anders jägerskog.nannannannannan
elementary	not many exercise classes have a tea break in the middle. but margaret allen’s class has one. after a gentle warm-up and a few quick exercises, the 93-year-old great-grandmother lets her group sit down and relax with a cup of tea. some of the eight people in the class look like they need a break, but allen is not even sweating.the general rule is that eating just before doing sport is not a good idea and especially not halfway through the class. but, on the afternoon i visit allen’s class in saltburnby- the-sea, they eat fruitcake during the break. the cake was made for allen’s recent birthday by her 89-year-old sister, joan.the ladies have just finished their cake when allen gets up again. she plays a lively scottish song and there is lots of toe pointing and leg kicking. forty-five minutes later, the class is finally over.allen has been leading classes in the north-east town for 45 years. she wasn’t very sporty at school, but she started playing the piano for a keep-fit class during the second world war and started leading the class in her 40s when the old instructor retired.at one time, allen’s class had more than 18 regulars, each paying £1 a time. but, these days, the group is getting smaller. during the tea break, the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them went to that week for one of the younger people in the group who died recently, aged 68.allen is the oldest, her sister the second oldest. the baby of the group is 60-year-old jean cunion, who is a bit embarrassed to say that she is perhaps the least fit of the group. “i remember, the first time i came, margaret said, ‘who’s that breathing heavily?’ and i had to say it was me.” ruth steere, 76, says allen always has her back to the class, but she always knows what’s happening: “she always shouts at us if we go wrong. she’s very good at knowing what we are doing.”allen, who loves dancing, has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor. instead, she got ideas for her own moves from five fitness videos from the bbc. allen thinks she is healthy because she keeps busy, especially since her husband died in 1997. she started writing poetry when she was 80.“i write poems about everything. i just can’t stop,” she says, when she phones me a few days after the interview to read out a poem she has written about the joys of exercise. she still plays the piano and gives speeches. she also did a computer course when she was 88.ageing is no fun, she says. she reads me a few lines from a poem she has written called ‘that beast called age’. she happily remembers a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years ago, who said he didn’t believe she was more than 78: “i said, ‘thank you, doctor. you can go now.’”she also has a practical idea for people who are overweight: “i just think people shouldn’t eat too much. when i hear someone say, ‘oh, i can’t lose weight’, i say: ‘sellotape.’” she mimes taping her mouth shut. “i said this the other day to a big fat man. everything in moderation is my motto.”earlier in 2013, allen was watching the news and saw a woman get the british empire medal. “the woman said: ‘i’m 80 and i’m the oldest fitness instructor in the country!’ i thought: ‘no, you’re not.’” but allen won’t write to the queen to complain.nannan
elementary	when pope benedict xvi was elected in 2005, he said he was “a simple, humble worker in god’s vineyard”. and on a grey, cold, windy monday in february, he resigned in the same way: like an old workman with pains in his back and no more strength in his arms. the first german pope in modern times gave an exact departure time. “from 28 february 2013, at 20.00 hours”, he told a gathering of cardinals in the vatican, “the see of rome, the see of saint peter, will be vacant and there will be an election for a new pope.”one of the cardinals at the gathering was a mexican cardinal, monsignor oscar sanchéz barba, from guadalajara. he was in rome for an official meeting. “we were all in the apostolic palace,” he said. “the pope took a sheet of paper and read from it.“we were all …” – sanchéz barba couldn’t find the word. the cardinals had just heard the man they believe is god’s representative on earth resign. “the cardinals were just looking at one another,” sanchéz barba said.angelo sodano, the dean of the college of cardinals, who probably already knew about the pope’s decision, gave a short speech. he told the pope that the cardinals would be loyal to him and added that he and the others present had listened to the pope’s words with a feeling of confusion. at the end of his speech, the pope blessed the cardinals and left. “it was so simple; the simplest thing you can imagine,” said sanchéz barba. “then we all left in silence. there was absolute silence … and sadness.”john thavis spent 30 years reporting on the vatican and has a book, the vatican diaries, that will be published soon. he said he had a feeling before that the pope was going to resign. thavis said that in the long interview benedict gave to a german journalist in 2010, he had said he would resign if he felt he could no longer do the job. “i asked myself: if i were pope and wanted to resign, when would i choose? he has completed his series of books and most of his projects. also, there were no dates in his calendar of events he had to attend. i thought the most likely date was 22 february but i got it wrong.”soon after the announcement, the vatican was saying that the pope’s decision was brave. thavis agreed: “what i find particularly courageous is that he is going now, when he is not sick; and that he’s leaving because he’s tired and not because he’s ill.” but is that the whole story? does the pope know more about his state of health than the vatican has so far made public?benedict said that he is resigning not just for physical reasons but also for psychological reasons. he said that the position of pope needed both strength of mind and strength of body, and in the last few months he felt that he was slowly losing that strength. there will no doubt be other theories in future days and weeks, just as there were following the death of pope john paul i in 1978, 33 days after his election. already people are saying that there was a secret in benedict’s past and that somebody was going to tell everyone. the vatican will no doubt say those stories are nonsense. but we can understand why some people think there might be a secret, because benedict’s decision is so historic.at st peter’s basilica, julia rochester, from london, still didn’t know what the pope’s resignation meant. “if you’re god’s chosen person, how do you choose not be chosen?” she asked. it is a question many catholics will be asking their priests in future weeks.
advanced	we may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm back to the future ii, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched. experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally altering the transportation landscape. òitõs a very dynamic time,ó said robert puentes, of the brookings institutionõs metropolitan policy program think- tank. òthereõs a focus on a tighter connection between the role of transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people.óas the average us commute lengthens and the countryõs infrastructure ages badly, cities across the us are being forced to rede ne what transportation is. increasingly, urban planners, transportation experts and scientists are realizing that old auto-centric models focused on easing traf c congestion arenõt enough to tackle issues like population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now, more than ever, an integral component of a cityõs larger sustainability efforts.big us cities like los angeles, seattle and chicago are working to make better use of their streets by adding more bus lanes, augmenting pedestrian walkways and expanding their rail options, while at the same time working with the private sector on advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment, essentially making transportation intelligent. òthe most sustainable places to live are those places that have multi-modal transport systems,ó puentes said. òyou canõt be a global competitive city if you donõt have a robust transportation network.óhere are three of the key trends that experts predict will shape the transportation industry over the coming years. connectivity the rise of ride-sharing services like uber and lyft ð essentially taxis booked at the click of a smartphone button ð and apps like waze, which uses real-time traf c data to  nd the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people get around and affecting the very way in which traf c moves through a city. communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era, according to allan clelland, an expert on transportation technology.according to a recent study from the uclaõs institute of transportation studies, vehicle travel has declined among millennials ð individuals born roughly between the early 1980s and early 2000s ð compared to previous generations. according to the study, those born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives.meanwhile, those still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to waze. experts say the traf c app has eased congestion on motorways and reduced travel times for drivers but also led to a problematic rise in cars moving through residential neighbourhoods. this has angered residents, who claim the increased traf c on their quiet roads reduces their quality of life.this trend could continue as vehicle-to-vehicle data communication, as well as communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure, grows. currently, a traf c light can detect when a car is approaching but thatõs about it. companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.automation driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. however, the partial automation of cars is already underway. alexandre bayen of the university of california expects automation will progress in stages:  rst, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: essentially, vehicles that are connected electronically and travel in single  le.the idea of a fully automated transportation system is intriguing because it has the potential to improve safety by removing human error and increase the ef ciency of car owners, who can get on with other tasks during a long commute. it can also help reduce carbon emissions and traf c congestion and allow more people access to cars. but, even if driverless technology were ready to hit the roads now, it would take a long time to get fully automated given the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.to see what driverless cars might look like in action, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.environmental concern as the world races to avoid catastrophic climate change, and countries, states and cities work to meet ambitious emissions goals, these policies could also have a big impact on the future of transportation, spurring everything from zero- and low-emission vehicles to apps that encourage more walking, biking and carpooling.sharon feigon, executive director of the shared use mobility center, envisages a future where a person can use a transit pass that gives them access to numerous modes of transport in a given day. if their train is delayed, for instance, they can access a city bike, take a shuttle or rent a vehicle through a car share programme using the same pass. òweõre going to see these systems packaged together and make it as easy as possible to connect them up with each other so people can transfer seamlessly between them,ó she said.when considering the future of transportation, itõs also important to keep in mind why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. technologies and trends that reduce the need for those trips ð say, virtual meetings or telecommuting ð could also have a big impact on transportation.there was a time when the idea of a  ying car represented the height of innovation but the technologies being imagined and developed now could be seen as even more sophisticated ð and more useful in tackling the social and environmental threats that we face over the coming decades.ó
advanced	the mass collection of telephone records by government surveillance programmes poses a clear threat to the personal privacy of ordinary citizens, according to us researchers who used basic phone logs to identify people and uncover confidential information about their lives.armed with anonymous “metadata” on people’s calls and texts, but not the content of the communications, two scientists at stanford university worked out individuals’ names, where they lived and the names of their partners. but that was not all.the same data led them to uncover potentially sensitive information about some individuals. one man was found to own a rifle, while another had recently been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. other data pointed to a new pregnancy and a person with multiple sclerosis.the results highlight the extraordinary power of telephone metadata – the number called, when and for how long – particularly when it is paired with public information available from services such as google, yelp and facebook. the value of the data, which is not subject to the same legal protections as the content of people’s communications, has long been recognized by the security services. as stewart baker, the former general counsel at the us national security agency (nsa), put it in the aftermath of edward snowden’s revelations: “metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody’s life.”patrick mutchler, a computer security researcher at stanford, said that while the power of metadata was understood by those gathering the information, the public was largely in the dark because so few published studies have revealed how rich the data is. “that makes it difficult for people with strong opinions about these programmes to fight them. now, we have hard evidence we can point to that didn’t exist in the past,” he said.for the study, the researchers signed up 823 people who agreed to have metadata collected from their phones through an android app. the app also received information from their facebook accounts, which the scientists used to check the accuracy of their results. in all, the researchers gathered metadata on more than 250,000 calls and over 1.2m texts.analysts who logged into the nsa’s metadata-gathering system were initially allowed to examine data up to three hops away from an individual. a call from the target individual’s phone to another number was one hop. from that phone to another was two hops. and so on. the records available to analysts stretched back for five years. the collection window has now been restricted to two hops and 18 months at most.writing in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences, mutchler describes how, on a shoestring budget, he and fellow graduate student, jonathan mayer, uncovered a wealth of personal information, some of it sensitive, about people who took part in the study. through automatic and manual searches, they identified 82% of people’s names. the same technique gave them the names of businesses the people had called. when these were plotted on a map, they revealed clusters of local businesses, which the scientists speculated surrounded the person’s home address. in this way, they named the city people lived in 57% of the time, and were nearly 90% accurate in placing people within 50 miles of their home. mutchler believes some of the misses came from people not updating their facebook page when they moved out of their parents’ home, for example, to go to college.the scientists next delved into more personal territory. using a simple computer program to analyse people’s call patterns, they inferred who among the study volunteers was in a relationship. once they knew the owner of a particular number had a partner, identifying the significant other was easy, they report.for the final part of the study, the researchers delved even deeper, to see what sensitive information they could glean from telephone metadata. they gathered details on calls made to and from a list of organizations, including hospitals, pharmacies, religious groups, legal services, firearms retailers and repair firms. from these, they pieced together some extraordinary vignettes from people’s lives.the metadata from one person in the study showed they had a long call from a cardiology centre, spoke briefly with a medical laboratory, answered a number of short calls from a local pharmacy and then made calls to a hotline for abnormal heart-rate monitoring devices. another participant made frequent calls to a local gun supplier that specialized in semiautomatic rifles and later placed a number of long calls to the customer support hotline run by a major gun manufacturer that produced the rifles. the metadata from two others suggested one had multiple sclerosis and the other had just become pregnant.“all of this should be taken as an indication of what is possible with two graduate students and limited resources,” said mutchler, who argues that the findings should make policymakers think twice before authorizing mass surveillance programmes. “large-scale metadata surveillance programmes, like the nsa’s, will necessarily expose highly confidential information about ordinary citizens,” the scientists write, adding: “to strike an appropriate balance between national security and civil liberties, future policymaking must be informed by input from relevant sciences.”ross anderson, professor of security engineering at cambridge university, said the study provided numbers that discussions can now be based on. “with the right analytics running over nationscale communications data, you can infer huge amounts of sensitive information on everyone. we always suspected that, of course, but here’s the data.”
advanced	europe is to become the first place in the world to force ‘real-world’ emissions tests on car makers, opening up a new front in the fight to tackle air pollution. new regulations will introduce the tests to reveal what cars’ emissions are like when driving on roads and in traffic rather than in ideal, laboratory-like conditions, as is currently the case.green lit by european commission vice president, frans timmermans, the tests are designed to enforce a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre, a level met by only one car out of 16, according to researchers. other countries, such as china and korea, which are also considering real-world emissions tests, will be watching what happens next closely.pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and particulates are thought to be responsible for at least one quarter of the 29,000 annual pollution-related deaths in the uk alone. that figure is likely to rise, when the committee on the medical effects of air pollutants publishes what it calls “strengthening evidence” of damage to public health from nitrogen oxide emissions later in 2015.but the current ‘new european drive cycle’ laboratory test for measuring these emissions is a quarter of a century old and has been outpaced by technological developments in the car industry. studies have shown that the results of lab techniques to measure car emissions can easily be fixed by using techniques such as taping up doors and windows to minimize air resistance, driving on unrealistically smooth roads and testing at improbably high temperatures. campaigners say that car makers also use tricks such as programming vehicles to go into a low emissions mode when their front wheels are spinning and their back wheels are stationary, as happens in such lab experiments.“the commission is finalizing a proposal to introduce a new emissions testing procedure that will allow proper assessment of the vehicles in real driving,” said lucia caudet, a commission spokesperson. the proposal still needs approval from other commissioners and a technical committee but “we don’t expect any major internal hurdles,” a european union (eu) source added.“one key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 citizens annually is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars, causing many times more pollution on the road,” said greg archer, the clean vehicles manager for transport and environment. “the development of a new, real-world driving emission test is an important step forward in tackling urban air pollution. eu states should now support the commission’s proposals and ignore the whingeing from car makers that the rules are too tough.”according to research by the international council on clean transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg/km standard, with some models running at 22 times above the recommended limit. only one car out of 16 met the 80g target. around one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport – mostly diesel – and, in urban areas, concentrations can rise as high as 64%, european environment agency figures indicate.campaigners say that the car industry has tried to delay reforms to car test cycles but industry groups deny this, arguing that a five-year lead-time is necessary for technical and economic reasons. “real driving emissions (rde) is a totally new regulation that will force significant emission control hardware changes that may be demanded in the middle of a vehicle’s production lifetime,” said cara mclaughlin, a spokesperson for the european automobile manufacturers association (acea). “however, acea fully accepts that rde will apply to new types of cars from september 2017.”in an unusual move, the car association sent timmermans a draft regulation of their own for him to consider, after eu representatives finally agreed a regulation to implement the nitrogen oxide limits with beefed-up road trials and strict monitoring of exhaust fumes. acea’s draft regulation would have covered fewer pollutants and further delayed the regulation’s phased introduction until 2020. test distances would have been shortened from 1,300m to below 700m, minimum temperatures would have been raised from -7c to -3c and more rural roads would have been used. “the lobbyists were all over this,” archer said. “this was a real attempt at subversion of the legislative process.”after timmerman’s apparent rejection of the acea proposal, the regulation will now pass to commissioners for a rubber stamp, and member states for final amendments, before an expected introduction in september. by 2017, the first real-world car emissions tests are expected to begin in earnest. with a similar battle already looming over the testing of co2 emissions for cars at the end of 2015 – and with comparable debates in other countries – the introduction of the eu’s new emissions tests will be watched closely.
advanced	they are the darkness seekers – and they are growing in number. on black fell, looking down on northumberland’s beautiful kielder water reservoir, a group of people wait in a car park next to a strange wooden building with a minimalist design beamed down from the future. this is kielder observatory, the centre of britain’s nascent astrotourism industry. and those waiting outside were the lucky ones. many more had applied for a night of stargazing at the observatory but numbers are strictly limited.inside, next to a woodburner and under dimmed lights, the observatory’s founder and lead astronomer, gary fildes, a former bricklayer with tarzan hair, delivers a pep talk to his colleagues and volunteers. the team discusses the prospect of seeing the northern lights but fildes is doubtful. instead, they decide to train their powerful telescopes on jupiter and venus and later to pick out stars such as capella and betelgeuse. an additional attraction is the appearance of the international space station.“remember,” fildes tells his team, “it’s about interaction, it’s about entertainment, it’s about inspiring people.” he puts on some music. pink floyd, the jam, the pogues. “by 9.30, the sky is going to be sexy,” fildes says. “it’s going to be epic.”fildes, 49, is at the forefront of the uk’s burgeoning astrotourism industry. the pivotal moment for northumberland came in 2013 when the entire national park housing hadrian’s wall, along with kielder water and forest park, some 1,500 sq km, was awarded dark sky park status, the only one in england. dark sky parks are rare. the 2013 star count revealed that only 5% of the uk population can see more than 31 stars on a good night.the tucson, arizona-based international dark-sky association (ida) confers the status only on places that take major steps to avoid light pollution. recipients must also prove their night skies are sufficiently dark. in northumberland dark sky park, as the area was rebadged, it is so dark that venus casts a shadow on the earth.duncan wise, visitor development officer for the northumberland national park authority, helped to spearhead the campaign for dark-sky status after the council for the protection of rural england found it was one of britain’s most tranquil places. “we tend to look at landscape as everything up to the horizon,” wise said. “but what about what’s above it?” wise and others spent years drawing up their submission to the ida, collecting reams of light readings and forming an alliance of local councils, parks’ bodies and community groups to produce an exterior lighting master plan that influences the construction of new developments in the area.their efforts have been vindicated. many of the 1.5 million who visit northumberland each year are now aware of its dark sky status. “we get a lot of people coming here to see the sky now,” says the man at the car-hire firm in newcastle. “they come in autumn and winter, when it’s darkest. good for the b&bs as they get business all year round now.” local hoteliers now issue guests with night-vision torches and put out deckchairs at night. those who have acquired some knowledge of astronomy can receive a badge confirming that their hotels are “dark sky friendly”.wise acknowledges that northumberland needs to do more to capitalize on its scarce resource and believes the region needs a couple more observatories to ensure that visitors will see what they came for. a £14m national landscape discovery centre, which he describes as the north’s answer to the eden project, will have an observatory when it is completed in a couple of years.fildes has grand designs. he is planning britain’s first “astrovillage”, one that would house the largest public observatory in the world and boast a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, a one-metre aperture telescope, and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes. the multimillion-pound project would feature a hotel and draw in 100,000 people a year, four times the number currently able to use the observatory. fildes is cryptic about his backers but believes the astrovillage will be a reality by 2018.however, northumberland faces competition. galloway forest park in scotland also has dark sky park status. since exmoor was designated europe’s first international dark sky reserve – one notch below dark sky park – in 2011, a range of local businesses offering stargazing breaks and safaris has sprung up. the uk will have to go some way to eclipse northern chile, which boasts more than a dozen tourist observatories and has some of the clearest skies in the world. the teide national park in tenerife is also becoming a major astrotourism destination.so, what is driving the desire to look upwards? the media have helped. tv presenters like brian cox have attracted a new generation of stargazers. “brian cox has made astronomy accessible,” says wise. “it’s no longer seen as the province of professors in studies with brass telescopes.” technology has also played a part. apps such as stellarium now turn smartphones into pocket-size planetariums. ultimately, though, fildes believes people are starting to appreciate what lies above. “if you had to build a visitor attraction from scratch, what could be better than the universe?”
advanced	he is not the first person to express scepticism about mars one, a vastly ambitious private mission aiming to settle humans on mars from 2025. but joseph roche is different from most critics: he’s on the shortlist of astronauts.roche, an astrophysicist at trinity college dublin who was announced in february as among the 100 people in line for the mission, has written for the guardian expressing his grave doubts about the viability of mars one.the selection process, roche writes, “was not rigorous enough to reach the requisite standard of more traditional astronaut selection programmes”. he also says the dutch mars one team have displayed “a certain naivety” in believing they can succeed alone in the supposed $6bn mission and should now accept it is very unlikely to happen.he writes: “more openness and transparency would benefit mars one greatly but i think that the shortcomings of the selection process, coupled with their unwillingness to engage and collaborate with the scientific community mean that the time might have come for mars one to acknowledge the implausibility of this particular venture and turn their efforts towards supporting other exciting and more viable upcoming space missions.”roche also expressed worries about the way the mission organizers publicized a so-called top-ten candidates. the ranking, he said, didn’t mean these were the most likely potential astronauts but was, instead, based on how many “supporter points” each had earned through acts such as buying official merchandise.he writes: “these points are mars one’s supporter points which ‘represent the degree of your support to mars one’s mission’.” these points play no role in the selection process and serve only to show how much each supporter has donated to mars one.”the official timeline for the mission says the group plans to dispatch a stationary lander and satellite to mars in 2018, followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022. humans would start arriving in 2025 and crews of four would be sent every two years to add to the settlement. they would not return to earth.in february, a prominent supporter of the project, gerard ’t hooft, a dutch nobel laureate in physics, said he did not believe this timetable was realistic. he said: “it will take quite a bit longer and be quite a bit more expensive. when they first asked me to be involved, i told them: ‘you have to put a zero after everything’.”roche also spoke to medium, a us blogging platform that has previously expressed grave sceptism about mars one, reporting among other things that the supposed 200,000 applications to be astronauts in fact totalled 2,761.he told medium about the selection process in more detail: “i have not met anyone from mars one in person. initially, they’d said there were going to be regional interviews; we would travel there, we’d be interviewed, we’d be tested over several days and, in my mind, that sounded at least like something that approached a legitimate astronaut selection process.“but then they made us sign a non-disclosure agreement if we wanted to be interviewed and then, all of a sudden, it changed from being a proper regional interview over several days to being a ten-minute skype call.”roche told the guardian he did not want to give more interviews as he was wary about being negative about the idea of space travel.in his comment piece he writes: “i am passionate about pushing the boundaries of scientific endeavour and that is why the ambitiousness of the mars one plan appealed to me. although mars one were never likely to overcome the financial and technical barriers during their proposed timeline, it was refreshing to hear a new idea that challenges us to think about our own role in the future of space exploration.“being part of the subsequent public debate over the ethics and morality of future missions has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable aspects of my candidacy with mars one. if a one-way mission to mars ever became possible, then i would always volunteer. for an astrophysicist, that is not a difficult decision to make but it is also a moot point because i do not think we will see a one-way mission in my lifetime.”
advanced	tigers are more numerous in nepal than at any time since the 1970s, a new census has revealed, giving conservationists hope that the big cats, whose numbers have been dropping across south asia for 100 years, can be saved.the number of wild royal bengal tigers in nepal has increased to 198 – a 63.6% rise in five years – the government survey showed. “this is very encouraging,” said maheshwar dhakal, an ecologist with nepal’s department of national parks and wildlife conservation.the census is based on the examination of pictures from more than 500 cameras placed in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors. more than 250 conservationists and wildlife experts worked on the survey, which cost about £250,000. dhakal said that a parallel survey was conducted in india and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013. “it will take a few more months for india, which now has 1,300 big cats in several huge protected areas, to finalize the data,” he added. nepal has pledged to double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 when the last systematic tiger count took place.increasing prosperity in asia has pushed up prices for tiger skins and the body parts used in traditional chinese medicines. international gangs pay poor local nepali significant sums to kill the cats. the skin and bones are handed to middlemen, who pass easily through the porous border to india, where the major dealers are based.one major problem is complicity between senior officials and mafia networks involved in the trade. conservation experts credit the increase in numbers to the effective policing of national parks, stronger anti-poaching drives and better management of tiger habitats in nepal, where forests cover 29% of the land. but they say nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers prey so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat.as the number of tigers has increased over the years, so have incidents of conflict with villagers. seven people were killed in attacks by tigers around national parks in 2012 compared to four in 2011, park officials said. villagers are also seeking better protection. “the government is making conservation plans for tigers. but it should also come up with plans to protect people from tigers,” krishna bhurtel, a local village headman in chitwan, told nepali newspaper nagarik. wildlife authorities captured a tiger in chitwan after it killed two people, including a villager who was pulled from his bed in may.thousands of tigers once roamed the forests in bangladesh, india and nepal. but their numbers have dropped to about 3,000, a 95% drop over a century. chitwan national park in central nepal has the highest number of adult tigers, with 120, followed by bardiya national park (50) and shukla phanta wildlife reserve (17).diwakar chapagain, who heads a world wildlife fund nepal unit that monitors wildlife trade, said tiger skins were in demand in tibet, where well-heeled people use them as festival costumes.in nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins in front of stuffed tigers for special occasions. some affluent nepali have mounted tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms. tiger bones are in high demand for use in traditional chinese medicines. “the trade in tiger parts is lucrative and fetches thousands of dollars in illegal markets,” chapagain said, highlighting the threat tigers face.
advanced	margaret thatcher, the most dominant british prime minister since winston churchill in 1940 and a global champion of the late 20th-century free market economic revival, has died. the british government announced that she would receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours at st paul’s cathedral.the british prime minister, david cameron, who is cutting short his trip to europe to return to london following the news, said: “it was with great sadness that l learned of lady thatcher’s death. we’ve lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great briton.” he added: “as our first woman prime minister, margaret thatcher succeeded against all the odds, and the real thing about margaret thatcher is that she didn’t just lead our country, she saved our country, and i believe she will go down as the greatest british peacetime prime minister.”in a statement, president barack obama said, “here in america, many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with president reagan, reminding the world that we are not simply carried along by the currents of history – we can shape them with moral conviction, unyielding courage and iron will.”the first woman elected to lead a major western state, lady thatcher, as she became after the longest premiership since 1827, served 11 unbroken years at no 10 downing street.thatcher, who was 87, had been in declining health for some years, suffering from dementia. after a series of mini-strokes in 2002, thatcher withdrew from public life, no longer able to make the kind of waspish pronouncements that had been her forte in office – and beyond.her death was greeted with tributes from across the political spectrum.as labour sources announced the party would suspend campaigning in local elections as a mark of respect, its leader, ed miliband, said: “she will be remembered as a unique figure. she reshaped the politics of a whole generation. she was britain’s first woman prime minister. she moved the centre ground of british politics and was a huge figure on the world stage. the labour party disagreed with much of what she did and she will always remain a controversial figure. but we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength.”the deputy prime minister, nick clegg, said: “margaret thatcher was one of the defining figures in modern british politics. whatever side of the political debate you stand on, no one can deny that as prime minister she left a unique and lasting imprint on the country she served.”describing her as a political phenomenon, the former tory prime minister sir john major said: “her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.”the “iron lady” proved a significant cold war ally of the us president ronald reagan in the final showdown with the soviet union, which broke up under reformist pressures led by mikhail gorbachev, a kremlin leader with whom thatcher famously declared she could “do business”. as a result, many ordinary voters in ex-soviet bloc states saw her as a bold champion of their liberty, a view widely shared across the spectrum of mainstream us opinion – though not at home or among key eu partners.thatcher was an unremarkable mid-ranking conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975. within a decade, she had become known around the world – both admired and detested – for her pro-market domestic reforms and her implacable attitudes in foreign policy, including her long-running battle with the ira, which almost managed to murder her when it placed a bomb in the grand hotel, brighton, in 1984.at home, the emerging doctrine of thatcherism meant denationalization of state-owned industry – the new word “privatization” came into widespread use in many countries – and defeat of militant trade unionists, notably the national union of miners, whose year-long strike (1984– 85) was bitter and traumatic.boosted by the newly arrived revenues from britain’s north sea oil fields, thatcher had room to manoeuvre and change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies – including moderate members of her own party.but she also deployed her notorious “handbaggings”, or verbal attacks, in the european union to obtain a british rebate – “my money” as she called it. she was less successful in fending off the centralizing ambitions of the “belgian empire”, her description of the european commission, especially in the years when it was headed by the french socialist jacques delors.her allies in the tabloid press egged her on. and, as the british economy recovered from the severe recession that her monetarist medicine had inflicted on it – to tame the unions and cure inflation – she briefly seemed invincible.but untrammelled power, with the defeat or retirement of allies who had kept her in check, led to mistakes and growing unpopularity. when sir geoffrey howe, nominally her deputy, finally fell out with thatcher – chiefly over europe – his devastating resignation speech triggered a leadership challenge. thatcher made way for john major rather than risk losing to him in a ballot.in retirement, she wrote highly successful memoirs in two volumes and campaigned energetically on behalf of the thatcher foundation, which sought to promote her values around the world.
advanced	our new international survey across 33 countries shows just how wrong the world is about a range of key social realities.british people think the top 1% wealthiest households own 59% of their countryõs wealth, when they actually òonlyó own 23%. americans think that 33% of their population are immigrants, when in fact it is only 14%.brazilians think the average age in their country is 56, when it is only 31. russians think that 31% of their politicians are women, when it is only 14%.in britain, people think that an extraordinary 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%. in india, the online population think 60% of the whole country also has internet access, when in fact only 19% do.why are people across the world so often so clueless about these realities?it is partly that we just struggle with basic maths and some of us clearly misunderstand the questions or interpret them differently. for example, most countries hugely overestimate how many people do not af liate themselves with a religion: across the 33 countries, 37% do not, according to respondents, but the average is actually just 18%. this will be partly because we will be thinking of how many people practise their religion, rather than what they put on census forms. people also take mental shortcuts, where they grab for easily available information even if it doesnõt quite  t the question. our huge overestimates of the rural populations in most countries will be affected by how much of the physical landmass rural areas make up, rather than a careful calculation of how unoccupied it generally is. in daniel kahnemanõs terms, answers to these sorts of questions are classic examples of òfastó thinking, rather than òslowó.we are tied to our own perspective and struggle to imagine the variety in our countries, as highlighted by our indian sampleõs massively overestimating their populationõs access to the internet. our study was mostly carried out through an online survey ð and, in developing countries, this will be representative of a more af uent, connected group rather than the population as a whole. in some ways, we may have expected this more educated sample to get closer to reality ð those with higher education levels tend to be more accurate on these types of questions. but what we  nd, throughout the study, is that people grossly generalize from their own situations, forgetting how unrepresentative they are.we suffer from what social psychologists call òemotional innumeracyó when estimating realities: this means we are sending a message about what is worrying us as much as trying to get the right answers. cause and effect run both ways, with our concern leading to our misperceptions as much as our misperceptions creating our concern.for britain, this is likely to be part of the explanation for peopleõs huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own, how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when it is really only 13%, according to of cial estimates). people are worried about the concentration of wealth, the housing pressures facing young people and immigration levels, and this is re ected in them overstating the scale of the issues. but, the survey suggests there are also some issues where people are not as worried as they should be. for example, most countries hugely underestimate how much of their population is overweight or obese. the worst case is saudi arabia, where people think only 28% are, when 71% are. britons think it is 44%, when it is actually nearly half as much again ð 62% are either overweight or obese.and, in many ways, it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study. the top 1% in russia own 70% of the nationõs wealth, while the top 1% in new zealand only own 18%. half of italians aged 25-34 still live with their parents, when it is only 4% in norway. the average age in india is 27; it is 47 in japan. only 10% of politicians are women in brazil, hungary and japan, when 44% are in sweden. when the reality is so strange and varied, it is no wonder weõre so wrong.
advanced	from all across rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring burundi, people  ock to the southern town of butare to a little shop called inzozi nziza (sweet dreams). they come for a taste of the unknown, something most have never tasted ð the sweet, cold, velvety embrace of ice cream.here, at the central african countryõs  rst ice- cream parlour, customers can buy scoops in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple  avours. toppings include fresh fruit, honey, chocolate chips and granola. black tea and coffee are also on sale.the shop, which has òice cream, coffee, dreamsó across its signage, is milking local curiosity about the dessert ð and òchanging livesó in the process, says inzozi nzizaõs manager, louise ingabire.òice cream is important,ó she says between mouthfuls of a honey- avoured offering. òsome rwandans like ice cream, but itõs a new thing. we still have some work to do, to tell others that theyõll enjoy it.ótrue to inzozi nzizaõs motto, the shop can certainly make dreams come true. òi didnõt have a job before: i just stayed at home. now, i have a vision for the future. i am making money and i can give some of it to my family,ó says the 27-year-old.butare, which has 89,600 residents and is located 135km south of the capital, kigali, is the home of the national university of rwanda. inzozi nziza has become a hub for tired students looking to treat themselves to something cool and different.òitõs something uniting people here,ó kalisa migendo, a 24-year-old agriculture student, says. òif you need to go out and talk to a friend, a girl or a boy, you come to inzozi nziza for an ice cream.ómost of the ingredients are sourced locally and the milk comes from a depot in nearby nyanza. the vanilla beans and cocoa are imported.inzozi nziza was opened by the theatre director odile gakire katese. she met alexis miesen and jennie dundas, co-founders of blue marble ice cream in brooklyn, new york, and formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010.òan ice-cream shop, katese proposed, might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits, hopes and family traditions,ó miesen says.at the start, miesen and dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative and non-pro t. they did not set  nancial targets, but waited for 18 months before they transferred their shares to the women, who had by then proved their business credentials.the shopõs success is no exception, says fatuma ndangiza, deputy chief executive of the rwanda governance board. òsmall businesses are mostly managed by women but when it comes to big business where you have to compete for big tenders, very few women are there. women are newcomers to big business,ó she points out. òwe have more women entrepreneurs. itõs an area where women are taking an interest, both in and outside kigali.óthough ice cream is somewhat new to rwanda, ndangiza is enthused by the idea of the shop. òi think itõs great. it requires a lot of skills and changing peopleõs mindsets because selling and eating ice cream is not part of our culture. i think being able to innovate and introduce this on the market, and the process of making it, is quite interesting.óthe butare shop employs nine women, who spend their spare time practising with ingoma nshya, rwandaõs  rst and only female drumming troupe, which was established by katese ten years ago.the musicians are hutu and tutsi women, some survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million tutsis and moderate hutus were killed.some members of ingoma nshya are widows, some orphans. others have been affected by the massacre in different ways.historically, says ingabire, rwandan women were forbidden to drum and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry. òbut itõs something which brings unity.óingabireõs father, two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide. òsome of us are survivors; some know someone who was killed,ó she says. òwhen iõm drumming with them, it gives me power because weõre still alive and survivors.óthe popular eatery features in a documentary by rob and lisa fruchtman, sibling  lm-makers. sweet dreams, which tells the story of how the women have forged a promising post-genocide future, also includes the female drummers.the  lm, which has been screened in more than a dozen countries, including the us, uk and several african states, premieres in rwanda in 2014. òwe feel the  lm is about resilience, hope, bravery, resourcefulness and the ability to change the course of your own life,ó says lisa fruchtman, who won an academy award for  lm- editing in 1984.
advanced	seaworld has suffered an 84% collapse in pro ts as customers have deserted the controversial aquatic theme park company following claims it mistreated orca whales.the company, which trains dolphins and killer whales to perform tricks in front of stadiums full of spectators, has reported declines in attendance, sales and pro ts because of òcontinued brand challengesó.seaworld has been in the headlines since the 2013 documentary black sh detailed claims that its treatment of orca whales provoked violent behaviour, contributing to the deaths of three people. following the release of the documentary, attendance collapsed, the company lost more than half of its market value on wall street and its former ceo was forced out.the company has since launched a nationwide marketing campaign to combat animal rights activists claims that, among other things, captive orcas die at a younger age than their wild counterparts.despite cutting ticket prices and spending $10m on the marketing blitz, which features its veterinarians caring for whales, seaworld ceo joel manby was forced to admit that the company is still struggling to convince the public that it treats its whales well.òwe realize we have much work ahead of us to recover more of our attendance base, increase revenue and improve our performance, as returning to historical performance levels will take time and investment,ó manby said. òon the reputation side, early feedback on our campaign has been positive. however, we recognize that fully resolving our brand challenges in california will require sustained focus and commitment to correct misinformation.óòwe will continue to  ght with the facts because the facts are on our side,ó he said recently on a conference call with journalists and analysts. manby, who joined the company as ceo in 2015 to help the company rehabilitate itself, said he would set out his vision for the future of the company at a special event on 6 november.already in the pipeline are plans for a new shark exhibition in orlando and an attraction in san antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a ònaturalisticó setting.the companyõs  nancial report, released on 6 august, showed net income in the second quarter dropped from $37.4m in 2014 to $5.8m in 2015, an 84% decrease. revenue fell from $405m to $392m. attendance dropped by more than 100,000 from 6.58 million to 6.48 million.analysts will now be closely watching seaworldõs sales and attendance numbers in the third quarter, which is traditionally the companyõs most pro table and covers the summer holiday season. attendance may suffer from a fresh scandal in july 2015, in which a seaworld employee was alleged to have in ltrated animal rights protest groups against the company.jared goodman, director of animal law for people for the ethical treatment of animals (peta), which has been leading campaigns against seaworld, said: òseaworld is in the midst of a spying scandal, animals are dying in its tanks and tens of thousands of people have opposed its bid to build a new orca prison so it should come as no surprise that seaworldõs quarterly earnings have plummeted yet again in the second quarter. families just donõt want to buy tickets to see orcas going insane inside tiny tanks and seaworldõs pro ts, like the orcas, wonõt recover until the abusement park empties its tanks and builds coastal sanctuaries.óseaworldõs shares, which were worth $39 in 2013, were changing hands for just under $18 in august 2015.
