intermediate	a long time ago, cinema audiences were transported to a galaxy far, far away.that was 1977 but, in 2015, as the franchise plans to release its seventh  lm, interest in star wars shows no sign of slowing down. now, there is news of a new  lm about han solo and of a reappearance for darth vader.òmany fans around the world are constantly waiting for the release of new poster art, new trailers and other information,ó said paul dergarabedian, a senior media analyst. òitõs hard to imagine any other movie franchise that could cause this much enthusiasm and excitement.óthe latest star wars mania started after disneyõs purchase of lucas lm from the  lmõs creator, george lucas, in 2012. disney paid $4bn for lucas lm and very soon announced that there would be three more star wars òepisodesó ð vii, viii and ix ð plus plans for spin-off movies and òstandalonesó.details of the second spin-off have now been made public. it is a story about han solo, the intergalactic smuggler played by harrison ford in the  rst three  lms. this second new  lm will be released in may 2018.it will follow the release in december 2015 of episode vii, directed by jj abrams and titled star wars: the force awakens. the unnamed episode viii is due out in 2017 and a spin-off, rogue one, will arrive in cinemas in 2016.that movie will outline a rebel mission to steal the plans of the death star, a key part of the story in the  rst  lm in 1977. there was lots of interest in the rumour that darth vader, the black-clad villain of the original series, will reappear in rogue one. the interest con rms the power of star wars nostalgia.in creating a multi-storyline, multi-character cinema òuniverseó around star wars, lucas lm-disney are copying the phenomenally successful series of  lms produced by marvel studios, which disney also bought, in 2009.disney has increased the level of marketing savvy to a product that was already popular: dergarabedian says the decision to make all six existing star wars  lms available on streaming services is òa brilliant way to build the excitement for the new  lm and reinvigorate the idea of star wars in the minds of the fansó.but, it is not certain that it needs reinvigorating. the level of enthusiasm that has surrounded star wars for at least the last twenty years is shown by the huge number of novels, comic books, video games and merchandising that lucas lm has created over the years.michael rosser, news editor for screen international, suggests that it is this òshared universeó of nostalgia that makes star wars the top  lm franchise. òthe great thing about the original  lms was that they created a huge universe of characters and possibility that sparked the imagination of viewers,ó he said.òfor years, people have been wondering how the different parts of the story  t together. this new  lm goes back to han solo and luke skywalker so we hope it will reconnect with the original star wars  lms. the prequels failed to do that.órosser is referring to the three  lms lucas directed between 1999 and 2005 ð the phantom menace, attack of the clones and revenge of the sith ð which were about the life of luke skywalkerõs father, anakin, who becomes darth vader. despite quite bad reviews, the prequels took $2.5bn at the worldwide box of ce.òit shows the power of star wars that, although they were disappointing, the prequels still made a lot of money,ó said rosser.in the world of  lm, branding and a successful franchise are very important. is there a risk that movie studios will simply become branding machines and lose their interest in cinema?rosser thinks not. òthey are desperate to keep the franchise going and make sure new  lms are of good quality. they also want people to go to the cinema at a time when lots are staying home for entertainment. but you donõt want to watch star wars on your iphone.ómeanwhile, dergarabedian expects massive business when the force awakens reaches cinemas in december 2015. òwe certainly expect a record opening for december and the  lm should make at least a billion dollars worldwide. truly, star wars is the ultimate movie brand.ónan
intermediate	an international agreement to improve safety in bangladesh’s clothing factories could face legal action because factory owners are demanding compensation for the cost of closures and repair work. some repair programmes are expected to take months and factory owners say they cannot pay staff while factories are closed, as well as paying for major works needed to ensure that buildings are safe. the building repairs are happening in the wake of the collapse of the rana plaza complex in the capital of bangladesh, dhaka, in 2013, in which 1,138 people were killed.the problems come as hundreds of bangladeshi clothing factories per month are inspected for firesafety and structural problems under the accord on fire and building safety in bangladesh, which is supported by over 170 international brands, including primark and marks & spencer, and international trade unions, including industriall.the owner of one dhaka-based factory, softex cotton, has said he will take legal action against the accord because his factory was closed down due to structural problems. he is demanding $100m in compensation.another factory owner said that, once a factory closed its doors, even for a few months, it would lose orders and close permanently: “there is no such thing as temporary closure,” he said. the factory owner said that the accord agreement had “pussyfooted” around the issue of who paid for factory closures because they just wanted to get as many brands as possible to sign up to a deal in the wake of the rana plaza disaster. he said there was no clear process in place to pay the costs involved.jenny holdcroft, policy director for industriall, which has been closely involved in the accord, said that the agreement ensured that factories would not lose orders during closure because brands had committed to maintain orders with suppliers for two years.twelve factories have been identified by the accord as needing significant work so far, but holdcroft said many of those only needed partial closure and production could continue on other floors. the accord also legally requires brands to ensure that workers are paid during factory closures. she said the detail on who would make payments had been left open in order to ensure that all those factory owners who could afford to pay for repairs and compensation for workers made the necessary payments.“this was always going to be a topic of negotiation. brands don’t want to commit to paying so that rich factory owners who have just pocketed the profits and not been spending on their factories for years continue to do so. there was obviously going to be disruption. if there was no disruption, there would be no change,” she said. a spokesman for the accord said negotiations over payments and even legal action would not hold up its work to improve safety in factories.however, pressure on the accord to contribute to the payment of displaced workers has increased after a rival factory-safety group, backed by us retailers including walmart and gap, the alliance for bangladesh worker safety, set aside $5m to help pay factory workers for up to two months while buildings are improved. it has, so far, identified five factories in four buildings where production needed to be suspended.“the alliance is sharing the workers’ salary along with entrepreneurs so now there is a big confusion. we had a big meeting with the accord to make them understand they have to come forward or how will we help our workers?” said shaidullah azim, a director of the bangladeshi garment manufacturers and exporters association.
intermediate	nelson mandela, the towering figure of africa’s struggle for freedom and a hero to millions around the world, has died at the age of 95.south africa’s first black president died with his family beside him at home in johannesburg after years of illness, which had caused him to stop taking part in public life.the news was announced to the country by the current president, jacob zuma. he said mandela had “departed” around 8.50pm local time and was at peace.“this is the moment of our deepest sorrow,” zuma said. “our nation has lost its greatest son. what made nelson mandela great was exactly what made him human. we saw in him what we look for in ourselves.“fellow south africans, nelson mandela brought us together and it is together that we will bid him farewell.”zuma announced that mandela would receive a state funeral and ordered that flags fly at half-mast.barack obama led tributes from world leaders, referring to mandela by his clan name – madiba. the us president said: “through his fierce dignity and strong will to sacrifice his own freedom for the freedom of others, madiba transformed south africa – and moved all of us.”uk prime minister david cameron said: “a great light has gone out in the world” and described mandela as “a hero of our time”.fw de klerk – the south african president who freed mandela and shared the nobel peace prize with him in 1993 – said the news was deeply sad for south africa and the world.“he lived reconciliation. he was a great unifier,” de klerk said.people gathered in the streets of south africa to celebrate mandela’s life.in soweto, people gathered to sing and dance near the house where he once lived. they sang songs from the anti-apartheid struggle. some people were wrapped in south african flags and the green, yellow and black colours of mandela’s party, the african national congress (anc)mandela’s death sends south africa deep into mourning and self-reflection, nearly 20 years after he led the country from racial apartheid to democracy for all.but his passing will also be felt by people around the world who considered mandela to be one of history’s last great statesmen, comparable with gandhi and martin luther king.it was his act of forgiveness, after spending 27 years in prison, 18 of them on robben island, that will assure his place in history. with south africa facing possible civil war, mandela chose reconciliation with the white minority to build a new democracy.he led the anc to victory in the country’s first multiracial election in 1994. he then voluntarily stepped down after one term.born rolihlahla dalibhunga in a small village in the eastern cape on 18 july, 1918, mandela was given his english name, nelson, by a teacher at his school.he joined the anc in 1943 and became a co-founder of its youth league. in 1952, he started south africa’s first black law firm with his partner, oliver tambo.mandela was a charming, charismatic figure with a passion for boxing and an eye for women. he once said: “i can’t help it if the ladies notice me. i am not going to protest.”when the anc was banned in 1960, mandela went underground. after the sharpeville massacre, in which 69 black protesters were shot dead by police, he took the difficult decision to begin an armed struggle. he was arrested and eventually charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government.conducting his own defence in the rivonia trial in 1964, he said: “i have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society, in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.“it is an ideal which i hope to live for and to achieve. but, if necessary, it is an ideal for which i am prepared to die.”he was not given the death penalty but was sentenced to life in prison.finally, in 1990, fw de klerk lifted the ban on the anc and mandela was released from prison, to scenes of great happiness that were seen around the world.archbishop desmond tutu, said: “ he restored others’ faith in africa and africans.”mandela’s 91st birthday was marked by the first annual “mandela day” in his honour. married three times, he had six children, 17 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.nannannannan
intermediate	the vice-president of google has warned that piles of digitized material – blogs, tweets, pictures, videos and official documents such as court rulings and emails – could be lost forever because the programs we need to view them will become defunct. our first steps into the digital world could be lost to future historians, vint cerf told the american association for the advancement of science’s annual meeting. he warned that we faced a “forgotten generation or even a forgotten century” because of what he called “bit rot”, where old computer files become useless junk.cerf says we need to develop digital methods to preserve old software and hardware so that out-of-date files can be recovered even if they are really old. “when you think about the quantity of documentation from our daily lives that is captured in digital form, like our interactions by email, people’s tweets and all of the world wide web, it’s clear that we could lose an awful lot of our history,” he said. “we don’t want our digital lives to fade away. if we want to preserve them, we need to make sure that the digital objects we create today can still be viewed far into the future,” he added.what is ‘bit rot’ and is vint cerf right to be worried? accessing digital content in the future could be less of a problem than cerf thinks. his warning highlights an irony at the heart of modern technology, where music, photos, letters and other documents are digitized in order to ensure their long-term survival. but, while researchers are making progress in storing digital files for centuries, the programs and hardware needed to read the files are continually falling out of use.“we are throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realizing it. we digitize things because we think we will preserve them. but what we don’t understand is that, unless we take other steps, those digital versions may not be any better, and may even be worse, than the artefacts that we digitized,” cerf says. “if there are photos you really care about, print them out.”ancient civilizations did not have these problems because histories written on clay tablets or sheets of papyrus needed only eyes to read them. to study today’s culture, future scholars would be faced with pdfs, word documents and hundreds of other file types that can only be interpreted with special software and sometimes hardware, too.the problem is already here. in the 1980s, it was routine to save documents on floppy disks and buy computer games on cassettes. even if the disks and cassettes are in good condition, the equipment needed to run them is now mostly found only in museums.cerf warns that important political and historical documents will also be lost to bit rot. in 2005, american historian doris kearns goodwin wrote team of rivals: the political genius of abraham lincoln. she went to libraries around the us, found the physical letters of the people involved and reconstructed their conversations. “in today’s world, those letters would be emails and the chances of finding them will be incredibly small one hundred years from now,” said cerf.he concedes that historians will take steps to preserve material considered important by today’s standards. but he argues that the significance of documents and correspondence is often not fully appreciated until hundreds of years later. historians have learned how archimedes, the greatest mathematician of antiquity, considered the concept of infinity and anticipated calculus in 3bc after his writings were found hidden under the words of a thirteenth-century prayer book. “we’ve been surprised by what we’ve learned about an earlier civilizations from objects that have been preserved only by chance,” he said.researchers in pittsburgh have made progress towards finding a solution to bit rot. digital snapshots of computer hard drives are taken while they run different software programs. these can then be uploaded to a computer that copies the one the software ran on. the result is a computer that can read defunct files.inventing new technology is only half the battle, though. it could be even more difficult to obtain the legal permissions to copy and store software before it dies. when it companies go out of business, they may sell the rights to someone else, which makes it very difficult to get approval. “to do this properly, the rights of preservation might need to be incorporated into our thinking about things like copyright and patents and licensing. we’re talking about preserving them for hundreds to thousands of years,” said cerf.
intermediate	organic food has more of the antioxidants linked to better health than regular food, and lower levels of toxic metals and pesticides, according to the most comprehensive scienti c analysis so far. the international team behind the work suggests that switching to organic fruit and vegetables could give the same bene ts as adding one or two portions of the recommended ô ve a dayõ fruit and vegetables.the team, led by professor carlo leifert, concludes that there are òstatistically signi cantó differences, with a range of antioxidants being òsubstantially higheró ð between 19% and 69% ð in organic food. it is the  rst study to demonstrate clear differences between organic and conventional fruits, vegetables and cereals.the researchers say the increased levels of antioxidants are equivalent to òone to two of the  ve portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be signi cant in terms of human nutritionó.the  ndings will add to the controversy over organic food and whether it is better for people. tom sanders, a professor of nutrition at kingõs college london, said the research did show some differences. òbut the question is are they within natural variation? and are they nutritionally relevant? i am not convinced.ó he added, òleifert has had a lot of disagreements with a lot of people.ó he also said that research showed organic cereals have less protein than conventional crops.the results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 studies from around the world ð more than ever before ð which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit, vegetables and cereals. òthe important thing about this research is that it shatters the myth that how we farm does not affect the quality of the food we eat,ó said helen browning, chief executive of the soil association, which campaigns for organic farming.leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants òhave previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancersó. the researchers also found much higher levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, in conventional crops. pesticide residues were found on conventional crops four times more often than on organic food.the research is certain to be criticized: the inclusion of so many studies in the analysis could mean poor-quality work makes the results unreliable. also, the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in conventional produce were still far below recommended limits. but, the researchers say cadmium accumulates over time in the body and that some people may wish to avoid this, and that pesticide limits are set individually, not for the cocktail of chemicals used on crops.a further criticism of the research is that the differences seen may result from different climates, soil types and crop varieties, and not from organic farming. the greatest criticism, however, will be over the suggestions of possible health bene ts. the most recent major analysis, which included 223 studies in 2012, found little evidence. òthe published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are signi cantly more nutritious than conventional foods,ó it found.this was also the conclusion of earlier, smaller studies published in 2009 in a scienti c journal and by the uk food standards agency. the 2012 study did note that eating organic food might help people avoid pesticide residues. sanders said he was not persuaded by the new work. òyou are not going to be healthier if you eat organic food,ó he said. òwhat is most important is what you eat, not whether itõs organic or conventional. itõs whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all.óopinion polls show healthy eating (55%) and avoiding chemical residues (53%) are key reasons given by shoppers for buying organic produce. but, many also say care for the environment (44%) and animal welfare (31%) are important, and also taste (35%). browning said: òthis research con rms what people think about organic food. in other countries, there have, for a long time, been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming. we hope these  ndings will bring the uk into line with the rest of europe.ónan
intermediate	the duke and duchess of cambridge won the first part of their battle for privacy when a french magazine was banned from selling or reusing photos of the couple at a private chateau in provence.french prosecutors must now decide if there should be criminal proceedings against the magazine editor and the photographer or photographers who took the pictures of the duchess sunbathing topless while on holiday in the south of france.the tribunal de grande instance in nanterre, paris ordered the gossip magazine closer to give the couple the digital files of the pictures within 24 hours. the magazine will have to pay €10,000 for every day it does not give the couple the files.the court also ordered mondadori magazines france, closer’s publisher, to pay €2,000 of legal costs.“these photos, which showed the couple, partly naked on the terrace of a private home, surrounded by a park several hundred metres from a public road, are particularly intrusive,” the court said.the court decided that every time mondadori – the publishing company owned by former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi – publishes a photograph in the future in france, they will be fined €10,000.but the decision refers only to the 14 pictures that have already been published. closer’s editor has hinted she has other, more intimate pictures.the couple welcome the judge’s decision. a source said: “they always believed the law was broken and that they had a right to their privacy.” maud sobel, a lawyer for the royal couple in paris, described it as “a wonderful decision.”the royal couple are pleased with the decision, but they want there to be a much more public criminal prosecution for invasion of privacy against the magazine and photographer or photographers.paris police began an investigation on tuesday. under french law, if you invade someone’s privacy, you may have to spend a maximum of one year in prison and pay a fine of €45,000.this punishment would send a message to the world and, the couple hope, stop paparazzi from invading their privacy in the future.the irish daily star has also published the photos. and the mondadori-owned italian celebrity magazine chi published a special edition of 26 pages with the photos of the future queen.nannannannannan
intermediate	not many exercise classes have a tea break halfway through. but margaret allen’s does. after a gentle warm-up and a few quick exercises, the 93-year-old great-grandmother lets her group relax with a cup of tea and a quick rest.some of the class of eight look as if they need to rest more than others. allen herself, wearing a thick shirt, knitted waistcoat, slacks and sensible shoes, is not even sweating. despite an extremely painful trapped nerve in one leg and a knee in need of replacement, she looks like she could go on for hours.the general rule is that eating just before doing sport is not a good idea and especially not halfway through the class. but, on the afternoon i visit allen’s class in saltburn-by-the-sea near middlesbrough, slices of fruitcake are being passed around during the break. the cake has been baked to celebrate allen’s recent birthday by her 89-year-old sister, joan.the ladies have just finished their cake when allen is up again, leading the group through a lively scottish tune with lots of toe pointing and leg kicking. forty-five minutes later, the class is finally over.allen, a former volunteer with the charity red cross, has been leading classes in the north-east town for 45 years. she wasn’t particularly sporty at school, but she started playing the piano for a keep-fit class during the second world war and eventually took over in her 40s when the previous instructor retired.at one time, allen’s class had more than 18 regulars, each paying £1 a time. but, these days, the group is getting smaller – during the tea break, the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them had attended that week for one of the younger members of the group who had just died, aged 68.allen is the oldest, followed by her sister. the baby of the group is 60-year-old jean cunion, who is a bit embarrassed to admit that she is perhaps the least fit of the group. “i remember, the first time i came, margaret said, ‘who’s that huffing and panting?’ and i had to admit it was me.” ruth steere, 76, says allen always knows what’s going on, although her back is always to the class: “she always shouts at us if we go wrong. she’s remarkably good at knowing what we are doing.”allen, a keen dancer, has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor. instead, she choreographs her own moves based on five tapes from the bbc’s first ever fitness guru, eileen fowler. allen thinks her good health is largely a result of keeping busy, especially since her husband died in 1997. she started writing poetry when she was 80.“i write poems about everything. i’m a prolific writer. i just can’t stop,” she says, when she phones me a few days after the interview to read out a poem she has written about the joys of exercise. one of the class, 84-year-old former teacher winnie robertson, thinks the secret to staying fit is never letting yourself go: “use it or lose it, that’s what i say.”allen still plays the piano and gives speeches. she did a computer course when she was 88. ageing is no fun, she admits, reading me a few lines from a poem she has written called ‘that beast called age’. she happily remembers a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years ago, who said she couldn’t possibly be more than 78: “i said, ‘thank you, doctor. you can go now.’”she also has a no-nonsense attitude to weight gain: “i just think people shouldn’t eat too much. whenever i hear someone saying, ‘oh, i can’t lose weight’, i say: ‘sellotape.’” she mimes taping her mouth shut. “i said this just the other day to a big fat man. everything in moderation is my motto.”earlier in 2013, allen was watching the news and saw a woman being given the british empire medal. “she was saying: ‘i’m 80 and i’m the oldest fitness instructor in the country!’ i was thinking: ‘no, you’re not.’ but i shan’t be writing to buckingham palace.”nan
intermediate	if the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by just 25%, there would be enough food to feed all the people who are malnourished, according to the un. each year, 1.3bn tonnes of food, about a third of all that is produced, is wasted. this includes about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of  sh and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat. meanwhile, 795 million people suffer from severe hunger and malnutrition.the un identi es the problem of food waste as one of the great challenges to achieving food security. by 2050, food production will have to increase by 60%, compared to 2005 levels, to feed a growing global population. reducing food waste would help to meet future demand.the problem is global but appears in very different ways. in developing countries, there is a lot of òfood lossó, which is unintentional waste, often due to poor equipment, transportation and infrastructure. in wealthy countries, there are low levels of òfood lossó but high levels of òfood wasteó, which means food is thrown away by consumers because they have purchased too much or by retailers who reject food because of strict standards of appearance.in developed countries, consumers and retailers throw away between 30% and 40% of all food purchased, whereas, in poorer countries, only 5% to 16% of food is thrown away.òin the developing world, food waste is almost non-existent,ó says robert van otterdijk, coordinator of the un food and agriculture organizationõs save food programme. òfood waste is happening in countries where people can afford to throw away food. but, on the other hand, there are a lot of food losses in developing countries because of the underdeveloped conditions they have.óthe environmental impact of food loss and waste is high. the carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is estimated at 3.3 gigatonnes of co2 ð this means that, if food waste were a country, it would be the third highest emitter of greenhouse gases after the us and china. about 30% of available agricultural land is used to grow or farm food that is subsequently wasted. and more surface and groundwater is used to produce wasted food around the globe than is used for agriculture by any single country, including india and china.òclimate change is caused by our economy of production and consumption because it is out of balance with what the earth can provide,ó says van otterdijk. òproduction of food is one of the biggest production sectors in the world and, if one-third of all this is wasted, you can imagine what a huge effect this has on the natural resources ð on land, water, energy and greenhouse gas emissions.óthe places that waste the most food are the us, canada, australia and new zealand, where consumers waste 39% of all food purchased. next is europe, where about 31% of all food purchased by consumers is thrown away. in the uk, 15m tonnes of food is lost or wasted each year. british consumers throw away 4.2m tonnes of edible food each year. this means that 11.7% of all food purchased is wasted, which costs each family £700 a year.the foods most commonly found in british bins are bread, vegetables, fruit and milk. the most wasted food in the uk by weight is bread, with consumers throwing away 414,000 tonnes (22.4%) of all bread purchased. by percentage, the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads, of which consumers throw away 38% (64,000 tonnes) of all they buy.the uk has made progress in the past ten years after a campaign to reduce waste. van otterdijk says the uk has been very successful in combating food waste. between 2007 and 2012, the amount of food waste produced by uk households decreased by 21%, from 5.3m tonnes to 4.2m tonnes, largely due to greater awareness.van otterdijk says there has been a òvery encouraging, unexpected, continuing interestó in food waste and this enables campaigns around the world to gain momentum. òwe have to do much more and it needs the participation of public and private sectors,ó he says. òbut, if it continues like this, maybe, after ten years, weõll have globally signi cant results.ónan
intermediate	police and intelligence agencies around the world have, for almost 100 years, used lie detectors to help convict criminals or find spies and traitors.but the polygraph could soon be defunct. researchers in britain and the netherlands have developed a new method that has a success rate, in tests, of over 70%. this new method could be in use in police stations around the world within a decade. it doesn’t monitor facial tics, talking too much or waving of arms, which are all signs that someone is lying. the new method monitors full-body motion, which can show that the person is feeling guilty.the polygraph is widely used in the us in criminal cases and for security clearance for the fbi and cia but is much less popular in europe. many people in the scientific and legal communities do not believe that it is reliable. by contrast, the new method has performed well in experiments.the basic thought is that liars fidget more and so the use of an all-body motion suit – the kind used in films to create computer-generated characters – will record this. the suit has 17 sensors that register movement up to 120 times per second in three dimensions for 23 joints.one of the research team, ross anderson, professor of security engineering at cambridge university, said that years of research show that an interviewer will know whether someone is telling the truth, and not lies, in only about 55 times out of 100he said the new method, by contrast, was right over 70% of the time. and he was confident they would be able to do better. in some tests, the team has already achieved more than 80%.anderson said: “guilty people fidget more and we can measure this.”anderson added that the research had a special significance at this time because of a recent us senate report on torture by the cia. there are problems with torture from a moral point of view but it is also a very unreliable way of getting accurate information. “we have known for a long time that torture does not work,” anderson said. the new method offers a good alternative to interviews.the research paper was written by dr sophie van der zee of cambridge university, professor ronald poppe of utrecht university, professor paul taylor of lancaster university and anderson.the polygraph was created in 1921 by policeman john larson. it records changes in pulse, blood pressure, sweating and breathing to find out whether someone is lying.in movies, the polygraph is always right, but, in 1998, the us supreme court ruled that there was no consensus that the polygraph was reliable. this conclusion was supported by the us national academy of scientists in 2003.the experiment carried out by anderson and his colleagues involved 180 students and employees at lancaster university – half of the people were told to tell the truth and half to lie. they were each paid £7.50 for their participation in the 70-minute experiment, involving two tests.some were interviewed about a computer game never end, which they played for seven minutes. others lied about playing the game – they had only seen notes about it.the second test involved a lost wallet containing £5. some were asked to bring the wallet to a lost-and-found box. others hid it and lied about it.“overall, we correctly guessed whether 82.2% (truths: 88.9%; lies: 75.6%) of the interviewees were telling the truth or lying based on the movements in their individual limbs,” the report says.anderson said: “first, we looked at how much different body parts showed that someone was lying. we found that liars wave their arms more, but this is only at the 60% level that you can get from a polygraph.“the success came when we looked at total body motion. that tells truth from lies over 70% of the time and we believe we can improve it even more by combining it with optimal questioning techniques.”another advantage is that total body motion is mostly the same in people who have different cultural backgrounds and different levels of anxiety – these things confuse other lie-detection technologies, anderson said.the use of all-body suits is expensive – they cost about £30,000 – and they can be uncomfortable, so anderson and his colleagues are now studying low-cost alternatives. these include using motion-sensing technology from computer games, such as the kinect devices developed by microsoft for the xbox.anderson admits that intelligence agencies such as the cia could teach agents how to trick the full-body motion method by keeping their bodies completely still. but he said that in itself would be a giveaway.nannan
intermediate	jmw turner, one of britain’s greatest painters, will appear on the new £20 note, after a nationwide vote.it will be the first time an artist has appeared on a british banknote, after the governor of the bank of england, mark carney, asked the public to choose a deceased cultural figure they felt deserved to be on the banknote.turner, who is famous for his dramatic seascapes, beat off competition from 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, film-makers and actors put forward by 30,000 members of the public.the list included alfred hitchcock, alexander mcqueen, derek jarman, laura ashley, william morris and vanessa bell. this list was narrowed down to a final choice of five by a panel of artists, critics and historians.the final five – barbara hepworth, charlie chaplin, josiah wedgwood, william hogarth and turner – were chosen because of their “unquestioned” contribution to both the visual arts and british society, as well as their enduring influence.the announcement of the new banknote was made at the turner contemporary gallery in margate. the announcement was made jointly by carney and the artist tracey emin, who grew up in the town.carney said it had been “so important to get this right and have a proper process that involved the public.” he added that banknotes are not only a practical necessity – they “can be a piece of art in everyone’s pocket”.“the fact that we will have turner on the £20 note shows that the british people are a nation of people who appreciate creativity and appreciate the arts,” said emin.the note will show turner’s 1799 self-portrait, as well as one of his most famous works, the fighting temeraire, the ship that played an important role in nelson’s victory at the battle of trafalgar in 1805.the note will also contain a quote from the artist – “light is therefore colour” – as well as his signature. the signature is from his will, in which he left many of his paintings to the nation.historical figures were first shown on banknotes in 1970. turner joins winston churchill and jane austen as the significant figures who will feature on the new polymer notes – a plastic-type material – churchill on the £5 and austen on the £10 note. the new £20 note will be available by 2020.turner was born in 1775 in london, the son of a barber, and he entered the royal academy schools at the age of 14. in 1786, when he was sent to margate, his love of painting and drawing the north-east kent coast began. he returned to that coast throughout his life and it was where he painted some of his most dramatic oils and watercolours. he described its skies as “the loveliest in all europe”.turner was a very prolific artist – he produced more than 550 oil paintings and 2,000 watercolours in his lifetime. his life was also the subject of a film, in 2014, by mike leigh, with timothy spall as the artist.victoria pomery, the director of turner contemporary, said: “the decision to celebrate jmw turner, one of the greatest technical pioneers in the history of british art, is extraordinary. it has proven that turner is the nation’s favourite artist.”nannannannan
elementary	the huge fortunes made by the world’s richest 100 billionaires are making inequality worse and stopping the world from being able to reduce poverty, says oxfam.oxfam said the world could end poverty several times over if the richest 100 billionaires would give away the money they made in 2012.the charity said that the $240bn made in 2012 by the richest 100 billionaires would be enough to end extreme poverty four times over.it is unusual for charities to attack the wealthy, because they are usually seen as a source of money. bill gates and warren buffett are among a group of 40 us billionaires who have said they will give much of their money to aid projects, but there is little information about how much money they give each year.russian, middle eastern and chinese billionaires do not give away money to charity in the same way that us billionaires do.in the report, the charity asks world leaders to end income extremes and reduce inequality.the report said that the richest 1% of people have increased their incomes by 60% in the past 20 years.barbara stocking, oxfam’s chief executive, said: “we can no longer pretend that wealth for a few people will benefit many people – too often the opposite is true.”the report said the problem affected all parts of the world. “in the uk, inequality is returning to levels not seen since the nineteenth century. in china, the top 10% now earn nearly 60% of the income. chinese inequality levels are now similar to those in south africa, which is now the most unequal country on earth.”in the us, the share of national income that goes to the top 1% of people has doubled since 1980 from 10% to 20%, the report says.the richest 1% are estimated to cause 10,000 times more pollution than the average us citizen.oxfam said world leaders should learn from countries such as brazil, which has grown quickly and reduced inequality at the same time.stocking said that world leaders should agree to reduce inequality to the levels seen in 1990.she said closing tax havens, which hold as much as $31 trillion, or as much as a third of all global wealth, could collect $189bn in additional taxes.nannannan
elementary	we talked to five people who do some unusual jobs about how much they are paid, what the worst parts are and why they enjoy their work.1. dog-food taster the job: to taste dog food to make sure it is good quality.what this person does: opens tins of dog (or cat) food, smells it and eats it. “tasting is an important quality check to make sure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced,” says philip wells, the chief taster for lily’s kitchen pet food.typical salary: £20,000 for a job in the quality departmentworst part of the job: the deadlines. wells says he likes the food. the meat in pet food must come from animals that humans can safely eat. he also says: “there are some terrible pet foods. i don’t taste them but just the smell makes you feel sick.”job satisfaction: “every day is different.” wells likes knowing that he “helps pets to become happier and healthier”. but he says that someone else in the tasting team is also a very important member: lily, the dog.2. hygiene technician the job: to clean areas that might be dangerous to humanswhat this person does: cleans up crime scenes, road accidents and suicides. clears houses full of rubbish, rats and excrement … and other things, too. “the job is to keep people safe,” says richard lewis, a hygiene technician for rentokil. “we work in some very, very dirty places.”typical salary: when you start, the salary is usually around £14,500. a top salary can be up to £22,000.worst part of the job: cleaning up after suicides. “you get used to the job being disgusting. but the emotional side of the job is still hard,” he says. “you also need to have a sense of humour because some days can be difficult.”job satisfaction: lewis finds the variety of tasks exciting. “one day, i’m cleaning up after a dead body; another day, i’m in a prison cell. it’s satisfying to make a dangerous place safe again.” he says.3. biogas engineer the job: to set up biogas plants in developing countrieswhat this person does: helps poor people produce biogas from their excrement and other waste products. this is done by linking a system to toilets. poor people can use the gas for cooking and lighting.typical salary: when you start, the salary is around £10,000. a typical salary for a chief technical officer is £30,000.worst part of the job: for baburam paudel, chief technical officer in nepal for the charity renewable world, the worst part is seeing people struggling to survive on very little money. “unsurprisingly, the smell of the waste products can be disgusting. it smells like rotten eggs.”job satisfaction: “i find it very satisfying to know that i am helping people to earn more money and also allowing girls to go to school because they don’t need to collect firewood,” says paudel. “my work improves the health and hygiene of whole communities.”4. eel ecologist the job: to help the critically endangered european eel to survivewhat this person does: checks the size of the endangered eels. they do this by walking into the thames and other london rivers, which are full of eels. in the rivers, they put their hands into a net filled with up to 20 adult eels and pull an eel out. “adult eels can be a metre long, or even larger, and weigh up to 2kg. they’re not dangerous but they are almost 100% muscle and they can be a little bit slimy,” says stephen mowat, an eel ecologist for the zoological society of london. “we have to weigh and measure them and they wriggle … a lot. i look silly when i’m crawling on the ground chasing an eel across the grass.”worst part of the job: “eels are really difficult animals to work with” says mowat. but, for mowat, the worst part o f the job is not the eels – he believes baby eels are “as cute as pandas”: “the worst thing about the job is seeing how much damage humans do to the environment.”job satisfaction: “working outside and seeing british wildlife really close is the best part of the job,” says mowat. “eels are beautiful animals and working with eels helps whole river systems. that is a great thing to do.”5. shopping channel presenter the job: to sell and demonstrate lots of different products on live tvwhat this person does: presents hours and hours of boring tv and, at the same time, demonstrates the products and looks enthusiastic about everything that they are selling. “i prepare and research as much information as possible on every product,” says shaun ryan, presenter for ideal world tv.typical salary: when you start, the salary is a minimum of £30,000. an experienced presenter can get over £55,000.worst part of the job: “working at unusual hours of the day,” says ryan. “an experienced presenter like me has to work weekends and very late evenings. and, sometimes, i have to start work at five in the morning.”job satisfaction: “i love presenting live tv and having to think quickly,” says ryan. “i also love knowing that, at times, thousands of people are buying the product that i have just presented.”
elementary	as soon as the children at a primary school in stirling, scotland, hear the words òdaily mileó, they leave the classroom and start running around the school  eld. for three-and-a-half years, all the pupils at st ninianõs primary school have walked or run a mile each day. they do it at different times during the day. there has been an increase in obesity in children in the uk but none of the children at this school are overweight.the daily mile has done a lot to improve these childrenõs  tness, behaviour and concentration in lessons so many other british schools are doing the same. their children also get up from their desks and take 15 minutes to walk or run round the school or local park.elaine wyllie, headteacher of st ninianõs, said: òi get at least two emails a day from other schools and local authorities asking how we do it. the thought of children across the country running every day because of something weõve done is amazing.óone in ten children are obese when they start school at the age of four or  ve, say the health & social care information centre. and, in the summer of 2015, a study found that schoolchildren in england are more un t than they have ever been. for this reason, primary schools can see the bene ts of the daily mile. it has been introduced in schools in various parts of the uk and other schools are planning to introduce it soon. just in stirling, 30 schools have already started or are going to start the daily mile.òrunning is a good way to improve childrenõs  tness, and itõs free and easy. the most important thing is that the children really enjoy it. if they didnõt enjoy it, you couldnõt continue with it. they come back inside with bright eyes and rosy cheeks. itõs how children used to look,ó said wyllie. at st ninianõs, teachers take their pupils out of lessons to the schoolõs playing  eld for their daily mile at a time that suits that dayõs timetable. only ice or very heavy rain stop them.researchers from stirling university have begun a study to look for evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile. dr colin moran, who is leading the study, said: òthe children donõt seem to have problems with obesity; they seem happier and teachers say they learn better. so we designed a study that tests all of these things.ó they will compare st ninianõs pupils with children from another school in stirling where children havenõt started running yet.kevin clelland, a primary school teacher from leeds, visited st ninianõs. then, he convinced the other teachers in his school that it was a great idea. he said: òitõs such a simple thing to do but seems to have such an amazing impact. we really want to improve the  tness of our pupils.ó his school is now building a running track.paralympian, tanni grey-thompson, chair of ukactive, a health organization for physical activity, said: òall children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day ð this can be in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground. itõs fantastic to see ideas like the daily mile. it shows that schools want to improve childrenõs  tness and their cognitive behaviour, and make a real difference to schools, teachers, parents and young peopleõs lives. we know sitting still kills; not sitting still helps children build skills that will help them for the rest of their lives.óthe scottish government also supports the idea. a spokesperson said: òlearning in pe is improved by ideas like the daily mile, which can help parents keep their children healthy. we are pleased to see that so many scottish schools are taking part or want to.ónan
elementary	facebook has lost millions of users every month in its biggest markets. in the last six months, facebook has lost nearly 9 million monthly visitors in the us and 2 million in the uk.it has stopped growing in the us, uk and other major european countries. in the last month, the world’s largest social network lost 6 million us visitors, a 4% fall. in the uk, 1.4 million fewer users went on facebook last month, a fall of 4.5%.people are also using facebook less in canada, spain, france, germany and japan.“the problem is that, in the us and uk, most people who want to join facebook have already done it,” said new media specialist ian maude at enders analysis. people get bored, he says, and they “like to try something new”.other social networks are also very popular with younger people. instagram, the photo-sharing site, got 30 million new users in the 18 months before facebook bought the business.path, the mobile phone-based social network started by ex-facebook employee dave morin, is gaining 1 million users a week. it now has more than 9 million users. 500,000 venezuelans downloaded the app in just one weekend.facebook is still growing fast in south america. the number of users in brazil increased by 6% in the last month to 70 million, according to socialbakers, whose information is used by facebook advertisers. and there has been a 4% rise in india to 64 million users – still only a small part of the country’s population, so there is the possibility for more growth.global numbers of visitors to facebook reached 1.05 billion a month in january, but they fell by 20 million in february. numbers rose again in april. the social network has now lost nearly 2 million visitors in the uk since december, with its 27 million total the same as a year ago.the number of minutes americans spend on facebook is falling, too. the total was 121 billion minutes in december 2012, but that fell to 115 billion minutes in february.as facebook has already said, we spend less time using facebook on our personal computers because we now prefer to use our smartphones and tablets.wall street expects facebook’s income this quarter to be $1.44 billion, an increase from $1.06 billion a year ago.the company said that it might be losing “younger users” because they now prefer to use “other products and services similar to, or as an alternative to, facebook”.facebook founder mark zuckerberg has created some new initiatives for smartphone users in the last year. one initiative, facebook home, is software that you can download onto android phones to feed news and photos from friends – and advertising – directly to your home screen.nannannannannan
elementary	emmanuel limal wanted to find love on online dating sites but he was tired of meeting women who said that they weren’t ready to start a family. the 43-year-old actor, who is from france, has lived in copenhagen for 20 years. he was looking for love and wanted to start a family. he tried to find someone online but without success.“everyone said that they were really active, always travelling or with a long list of hobbies, but they didn’t talk about children,” limal said. “on some sites, there was an option to click saying: ‘i’d like kids someday,’ but i read the person’s profile and thought: ‘you will never have time!’ if someone’s going to the gym eight times a week and travelling every month, they are not putting a family first.”limal has a six-year-old daughter from an old relationship but he has always wanted more children. “i couldn’t meet anyone who wanted to start a family”. he said it was difficult to know when to talk about wanting kids when he met someone new. “it’s a difficult subject to talk about when you are on a date,” he said. “then one day i read a profile from a 38-year-old who said she knew it was ‘really bad to admit’ but she wanted children. and i thought: ‘you shouldn’t be ashamed of this.’”limal borrowed money to start babyklar.nu – or ‘baby-ready now’ in english. it works like a normal dating site but everyone is asked to be honest about their wish to start a family soon. “we ask people if they are ok with someone who already has children and if they want another baby,” limal said. “but we don’t make them say how many children they would like. that would be like food shopping online.”he has had a very positive response to the site. “fifty people signed up every hour when we started in june. there are already couples who met through the site and are now together. i think we will have the first babyklar.nu baby by next summer.” more men have signed up than women (53% to 47%), with comments such as “i can finally be honest about what i want.”the site has come at the right time for the country of five million people. danes are not having enough children and the current rate of 1.7 children per family means that the population is falling. the usual reasons are given – women are leaving it “too late” and couples are living together without getting married and waiting to start families.“now, i hope, men and women who want to start a family but haven’t met the right person yet will have another choice,” says limal. he says that this isn’t just about making babies: “i want this to be about children and love. my goal is to bring together people who really want a family and a partner – and who’ll stay together. i’m a romantic.”he is planning to start sites in france and the uk later in 2013, but at the moment the only site is in denmark. “danes have no problem having children before marriage so things can move fast and, because the country’s so small, someone from jutland can date someone from copenhagen without too much travel,” limal said. and limal has finally found love. “i’ve met a nice woman and she wants a baby too – so we shall see.”
elementary	europe is trying to reduce air pollution. europe will become the first part of the world to force car makers to use ‘real-world’ emissions tests. new regulations will introduce tests that will demonstrate clearly what cars’ emissions are like when they are driving on roads and in traffic, not in ideal conditions, similar to a laboratory.the european commission has approved the tests. the tests will make sure all cars meet a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre. at present, only one car in 16 meets this limit. other countries, such as china and korea, are also considering real-world emissions tests. they will watch what happens next closely.in the uk, 29,000 people die every year because of pollution. pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide are responsible for at least one quarter of those deaths.the current laboratory test for measuring emissions is 25 years old and it needs to change. car makers can cheat during the tests on their cars using various techniques. for example, they can tape up doors and windows to reduce air resistance, drive on really smooth roads and test at very high temperatures.“the commission will introduce a new emissions test that will properly check the cars in real driving,” said lucia caudet, a commission spokesperson.“one key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 european citizens each year is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars – this causes much more pollution on the road,” said greg archer, the clean vehicles manager for transport and environment. “the development of a new, real-world driving emission test is an important step towards reducing air pollution in cities. european union (eu) states should now support the commission’s idea. they should ignore the complaints from car makers, who say that the rules are too tough.”according to research by the international council on clean transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg per kilometre standard and some cars are 22 times above the recommended limit. about one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport – mostly diesel – and, in cities, concentrations can be as high as 64%, according to european environment agency data.campaigners say that car makers have tried to delay reforms to car tests. but car makers do not agree – they say that they need five years to introduce the changes for technical and economic reasons. “real driving emissions is a totally new regulation that will force significant changes,” said cara mclaughlin, a spokesperson for the european automobile manufacturers association (acea). “but acea fully accepts that the regulation will apply to new types of cars from september 2017.”when eu representatives finally agreed a regulation for nitrogen oxide limits – with stricter road trials and monitoring of exhaust fumes – acea sent the european commission their own draft regulation. acea’s draft regulation covered fewer pollutants and they wanted to introduce the regulation only in 2020. it included shorter test distances (from 1,300 metres to below 700 metres), raised minimum temperatures from -7c to -3c and wanted to use more country roads for the tests.the commission rejected acea’s draft regulation. the new regulation will now probably be introduced in september. by 2017, the first real-world car emissions tests should begin. countries around the world will watch the introduction of the eu’s new emissions tests carefully.
elementary	in the west, people do not usually eat insects. but in some parts of the world, insects are an important food and in spring 2013 there will be an effort to show people that eating insects is not disgusting. and we may soon be able to buy insects in supermarkets.in april, there will be a festival in london, pestival 2013, where there will be a discussion about the question of eating insects. the festival will include a restaurant by the nordic food lab, the scandinavian team behind the danish restaurant noma, which brought extremely popular insect dishes to claridge’s hotel in london in 2013.noma has been named the best restaurant in the world by restaurant magazine for three years. its chef, rené redzepi, says that ants taste like lemon, and a mixture of grasshoppers and moth larvae tastes like a strong fish sauce. bee larvae make a sweet mayonnaise used instead of eggs and scientists find new ways to use insects all the time.in march, a bbc documentary will show a food writer eating deep-fried locusts and barbecued spiders. but, behind all the jokes there is a very serious message. many experts believe that if humans eat insects, it will be very good for the environmentthe un’s food and agriculture organization (fao) gives money to projects that show people they can eat and farm insects in south-east asia and africa. in these places about two billion people already eat insects and larvae as a normal part of their diet. in 2012, the fao published a list of 1,909 edible species of insect and plans a major international conference on “this valuable food source” in 2013.there are lots of insects – there are 40 tonnes of insects for every person in the world – so they will not become endangered. “i know it’s taboo to eat bugs in the west, but why not?”, redzepi said. “you go to south-east asia and this is a common thing. you read about it from all over the world, that people are eating insects. we eat honey, and honey is the vomit of a bee. think of that next time you put it into your tea.”he said that the basic idea behind nordic food lab is that you can eat everything.insects are very important to life on earth and they are the most diverse group of animals on the planet: there are more than a million species. but most people hate them and often kill them.in the next 30 years, the planet’s human population will increase to nine billion. already one billion people do not get enough food. the increase will put more pressure on agricultural land, water, forests, fisheries and resources, and also food and energy supplies.the cost of meat is increasing – it costs more money now, but also people have to destroy a lot of rainforest to make fields or to grow food for cows. cows also make methane. the farming of cows, pigs and sheep makes very big amounts of greenhouse gases – 35% of the planet’s methane, 65% of its nitrous oxide and 9% of the carbon dioxide.edible insects make fewer gases, contain high-quality protein, vitamins and amino acids, and only need a quarter of the food that sheep need to make the same amount of protein. you can grow them on organic waste. china is already building huge maggot farms. zimbabwe is growing caterpillars and laos is developing an insect-harvesting project. one study says that eating crickets and locusts, and not eating pork and beef, could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95%.nan
elementary	you’ve spent eight hours in the office. you’ve finished the most important work of the day. this is the time when most workers would think about going home.but, for millions of japanese employees, if they leave work and arrive home in time for dinner, people say that they are disloyal to their company.but now, the government is trying to do something about japan’s culture of overwork. it wants to make workers take at least five days’ paid holiday a year.japanese employees are allowed an average of 18.5 days’ paid holiday a year. companies must allow them a minimum of ten days’ paid holiday, plus 15 one-day national holidays. but very few employees take these days. most take only nine days of holiday, according to the labour ministry. many british workers think that a two-week summer holiday is their right but workers in japan think that a four-night vacation in hawaii is a big self-indulgence.by 2020, the government hopes that the law will make japanese employees follow the example of british workers, who take an average of 20 days’ paid annual leave, and workers in france, who take an average of 25.japan’s employees are respected and admired in the rest of the world for their commitment to the company. but they often have no time for anything else.couples don’t have time to start families. so, japan has a low birth rate and the population is declining. more employees are falling ill from stress or even dying through overwork.about 22% of japanese work more than 49 hours a week, compared with 16% of us workers and 11% in france and germany, according to data from the japanese government.“nobody else uses their vacation days,” says erika sekiguchi, a 36-year-old worker. she spends 14 hours a day at work and used only eight of her 20 days of paid vacation in 2014, six of which were sick leave.yuu wakebe, who works at the health ministry, admits that he does 100 hours of overtime a month. “it is a worker’s right to take paid vacations,” wakebe said. “but workers in japan have to do a lot of extra work for no money.”workers are scared that their colleagues will think they are not working hard enough. this is one reason for a rise in stress-related illness, early death and suicide. about 200 people die every year from heart attacks and strokes in japan, caused by long hours and hard work.nannannannan
elementary	a new report says that almost one billion people will remain in extreme poverty by 2030 if countries donõt try to solve the social, economic and cultural problems that keep them poor. the report by the chronic poverty advisory network says that many people may rise above the poverty line of $1.25 a day, but fall back again when they have problems such as drought or illness and insecurity or con ict.the report found that, in parts of rural kenya and in south africa, 30 to 40% of people who escaped from poverty fell back again. this percentage rose to 60% in some areas of ethiopia between 1999 and 2009. even in successful countries such as indonesia and vietnam, the proportion was 20%.individual examples show how easy it is for people to fall back into poverty. amin is from a village in bangladesh. his income has fallen slowly, because of his illness and his wifeõs illness, the cost of his sonõs marriage, the death of his father and loss of goods such as  shing nets. lovemore, from zimbabwe, is now one of the poorest people in his village. he recently lost his job because of ill health and has to look after his  ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters.òwe need to make sure that people who come out of poverty remain above the poverty line permanently. too many families return to poverty when they have personal or bigger problems. governments shouldnõt assume that, just because somebodyõs income hits $1.25, that means the problem is solved,ó said andrew shepherd, the main author of the report.according to the un, the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 is still possible. but the report says that countries need to make changes to achieve zero poverty. there was a drop in extreme poverty from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 1.2 billion in 2010, but the report says that progress in the next 15 years will be much more dif cult. there has been a lot of progress in china but there will probably not be similar progress in other parts of the world.the report says countries should try to help the chronically poor ð those who are poor for many years or their entire lives ð and stop people becoming poor. ògovernments have been quite good at moving people over the poverty line because that is quite easy. but they have avoided the more dif cult job of trying to reduce chronic poverty,ó said shepherd.the report says progress on poverty reduction has helped people who were already closer to the poverty line, but has helped the chronically poor much less. it will not be possible to get to zero poverty if development policies donõt focus on the chronically poor, it adds. the report suggests three ideas. they all cost a lot of money.the  rst is social help ð to bring the poorest people closer to a good-enough standard of living. the second is education, from early childhood to the start of work, so people can escape and stay out of poverty. the third is economic growth policies that make sure that the bene ts of increasing national wealth reach the poorest people.all this will cost money and the report says higher taxes will be necessary. aid will also be necessary for the start-up costs for social assistance, healthcare for everyone and to  nance education. òthere remains a huge role for aid in the next 20 years, as many developing countries spend less than $500 on each of their citizens a year. even nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per person,ó shepherd said.the authors say governments should have a national development plan and make sure the poorest people are represented politically as well as trying to stop dif cult social customs, such as dowries and witchcraft, that make extreme poverty worse.nannannannan
elementary	on the top of a hill, above northumberland’s beautiful kielder water lake, a group of people are waiting in a car park next to a strange wooden building. they are here because of the darkness and this is kielder observatory, the centre of britain’s latest industry – astrotourism. the people who are waiting outside are lucky. many more people apply for a night of stargazing at the observatory but not everyone can come because numbers are strictly limited.inside, the observatory’s founder and lead astronomer, gary fildes, speaks to his colleagues and volunteers. the team discusses that they might see the northern lights but fildes doesn’t think they will. instead, they decide to use their powerful telescopes to look at jupiter and venus and, later, to find stars such as capella and betelgeuse. an extra attraction is the appearance of the international space station.fildes is a leading figure in the uk’s growing astrotourism industry. the key moment for northumberland came in 2013 when the entire national park, about 1,500 square kilometres in area, got dark sky park status. it is the only one in england. dark sky parks are rare. research in 2013 showed that only 5% of the uk population can see more than 31 stars on a clear night.the international dark-sky association (ida) gives the status of dark sky park only to places that take big steps to prevent light pollution. the areas must also prove their night skies are very dark. in northumberland dark sky park, it is so dark that venus casts a shadow on the earth.duncan wise, visitor development officer for the northumberland national park, helped to lead the campaign for dark-sky status. “we usually think that ‘landscape’ is everything up to the horizon,” wise said. “but what about what’s above the horizon?” wise and others spent years preparing their application to the ida – they collected thousands of light readings.because of their hard work, many of the 1.5 million tourists who visit northumberland each year are now aware of its dark sky status. “a lot of people come here to see the sky now,” says a man who works for a local car-hire company. “they come in autumn and winter, when it’s darkest. it’s good for the local hotels because tourists come all year round now.”wise agrees that northumberland needs to do more to take advantage of its dark skies, which are very rare. he believes the region needs more observatories to make sure that visitors will see what they came for. a new £14-million national landscape discovery centre will have an observatory when it is completed in a couple of years.fildes has big ambitions. he is planning britain’s first “astrovillage” – it would have the largest public observatory in the world, a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes. the multimillion-pound project would also have a hotel and attract 100,000 visitors a year – that is four times the number that are currently able to use the observatory.however, northumberland has competition. galloway forest park in scotland also has dark sky park status. exmoor in south-west england became europe’s first international dark sky reserve – one level below dark sky park – in 2011. a number of local businesses there now offer stargazing holidays. the uk is not as good as northern chile, which has more than ten tourist observatories and some of the clearest skies in the world.so, why do people want to look at the night sky? the media have helped. tv programmes about astronomy have attracted a new generation of stargazers. technology has also made astronomy more popular. apps such as stellarium now turn smartphones into pocket-size planetariums. but fildes believes that, most importantly, people are starting to appreciate the sky. “if you had to build a visitor attraction from the beginning, what could be better than the universe?”nan
advanced	he had the tastes of a typical millionaire. he owned a gold and silver rolex and a fleet of expensive cars. he liked to dabble in modern art. but, although this chinese businessman had several companies and a palatial villa in the madrid suburbs, he had almost no money in the bank, a detail that piqued the interest of spanish authorities.gao ping, who had lived most of his adult life in spain, had a monopoly on supplies to 4,000 chinese bazaars across the mediterranean country. but, authorities suspected he was not paying taxes on the clothes, furniture and other goods he was importing from china.when police swooped on his warehouses in 2012 they found piles of cash: wads of €100, €200 and €500 notes were wrapped in elastic bands. around €12m was wheeled away in trolleys, the largest ever cash seizure by spanish police. the gang, with gao the alleged ringleader, stands accused of laundering up to €300m a year, as well as selling counterfeit goods and toys with fake safety marks. the government prosecutor said gao’s illegal business was so big it was damaging the competitiveness of spain. gao is on bail; the case has not yet come to trial.law enforcement officials have long had concerns about €500 notes. small and easy to transport relative to their value, they are the payment method of choice for tax dodgers, money launderers and drug barons. the sum of €1m in €500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag, where the same amount in €50 notes would require a small suitcase. cash mules have been known to fold the notes into plastic pellets and swallow them. a less dangerous method of concealment is to stuff the banknotes into a car chassis.the uk stopped distribution of the €500 note in 2010 on the grounds that demand for it was “almost entirely for criminal purposes”. in 2009, italy’s central bank warned that the notes were widely used by mafia money launderers and terrorists. other countries have limited their own highdenomination notes due to links to organized crime – canada scrapped its $1,000 note in 2000 on the advice of law enforcement officers.in an age of electronic payment systems and contactless cards, more are questioning whether printing these notes can be justified. peter sands, the former head of standard chartered bank, has called for the abolition of high-denomination notes, including the €500, the $100, the 1,000 swiss franc note and the £50. in a report for the harvard kennedy school of government, sands argued it was time to get rid of high-value notes that make life easier for “bad guys” pursuing tax evasion, financial crime, terrorist finance and corruption. although criminals would switch to smallerdenomination bills, or gold or diamonds, these substitutes are bulkier and more traceable, making it more likely they will get caught, he said.at a conference on terrorist financing in london, the head of europol, rob wainwright, called on the european central bank (ecb) to look at whether it “should continue to produce and circulate these notes that make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide their business and to fund illegal activities”. according to europol, the purple €500 note accounts for 30% of the value of all the euro notes in circulation, although most people have never seen one.the €500 note was introduced in 2002 when the euro was born: it replaced the 1,000 deutschmark, the 10,000 belgian franc and the 500,000 italian lira. several european countries favoured highvalue banknotes. “it is definitely a preference that has been there for a long time,” says pia hüttl, an affiliate fellow at the bruegel thinktank. “the preference is based on the idea that cash has a lower cost and is accepted everywhere.”cash remains king in germany and austria, where more than half of all transactions are made with paper money and coins. the former president of germany’s constitutional court, hans-jürgen papier, told germany’s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that restrictions on cash were at odds with individual freedom, while tabloid newspaper bild has launched a petition in defence of paper money, including the €500 note – “hands off my cash”.law enforcement authorities are less convinced, amid a steady stream of reports of suspicious bundles of cash. in one case that has caught the attention of police, two men walked into a bank and tried to deposit €200,000 of torn and muddy €500 notes. in the same week, €1.3m in €500 notes was found stuffed in the false bottom of suitcase. but, a suspicion of criminality is not enough to keep people in custody. “our frustration from a law enforcement perspective is that, in many jurisdictions, it is impossible to provide sufficient evidence to satisfy judicial authorities of a link between suspicious cash detections and criminality,” says jennifer macleod, a specialist in europol’s financial intelligence group. “the search for these links is complicated further through time constraints and fragmented cooperation and information exchange.”the agency would like to see central banks take more responsibility for the “striking anomalies” in the use of €500 notes. luxembourg, for example, issued more than twice its annual gdp in banknotes in 2013 alone, despite being one of the most cash-averse countries in europe. europol asked luxembourg’s central bank to explain. “the reply we had from luxembourg is that they simply issue the notes requested and have no explanation for the reasons behind the demand,” macleod says. “i find it surprising that a central bank does not consider itself to have a responsibility in this area.”this could be changing. mario draghi, the head of the ecb, has said he is determined that the income the bank generates from issuing the notes should not be “a comfort for criminals”. other members of the ecb’s top team, such as yves mersch, contend there is no evidence about the criminal uses of the €500 note. but, amid heightened fears about terrorism, this argument may no longer cut any ice. eu finance ministers have called on policymakers to explore “appropriate restrictions” on high-value notes and report back by 1 may 2016.
advanced	wales will become the first country in the uk where people will be presumed to have consented for their organs to be donated unless they opt out.the welsh assembly has voted to adopt the opt-out policy, which will allow hospitals to act on the assumption that people who die want to donate unless they have specifically registered an objection.the final stage of a bill to adopt a system of presumed consent was passed by 43 votes to eight, with two abstentions, in spite of objections from religious groups on moral grounds and concerns that the scheme could add to the distress of grieving families.“this is a huge day for wales, for devolution and, most importantly, for the 226 people in wales waiting for an organ transplant,” said the welsh health minister, mark drakeford.“i am proud that wales will be the first nation in the uk to take this step. as a society, we have shown we are prepared to take action to increase organ donation and to provide hope to those people waiting every week for a transplant.“family refusal is a major factor that affects the numbers of organ donations and the main reason for refusal is lack of knowledge of their loved one’s wishes.“the family of the potential donor has a major role to play in organ donation. the aim of the bill has always been to respect the wishes of the deceased; however, relatives or friends may object to consent being deemed based on what they know about the views of the deceased.“when family members know that organ donation is what the deceased would have wanted, they usually agree to participate in the donation process. the new law will work by clarifying people’s wishes around the issue of organ donation and, in turn, increase the rate of consent to donation.“today is a landmark day for wales and i expect the rest of the uk to be watching with great interest when the legislation is implemented in 2015.”the issue is controversial, with opponents worried that the pressing need for more kidneys and hearts will lead to the wishes of those who have died and their family being overruled. but ministers insist there will be safeguards.inevitably, some people will not get around to registering their opposition. in response to concerns, the government recently announced that families would play a bigger role.relatives are to have a “clear right of objection”, giving them the chance to show that the deceased would not have wanted to be an organ donor.wales has acted because of an acute shortage of organs. “we have the enduring problem of not having enough organs for people who need them,” said drakeford. “about one person every week dies in wales while on a waiting list. we have been working to improve the rate of organ donation and have had some success, but we’re looking to take the next step forward.“around a third of the welsh population is on the organ donor register, but well over twothirds in surveys say they are happy to be organ donors. that other third is people who don’t get round to putting their names down. we’re hoping to make inroads into that.”the new law would apply to anybody over 18 who has lived in wales for at least the year before his or her death. donated organs would not only go to people in need of a transplant in wales but to anybody in the uk.doctors are delighted at the move. the british medical association has long campaigned for an opt-out system because of its concern over the growing number of people needing transplants – a result of medical progress in transplantation.the number of young donors dropped substantially when seatbelt legislation came in. big efforts have been made in recent years to increase the number of those who carry an organ donation card, with a good deal of success. hospitals have also brought in improved systems for coordinating transplants, including the crucial discussions with relatives when there is no indication of the wishes of the deceased. but the increase in numbers of organs harvested is still not enough.some religious groups, on the other hand, strongly oppose the scheme, arguing that it would cause further distress to bereaved relatives. members of the muslim council of wales and the south wales jewish representative council have expressed reservations, while the archbishop of wales, barry morgan, said that “donation ought to be a gift of love, of generosity. if organs can be taken unless someone has explicitly registered an objection, that’s not an expression of love. it’s more a medical use of a body.”
advanced	until the last, david bowie, who has died of cancer, was still capable of springing surprises. his latest album, blackstar, appeared on his 69th birthday on 8 january 2016 and proved that his gift for making dramatic statements as well as challenging, disturbing music hadn’t deserted him.throughout the 1970s, bowie was a trailblazer of musical trends and pop fashion. having been a late-60s mime and cabaret entertainer, he evolved into a singer-songwriter, a pioneer of glam-rock, then veered into what he called “plastic soul”, before moving to berlin to create innovative electronic music. his capacity for mixing brilliant changes of sound and image underpinned by a genuine intellectual curiosity is rivalled by few in pop history.bowie was born david robert jones in south london. in 1953, the family moved to kent, where david showed aptitude in singing and playing the recorder. later, he studied art, music and design. in 1961, david’s mother bought him a plastic saxophone, introducing him to an instrument which would become a recurring ingredient in his music.at 15, david formed his first band, the kon-rads. it was clear that david’s talents and ambition dictated that he should go solo. david adopted the name bowie to avoid confusion with davy jones of the monkees.bowie’s first album, released in june 1967, was titled simply david bowie. in july 1969, bowie released space oddity, the song that would give him his initial commercial breakthrough. timed to coincide with the apollo 11 moon landing, it was a top five uk hit.in march 1970, bowie married art student, angela barnett. artistically, bowie was powering ahead. the man who sold the world was released in the us in late 1970 and in the uk the following year, and with its daring songwriting and broody, hard-rock sound, it was the first album to do full justice to his writing and performing gifts. the album’s themes included immortality, insanity, murder and mysticism, evidence that bowie was a songwriter who was thinking way beyond pop’s usual boundaries.he followed it with 1972’s hunky dory, a mix of wordy, elaborate songwriting. it was an excellent collection that met with only moderate success but that all changed with the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars later that year.this time, bowie emerged as a fully fledged science-fiction character – an intergalactic glam-rock star visiting a doomed planet earth – and the album effectively wrote the script for his own stardom. the hit single starman brought instant success for the album, while bowie’s ravishing stage costumes and provocative performances triggered fan enthusiasm unseen since beatlemania.everything bowie touched turned to gold. he had his first uk number 1 album with aladdin sane (1973), which generated the hit singles the jean genie and drive-in saturday. but bowie was already planning fresh career moves.his increasing interest in funk and soul music came to the fore on the deliciously listenable young americans (1975), which gave him a us chart-topper with fame (featuring john lennon as a guest vocalist).station to station (1976) introduced a new persona, the thin white duke, which bowie had carried over from his headlining performance as a melancholy space traveller in nicolas roeg’s film the man who fell to earth.bowie’s relationship with his wife had been disintegrating under the pressures of success and the couple divorced in 1980. this was a year of further creative triumph, bringing a fine album, scary monsters (and super creeps), and its spinoff chart-topping single, ashes to ashes, followed by bowie’s well-received stint as john merrick in the elephant man on the broadway stage.he achieved a number 1 single with his 1981 partnership with queen, under pressure, while becoming increasingly involved in crossovers between different media. he appeared in the german movie christiane f (1981) and wrote music for the soundtrack. he had another chart hit with cat people (putting out fire) from paul schrader’s movie cat people (1982).bowie continued to make progress as a screen actor with appearances in the hunger and the second world war drama merry christmas, mr lawrence, both released in 1983. musically, this was the year in which he put his energy into an all-out commercial onslaught with the album let’s dance and follow-up concerts. let’s dance moulded bowie into a crowd-friendly global rock star, with the album and its singles let’s dance, china girl and modern love all becoming huge international hits.this was the heyday of mtv and bowie’s knack for eye-catching videos fuelled this commercial splurge, while the six-month serious moonlight tour drew massive crowds. it was to be the most commercially successful period of his career.his profile gained another boost from his appearance at the 1985 live aid famine relief concert at wembley stadium, where he was one of the standout performers. in addition, he teamed up with mick jagger to record the fundraising single dancing in the street, which sped to number 1.a few days after his appearance at the freddie mercury tribute concert at wembley stadium in april 1992, bowie married the somalian model iman and the couple bought a home in new york. this new start in his private life coincided with a search for fresh musical inspiration.for the album black tie white noise (1993), he sprinkled elements of soul, electronica and hip hop into the mix. it topped the uk album chart and yielded a top 10 single, jump they say.new media and technology influenced his recordings, too. his 1999 album hours… was based around music he had written for a computer game called omikron, in which bowie and iman appeared as characters. the birth of bowie and iman’s daughter, alexandria, followed in august 2000.as an adopted new yorker, bowie was the opening act at the concert for new york city in october 2001, where he joined paul mccartney, jon bon jovi, billy joel, the who and elton john in a benefit show six weeks after the 9/11 attacks.bowie was back in the studio the following year for reality. however, in the midst of his reality tour in 2004, bowie was stricken with chest pains while performing in germany and underwent emergency surgery in hamburg to clear a blocked artery.he took the medical emergency as a warning and reduced the pace of his activities. in 2006, he announced he would be taking a year off from touring and recording. in february that year, he was given a grammy lifetime achievement award, having been inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1996.the next day (2013) was his first album of new material in a decade. it contained the single where are we now?, which gave him his first uk top 10 hit since 1993. the

advanced	when you see the word amazon, what’s the first thing that springs to mind – the world’s biggest forest, the longest river or the largest internet retailer – and which do you consider most important?these questions have risen to the fore in an arcane, but hugely important, debate about how to redraw the boundaries of the internet. brazil and peru have lodged objections to a bid made by the us e-commerce giant for a prime new piece of cyberspace: “.amazon”.the seattle-based company has applied for its brand to be a top-level domain name (currently “.com”), but the south american governments argue this would prevent the use of this internet address for environmental protection, the promotion of indigenous rights and other public interest uses.along with dozens of other disputed claims to names, including “.patagonia” and “.shangrila”, the issue cuts to the heart of debates about the purpose and governance of the internet.until now, the differences between commercial, governmental and other types of identity were easily distinguished in every internet address by “.com”, “.gov” and 20 other categories.but these categories – or generic top-level domains (gtlds) as they are technically known – are about to undergo the biggest expansion since the start of the worldwide web.the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (icann) – a us-based non-profit organization that plays a key role in cyberspace governance – has received bids (each reportedly worth almost $200,000) for hundreds of new gtlds to add to the existing 22.amazon has applied for dozens of new domains, including “.shop”, “.song”, “.book” and “.kindle”. but its most contentious application is for its own brand.brazil and peru have called for the “.amazon” application to be withdrawn, saying a private company should not be assigned a name that denotes an important geographical area that spans their territories and is also used for certain regions and cross-border organizations.“allowing private companies to register geographical names as gtlds to reinforce their brand strategy or to profit from the meaning of these names does not serve, in our view, the public interest,” the brazilian ministry of science and technology said.brazil said its views were endorsed last month by other members of the amazon cooperation treaty (bolivia, colombia, ecuador, guyana, suriname and venezuela).dozens of other protests have also been registered over proposed top-level domains that take geographical, cultural or contested brand names.argentina has lodged an expression of its unhappiness that the us outdoor clothing retailer, patagonia, is claiming a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty that also has its own parliament. “argentina rejects the ‘.patagonia’ request for a new generic top-level domain,” the government notes in an appeal. “patagonia is a relevant region for the country’s economy because it has oil, fishing, mining and agriculture resources. it is also a region with a vibrant local community and it is a major tourist destination.”less convincingly, china has disputed the domain “.shangrila”, which is proposed by a hotel group of the same name. the authorities in beijing say the “shangri-la” label belongs to a region in yunnan province, although it was only renamed as such in 2001 (long after the hotel group was formed) so that the local community could cash in on the fame of the fictional paradise depicted in the novel, lost horizon, by british author james hilton.at a conference in april in beijing, icann’s governmental advisory committee – the primary voice of national governments within the institution – recommended a freeze on disputed proposals. they are expected to be discussed again at a meeting in durban in july. the first approved domain names should be in use before the end of 2013.

advanced	"the moroccan city of ouarzazate is used to big productions. on the edge of the sahara desert and at the centre of the north african countryõs òouallywoodó  lm industry, it has played host to big-budget location shots in lawrence of arabia, the mummy, the living daylights and even game of thrones.now, the trading city, nicknamed the òdoor of the desertó, is the location for another blockbuster ð a complex of four linked solar mega-plants, which, alongside hydro and wind, will help provide nearly half of moroccoõs electricity from renewables by 2020 with, it is hoped, some spare to export to europe. the project is a key plank in moroccoõs ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower.when the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world and the  rst phase, called noor 1, will go live in november 2015. the mirror technology it uses is less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that are now familiar on roofs the world over but it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down.the potential for solar power from the desert has been known for decades. in the days after the chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, the german particle physicist gerhard knies calculated that the worldõs deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to provide for humanityõs power needs for a whole year. the challenge, though, has been capturing that energy and transporting it to the population centres where it is required.as engineers put the  nishing touches to noor 1, its 500,000 crescent-shaped solar mirrors glitter across the desert skyline. the 800 rows follow the sun as it tracks across the heavens, whirring quietly every few minutes as their shadows slip further east.when they are  nished, the four plants at ouarzazate will occupy a space as big as moroccoõs capital city, rabat, and generate 580 mega-watts (mw) of electricity, enough to power a million homes. noor 1 itself has a generating capacity of 160mw.moroccoõs environment minister, hakima el-haite, believes that solar energy could have the same impact on the region this century that oil production had in the last. but the $9bn project to make her countryõs deserts boom was triggered by more immediate concerns, she said.òwe are not an oil producer. we import 94% of our energy as fossil fuels from abroad and that has big consequences for our state budget,ó el-haite told the guardian. òwe also used to subsidize fossil fuels, which have a heavy cost, so when we heard about the potential of solar energy, we thought, ôwhy not?õósolar energy will make up a third of moroccoõs renewable energy supply by 2020, with wind and hydro taking the same share each.òwe are very proud of this project,ó el-haite said. òi think it is the most important solar plant in the world.óeach parabolic mirror is 12 metres high and focused on a steel pipeline carrying a ôheat transfer solutionõ (htf) that is warmed to 393c as it snakes along the trough before coiling into a heat engine. there, it is mixed with water to create steam that turns energy- generating turbines.the htf is made up of a synthetic thermal oil solution that is pumped towards a heat tank containing molten sands that can store heat energy for three hours, allowing the plant to power homes into the night. the mirrors are spaced in tier formations to minimize damage from sand blown up by desert winds.technicians say that the noor 2 and 3 plants, due to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours ð opening the prospect of 24/7 solar energy in the sahara and the surrounding region.òthe biggest challenge we faced was being able to  nish the project on time with the performance level we needed to achieve,ó said rashid al-bayad, the project director.but, even as the  rst phase of the project nears completion, morocco is eyeing grander international ambitions. we are already involved in high tension transportation lines to cover the full south of morocco and mauritania as a  rst step, says ahmed baroudi, manager of societe dinvestissements energetiques, the national renewable energy investment  rm. but he says the projects ultimate impact will go far wider  even as far as the middle east. the ultimate objective given by his majesty the king is mecca."" whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the moroccan solar energy agency (masen). talks are ongoing with tunisia and energy exports northwards across the mediterranean remain a key goal.òwe believe that itõs possible to export energy to europe but,  rst, we would have to build the interconnectors which donõt yet exist,ó said maha el-kadiri, a masen spokeswoman. òspeci cally, we would have to build interconnections, which would not go through the existing one in spain, and, then, start exporting.óspain has itself prohibited new solar projects because of a lack of interconnectors to transmit the energy to france. the eu has set a target of ensuring that 10% of each member countryõs power can be transported abroad by cable by 2020.in the meantime, morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs for resource independence. this could, one day, include water desalination, in a country that is increasingly being hit by drought as the climate warms. of cials are keenly aware of the running they are making in what is the most advanced renewable energy programme in the middle east and north african region.òwe are at the avante-garde of solar,ó el-kadiri says.about $9bn has been invested in the noor complex, much of it from international institutions such as the european investment bank and world bank and backed by moroccan government guarantees. undisclosed energy subsidies from moroccoõs unelected ruler, king mohammed vi, have prevented the cost from being transferred to energy consumers.one month before launch, over a thousand, mostly moroccan, workers are still racing to  x electric wires, take down scaffolding and wrap rockwool insulation around steel pipelines. they bustle past in yellow and orange bibs, working 12-hour shifts against a backdrop of the atlas mountains. harnesses with hammers and gloves strapped to their belts swing by their sides. ubiquitous hard hats, safety shoes and ear plugs give the scene an air of theatrical camp.for hajar lakhael, a 25-year-old environment and security manager from meknes, rehearsals are almost over and the blockbuster production is nearly ready for action.òweõve done the construction and, now, we will see how these projects look when they start,ó she says. òit is exactly like the preparation for a grand performance.óa global audience will be watching with interest."

their love and support has been essential. my wife, cathy, has been the key figure throughout my career, providing a bedrock of both stability and encouragement. words are not enough to express what this has meant to me.“as for my players and staff, past and present, i would like to thank them all for a staggering level of professional conduct and dedication that has helped to deliver so many memorable triumphs. without their contribution, the history of this great club would not be as rich. in my early years, the backing of the board, and sir bobby charlton in particular, gave me the confidence and time to build a football club, rather than just a football team.“over the past decade, the glazer family have provided me with the platform to manage manchester united to the best of my ability and i have been extremely fortunate to have worked with a talented and trustworthy chief executive in david gill. i am truly grateful to all of them. to the fans, thank you. the support you have provided over the years has been truly humbling. it has been an honour and an enormous privilege to have had the opportunity to lead your club and i have treasured my time as manager of manchester united.”the sudden nature of ferguson’s departure is in keeping with how the scot stated he would leave the post after he mentioned a first retirement during the 2001/2 season before performing a u-turn. it is understood he gathered the players in the first-team changing room shortly after they arrived for training on wednesday morning. in an emotional speech, he announced he was to step down. he then took his backroom staff aside before finally addressing the rest of the staff in the canteen.joel glazer, joint owner of manchester united, said: “alex has proven time and time again what a fantastic manager he is but he’s also a wonderful person. his determination to succeed and dedication to the club have been truly remarkable. i will always cherish the wonderful memories he has given us, like that magical night in moscow.”avie glazer, his brother, said: “i am delighted to announce that alex has agreed to stay with the club as a director. his contributions to manchester united over the last 27 years have been extraordinary and, like all united fans, i want him to be a part of its future.”david gill, the outgoing chief executive, said: “i’ve had the tremendous pleasure of working very closely with alex for 16 unforgettable years – through the treble, the double, countless trophy wins and numerous signings. we knew that his retirement would come one day and we both have been planning for it by ensuring the quality of the squad and club structures are in first-class condition. alex’s vision, energy and ability have built teams – both on and off the pitch – that his successor can count on as among the best and most loyal in world sport.“the way he cares for this club, his staff and for the football family in general is something that i admire. it is a side to him that is often hidden from public view but it is something that i have been privileged to witness in the last 16 years. what he has done for this club and for the game in general will never be forgotten. it has been the greatest experience of my working life being alongside alex and a great honour to be able to call him a friend.”first-team coach rené meulensteen revealed how ferguson broke the news to his backroom staff on wednesday morning. “i found out this morning when i came to the club,” he said. “he called us into his office and told us what decision he had taken. it’s always been on the cards – there’s speculation every season. i think the manager kept his cards close to his chest. i think he felt the time was right now and he made a decision.“he’s obviously a man who thinks very, very hard so i’m sure he’s put a lot of thought into making this decision. i wish him well. he’s been fantastic for this club and i hope all the fans give whoever’s going to come in the same support that he gets.”
advanced	prince harry has flown out of afghanistan at the end of a four-month tour, during which he admitted killing insurgents while piloting his apache helicopter and spoke in rare depth about the tensions and frustrations of being a royal who craved life out of the spotlight.he also revealed his disdain for and distrust of some sections of the media and described how his father constantly reminded him to behave more like a member of the royal family.a commander of the army’s most sophisticated attack helicopter, the prince said he had fired on the taliban during operations to support ground troops and rescue injured afghan and nato personnel. his remarks may be seized upon by insurgents to stir anti-british sentiment, but the prince said he was only doing his job. most of the time the helicopter acted more as a deterrent, he said.in a series of interviews during his time based at camp bastion in helmand province, he hinted at the difficulty of reconciling the different roles in his life. the prince, known as captain wales in the army, explained his ‘three mes’. “one in the army, one socially in my own private time and then one with the family and stuff like that. so there is a switch and i flick it when necessary.”he admitted he sometimes ‘let himself down’ with his laddish behaviour, which he put down to “probably being too much army and not enough prince”, but he said he was entitled to privacy, too.in another unusually frank exchange, he aimed biting criticism at the media, especially the sun, the daily mail and the daily telegraph, three of the royal family’s most ardent supporters in fleet street. he said he was particularly annoyed by articles comparing his role as an apache co-pilot gunner to spitfire crews waiting to scramble during the second world war. “no, it’s not like that at all,” he said.the prince said his suspicion of the media was rooted in the treatment of his family when “i was very small”, but that he couldn’t help monitoring the stories written about him. “of course i read them,” the prince said. “if there’s a story and something’s been written about me, i want to know what’s being said. but all it does is just upset me and anger me that people can get away with writing the stuff they do; not just about me, but about everything and everybody. my father always says, ‘don’t read it’. everyone says, ‘don’t read it, because it’s always rubbish’.”the prince was posted to afghanistan last september to command a £45m apache helicopter – one of the military’s most sophisticated and well-armed aircraft. during his tour, the apaches flew missions supporting nato troops fighting the taliban and accompanied british chinook and us black hawk medical helicopters during casualty evacuations.four years ago, the prince had to be spirited out of afghanistan during his first tour after a media embargo was broken by mistake by an australian magazine. this time, the ministry of defence chose to publicize his deployment on the understanding that newspapers and broadcasters would not give a running commentary on his life out there to allow him to get on with his job. two-man crews from the bbc, sky and itn were sent once each to report on his visit, while a photographer and a reporter from the press association were embedded on all three visits.asked whether he felt more comfortable being captain wales than prince harry, his reply was one of the most revealing he has given about his relationship with prince charles. “definitely. i’ve always been like that. my father’s always trying to remind me about who i am and stuff like that. but it’s very easy to forget about who i am when i am in the army. everyone’s wearing the same uniform and doing the same kind of thing. i get on well with the lads and i enjoy my job. it really is as simple as that.”shortly before he went to afghanistan, the prince was caught in another media furore, when pictures emerged of him frolicking naked in las vegas during a private party. harry said he had let himself down, but also blamed the media. “i probably let myself down, i let my family down, i let other people down. but, at the end of the day, i was in a private area and there should be a certain amount of privacy that one should expect. it was probably a classic example of me probably being too much army, and not enough prince. it’s a simple case of that.“the papers knew that i was going out to afghanistan anyway, so the way i was treated from them i don’t think is acceptable.” he added, “certain people remind me, ‘remember who you are, so don’t always drop your guard’.”asked where he and his brother’s fascination with helicopters came from, he said, “probably the fact that you can only fit a certain amount of people in a helicopter, therefore no one can follow us, like you guys.”
