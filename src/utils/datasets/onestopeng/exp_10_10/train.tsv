intermediate	the huge fortunes made by the world’s richest 100 billionaires are increasing inequality and hindering the world’s ability to tackle poverty, according to oxfam.the charity said the accumulation of wealth and income often led to a reduction in secure jobs and decent wages for the poorest people. this made it more difficult for people who survive on aid or low wages to improve their situation and escape poverty.oxfam said the world’s poorest could be taken out of poverty several times over if the richest 100 billionaires would give away the money they made in 2012.without naming anyone, the charity argued that the $240bn made in 2012 by the richest 100 billionaires would be enough to end extreme poverty four times over.it is unusual for charities to attack the wealthy, because they are usually seen as a source of money. bill gates and warren buffett are among a group of 40 us billionaires who have said they will give much of their wealth to aid projects, but there is little detail about the level of their annual donations. russian, middle eastern or chinese billionaires have not promised to do the same.in the report, the cost of inequality: how wealth and income extremes hurt us all, published just before the world economic forum in davos, the charity asks world leaders to commit to reducing inequality to at least 1990 levels.the report found that the richest 1% had increased their incomes by 60% in the past 20 years. and the financial crisis has sped up, not slowed, the process.barbara stocking, oxfam’s chief executive, said studies show that countries suffer low levels of investment and growth as workers are forced to survive on a smaller share of total incomes.she said: “we can no longer pretend that the creation of wealth for a few will benefit the many – too often the reverse is true.”the report said the issue affected all parts of the world. “in the uk, inequality is rapidly returning to levels not seen since the nineteenth century. in china, the top 10% now earn nearly 60% of the income. chinese inequality levels are now similar to those in south africa, which is now the most unequal country on earth.”in the us, the share of national income going to the top 1% has doubled since 1980 from 10 to 20%, the report says.members of the richest 1% are estimated to cause as much as 10,000 times more pollution than the average us citizen.oxfam said world leaders should learn from countries such as brazil, which has grown rapidly while reducing inequality.stocking said: “we need to reverse decades of increasing inequality. as a first step, world leaders should formally agree to reduce inequality to the levels seen in 1990.”she said closing tax havens, which hold as much as $31 trillion, or as much as a third of all global wealth, could collect $189bn in additional taxes.nannan
intermediate	well-known british author david mitchell is used to the critics analysing his novels in detail. so, it’s a relief, he says, that his latest work won’t be seen by anyone until 2114. he completed it at 1am one tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to norway.mitchell is the second contributor to the scottish artist katie paterson’s future library project, for which 1,000 trees were planted in 2014 in oslo’s nordmarka forest. the first author, margaret atwood, handed over the manuscript of a text called scribbler moon in 2015. each year for the next 100 years, an author will deliver a piece of writing that will only be read in 2114, when the trees are chopped down to make paper on which the 100 texts will be printed.each author – their names revealed year by year and chosen by a panel of experts and paterson, while she is alive – will travel to the spot in the forest high above oslo, where they will hand over their manuscripts in a short ceremony.“it’s a little glimmer of hope in a season when there has been lots of very depressing news, which shows that we are in with a chance of civilization in a hundred years,” said mitchell. “everything is telling us that we’re doomed but the future library brings hope that we are more resilient than we think: that we will be here, that there will be trees, that there will be books and readers, and civilization.”mitchell said he found writing the book “quite liberating because i won’t be around to take the consequences of this being good or bad. but, i’m sandwiched between margaret atwood and no doubt some other brilliant writer. so, it had better be good. i’d look such a fool if they opened it in 2114 and it wasn’t any good.”mitchell says that he usually “polishes and polishes” his writing. “actually, i over-polish. but, this was very different – i wrote till the final minute. so, the first two-thirds were polished and the final third i didn’t have time. and, it was a liberation.”future library creator, paterson, asked the writers to write on “the theme of imagination and time, which they can take in so many directions”. mitchell revealed only the name of the manuscript, from me flows what you call time, during a ceremony in the norwegian woods next to where paterson’s 1,000 trees are planted. the title is taken from a piece of music by japanese composer toru takemitsu. but, other than admitting that “it’s more substantial than i was expecting”, the author would say nothing more.handing over his text in the forest, mitchell read his audience of children and adults a short story and william wordsworth’s a slumber did my spirit seal. its ending, “rolled round in earth’s diurnal course / with rocks, and stones, and trees”, felt appropriate in this small section of forest, which will be carefully tended to for the next 98 years before it is turned into future library’s manuscripts.“how vain to think that my scribblings will be of enduring interest to future generations. yet, how low-key and understated, to slave over a manuscript that nobody will ever congratulate you for and say: ‘nice one’ or ‘god, i loved the bit where she did that and he did this ...’” mitchell wrote in a piece for the future library.his manuscript, now delivered, will be sealed and placed alongside atwood’s in a wood-lined room in oslo’s new public library, which will open in 2019. watched over by a panel of experts until it is finally printed, it is now, says the novelist, “as gone from me as a coin dropped in a river”.
intermediate	when it comes to climate change, we usually just focus on the  rst part of the story, the part about the problem. we usually forget the second part of the story about the many available solutions. these solutions are speeding up recycling, slowing down emissions and providing sustainable alternatives to plastic, air conditioning, smartphones and fast fashion.the intergovernmental panel on climate change met recently in copenhagen to present its latest report on the impacts and speed of climate change. climate change is now measured on all continents. our efforts to lower emissions must be intensi ed to avoid climate change getting out of control. copenhagen looked at the risks and challenges but also the solutions.focusing on what can be done, sustainia award, chaired by arnold schwarzenegger, celebrated ten leading sustainable solutions used in 84 countries. from food to fashion, energy to transportation, education to health, the awards showed that there is an alternative to the grim-future scenarios we so often read about.from california, we saw how we can now produce plastics from greenhouse gases that are competitive with normal oil-based plastics in price and quality. from switzerland, we learned how we can recycle and reuse old clothes and shoes more effectively. and from canada, we learned how smartphones can make bike-sharing more convenient.the ten projects each offered unique solutions to sustainability challenges but it was the nigerian initiative, wecyclers, that won arnold schwarzenegger and the rest of juryõs vote. it won the sustainia award 2014.wecyclers allows poor communities to make money on waste in their streets. by using bicycles to collect and recycle waste in lagos, wecyclers lets families exchange garbage for consumer goods via an sms-based point system.recycling companies purchase wecyclersõ sorted waste and make it into products such as mattresses, pillows and trash bags. wecyclers is a response to local waste problems, where itõs estimated that only 40% of the cityõs rubbish is collected. according to the world bank, only 46% of municipal waste in africa is collected. more than 5,000 households are involved and there are plans to extend the initiative to other cities throughout nigeria.solutions to deal with climate change are often hi-tech innovations focused on cutting emissions. however, to successfully solve the variety of challenges, we need variety in our solutions as well. sustainability is not just about bringing down emissions, it is also a question of using our natural resources more intelligently and creating healthier lives for ourselves. these initiatives might be low-tech in innovation, but they are high-impact when it comes to creating sustainable change for entire communities.with a wide range of solutions for the wide range of challenges, we must focus more on the important part of the story that creates enthusiasm, momentum and that helps to create positive change.
intermediate	for 85 years, it was just a grey blob on classroom maps of the solar system. but, on 15 july, pluto was seen in high resolution for the first time. the images show dramatic mountain ranges made from solid water ice as big as the alps or the rockies.the extraordinary images of the former ninth planet and its large moon, charon, were sent back 4bn miles to earth from the new horizons spacecraft. they are the climax of a mission that has been quietly underway for nearly ten years.alan stern, the mission’s principal investigator, said “new horizons is returning amazing results. the data look absolutely gorgeous, and pluto and charon are just mind-blowing.”one of the biggest surprises was the discovery that “there are mountains in the kuiper belt”, the solar system’s mysterious “third zone” where pluto is, with about 100,000 smaller icy objects. john spencer, a mission scientist, said the mountains appear to be around 3,000 metres high and several hundred miles across.the detailed image of one edge of the dwarf planet showed not a single crater. this tells scientists that there has been recent geological activity on the surface, which could include dramatic geysers throwing ice into the atmosphere or cryo-volcanoes that erupt in explosions of ice.pluto used to be the ninth planet but, since 2006, it has been known as a dwarf planet. the nasa press conference began with spectacular images of the sun and the eight official planets. “we’ve brought what was previously a blurred point of light into focus,” said dwayne brown, nasa spokesman, as scientists and journalists waited for the image to be shown.stern said that there would be many more images and that we would learn a lot more about the planet during the coming year. the images have already produced some surprises. scientists believe the mountains are made from water ice with just a thin cover of “exotic” ices, methane and nitrogen.“water ice is strong enough to hold up big mountains and that’s what we think we can see here. this is the first time we’ve seen this. the methane and nitrogen are just a coating.” the mountains on pluto probably formed no more than 100m years ago – extremely recently in the 4.56bn-year-old solar system. this suggests the region, which covers about 1% of pluto’s surface, may still be geologically active. the images are the first to show ice mountains, except those found on the moons of giant planets.the images are so detailed that, if the craft were flying over london, we would be able to see the runways at heathrow airport.the distance to pluto – 5bn km – means it takes new horizons hours to send back a picture and it will take 16 months to send back all the data. the team also announced that the heart-shaped feature visible on pluto will now be known as the tombaugh regio, after clyde tombaugh, who discovered the dwarf planet in 1930.the new view of charon reveals an area of cliffs stretching about 1,000km. this suggests cracks in charon’s surface, which could also be the result of geological activity. the image also shows a dramatic canyon about 7 to 9km deep.cathy olkin, a mission scientist, said: “charon just blew our socks off when we saw the new image today. the team has just been abuzz. there is so much interesting science in this one image alone.” scientists think that pluto is two thirds rock surrounded by a lot of ice, with surface temperatures of about minus 230c. as the £460m mission continues into the kuiper belt, scientists hope that it will help us to see and understand more of the ancient solar system and the origins of planets. it may even help to explain the formation of the earth itself.andrew coates, head of planetary science at the mullard space science laboratory, said: “these kuiper belt objects are the building blocks of the outer solar system. they’re all very cold – it’s like a cosmic deep freeze. it’s the best way of preserving solar system history. that is what is so fascinating about this. it’s a really thrilling time for solar system exploration.”in august 2015, mission scientists will choose which of two objects to visit next. nasa estimates that the spacecraft will be able to keep recording and sending back data until the mid-2030s. then, its plutonium power source will run out and it will drift outwards towards the edge of the solar system and deep space.new horizons also observed the smaller members of the pluto system, which includes four other moons: nix, hydra, styx and kerberos. “new horizons is a true mission of exploration, showing us why basic scientific research is so important,” said john grunsfeld, associate administrator for nasa’s science mission directorate.the images also suggest that hydra’s surface is probably coated with water ice. future images will reveal more clues about the formation of this, and the other moon, billions of years ago.”nan
intermediate	there comes a time in some men’s lives when the days seem darker, death more certain, and the only sensible response is to blow the life savings on a sportscar.radical and often ill-advised changes in lifestyle are typical for the midlife crisis but, if it is more than a myth, then humans may not be the only animals to experience it.now an international team of scientists claims it has found evidence for a slump in well-being among middle-aged chimpanzees and orangutans. the lull in happiness in the middle years, they say, is the ape equivalent of the midlife crisis.the findings of the study, which was published in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences, suggest that the midlife crisis may have its roots in the biology humans share with our closest evolutionary cousins.“there’s a common understanding that there’s a dip in well-being in middle age,” alex weiss, a psychologist at edinburgh university, told the guardian.he said that they took a step back and asked whether it’s possible that the midlife crisis is not just something human.the team from the us, japan, germany and the uk asked zookeepers and others who worked with male and female apes of various ages to complete questionnaires on the animals.the forms included questions about each ape’s mood, the enjoyment they got from socializing, and their success at achieving certain goals. the final question asked how zookeepers would feel about being the ape for a week. they scored their answers from one to seven.more than 500 apes were included in the study in three separate groups. the first two groups were chimpanzees, with the third made up of orangutans from sumatra or borneo. the animals came from zoos, sanctuaries and research centres in the us, australia, japan, canada and singapore.when the researchers analyzed the questionnaires, they found that well-being in the apes fell in middle age and climbed again as the animals moved into old age. in captivity, great apes often live to 50 or more. the animals’ well-being was at its lowest, on average, at 28.3 and 27.2 years old for the chimpanzees, and 35.4 years old for the orangutans.“in all three groups we find evidence that well-being is lowest in chimpanzees and orangutans at an age that corresponds more or less to midlife in humans,” weiss said. “on average, well-being scores are lowest when animals are around 30 years old.”robin dunbar, professor of evolutionary psychology at oxford university, was sceptical about the findings. “what can produce a sense of well-being that varies across their lifetimes like this? it’s hard to see anything in an ape’s life that would have that sort of pattern. they’re not particularly good at seeing far ahead into the future; that’s one of the big differences between them and us.”alexandra freund, professor of psychology at the university of zurich, was also sceptical. she said, “in my opinion, there is no evidence for the midlife crisis.”but weiss believes the findings could point to a deeper understanding of the emotional crisis some men may experience. “if we want to find the answer to the question of what’s going on with the midlife crisis, we should look at what is similar in middle-aged humans, chimps and orangutans,” he said.nannan
intermediate	on the top of a hill, looking down on northumberland’s beautiful kielder water reservoir, a group of people wait in a car park next to a strange wooden building. they are looking for darkness and this is kielder observatory, the centre of britain’s latest industry – astrotourism. the people waiting outside are the lucky ones. many more apply for a night of stargazing at the observatory but numbers are strictly limited.inside, under a dim light, the observatory’s founder and lead astronomer, gary fildes, delivers a speech to his colleagues and volunteers. the team discusses the prospect of seeing the northern lights but fildes is doubtful. instead, they decide to use their powerful telescopes to observe jupiter and venus and, later, to pick out stars such as capella and betelgeuse. an additional attraction is the appearance of the international space station.fildes, 49, is at the forefront of the uk’s growing astrotourism industry. the key moment for northumberland came in 2013 when the entire national park, about 1,500 square kilometres in area, was awarded dark sky park status, the only one in england. dark sky parks are rare. the 2013 star count revealed that only 5% of the uk population can see more than 31 stars on a clear night.the arizona-based international dark-sky association (ida) awards the status of dark sky park only to places that take major steps to avoid light pollution. and those areas must also prove their night skies are dark enough. in northumberland dark sky park, as the area was renamed, it is so dark that venus casts a shadow on the earth.duncan wise, visitor development officer for the northumberland national park authority, helped to lead the campaign for dark-sky status. “we tend to look at landscape as everything up to the horizon,” wise said. “but what about what’s above it?” wise and others spent years preparing their application to the ida, collecting thousands of light readings and producing an exterior lighting master plan that influences the construction of new developments in the area.their efforts have been rewarded. many of the 1.5 million who visit northumberland each year are now aware of its dark sky status. “we get a lot of people coming here to see the sky now,” says the man at the car-hire firm in newcastle. “they come in autumn and winter, when it’s darkest. it’s good for the local hotels because they get business all year round now.” local hotels now give guests night-vision torches and put out deckchairs at night.wise agrees that northumberland needs to do more to take advantage of its scarce resource. he believes the region needs a couple more observatories to ensure that visitors will see what they came for. a new £14m national landscape discovery centre will have an observatory when it is completed in a couple of years.fildes has big ambitions. he is planning britain’s first “astrovillage”, one that would contain the largest public observatory in the world and have a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, a one-metre aperture telescope, and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes. the multimillion-pound project would also have a hotel and draw in 100,000 people a year, four times the number currently able to use the observatory. fildes believes the astrovillage will be a reality by 2018.however, northumberland has competition. galloway forest park in scotland also has dark sky park status. since exmoor was designated europe’s first international dark sky reserve – one level below dark sky park – in 2011, a range of local businesses offering stargazing breaks and safaris has sprung up. the uk has a long way to go to rival northern chile, which has more than a dozen tourist observatories and some of the clearest skies in the world. the teide national park in tenerife is also becoming a major astrotourism destination.so, why do people want to look up into the night sky? the media have helped. tv presenters like brian cox have attracted a new generation of stargazers. “brian cox has made astronomy accessible,” says wise. “it’s no longer seen as something just for professors with telescopes.” technology has also made astronomy more popular. apps such as stellarium now turn smartphones into pocket-size planetariums. but fildes believes that, most importantly, people are starting to appreciate what lies above. “if you had to build a visitor attraction from scratch, what could be better than the universe?”nan
intermediate	in 2010, the police would only enter the old city in srinagar wearing body armour. it was at the centre of uprisings by violent separatists, who were fighting for an independent kashmir. more than 100 people died.how quickly things change. the same streets are now full of tourists. the nowhatta mosque is where young people would meet to throw stones at the security forces. now the mosque will be part of an official walking tour focused on heritage, crafts and markets. visitors can have their picture taken in the beautiful gardens by the lake. until the snow melted, the ski resorts nearby were packed with rich russians, too.in 2002, only just over 27,000 tourists dared to visit the kashmir valley. people were frightened by the anti-indian insurgency, in which almost 70,000 people have died. so far in 2012, the area has received almost one million tourists – more than 23,000 of them from outside india. but there were fewer than 150 britons – mainly because the uk’s foreign office advice deters most travellers by giving a list of recent security problems in the region.omar abdullah, the uk-born chief minister of jammu and kashmir, has asked the british high commission in delhi to change its guidelines, but without success. “it’s frustrating,” admitted abdullah, who has been in charge of india’s most sensitive state since early 2009. “today, unfortunately, as a result of that travel advice, people’s insurance isn’t valid when they visit here.” 1995 was the last time foreign tourists were murdered in j&k. six westerners, including two britons, were kidnapped by al-faran, a kashmiri militant islamist group. only one survived.“british citizens have been killed more recently in countries that you still haven’t stopped people from visiting. i mean, how many british citizens did you lose in 9/11? did you stop people from visiting new york? you’ve lost them in spain, in bali,” said abdullah. “we’ve lost indians in london. there is still a possibility that al-qaida could do something stupid, but we haven’t stopped indians from travelling to london. there is no reason to say jammu and kashmir, or even srinagar, is an unsafe destination.”germany relaxed its guidelines for travellers to the region in 2011. “foreigners are usually not direct targets,” said germany’s amended advice. at the time, many thought it was a bold thing to say, less than a year after the 2010 disturbances finally calmed down. there was a national holiday on 15 august to celebrate 65 years of indian independence – in the past, a day fraught with danger in a state where many do not feel part of india. but there was no trouble at the independence celebrations.abdullah is confident that tourists are safe in the state, “if you take the normal sort of precautions”. in other words, do not go trekking near the border that separates the indian and pakistani controlled parts of kasmir. syed ali shah geelani, leader of the pro-kashmiri independence party, disagrees with abdullah’s politics. but the two men agree about tourism. at the start of the summer season, geelani wrote an open letter to tourists that said: “whatever your faith, whatever language you speak and to whatever region you belong … you are our honoured guest, and respecting and protecting guests is not only our moral obligation but an article of faith.”some visitors may worry about the ethics of having fun in a place where the local people are suffering from record levels of anxiety and mental health problems. but the locals in srinagar seem to be in favour of tourism. amjid gulzar, 26, said abdullah could search for truth and reconciliation as well as encouraging foreign visitors. “he must do both; but without tourism, our economy will be in chaos,” he said.“we need better infrastructure, better roads, reliable electricity. we need more for tourists to do in the evening – we don’t even have one cinema in this city,” he said. but will tourists feel welcome? in june, a local islamic group created a “dress code” for foreign tourists. abdullah sighs when i mention this. “nobody wants tourists to come here and cover their faces. i think their basic point was: be sensitive to our cultural identity and dress appropriately. i think that’s common sense.”abdullah said tourism would help the economy. j&k’s economy is in a dire state after more than two decades of conflict. the state receives just £72 million each year in taxes but £155 million is paid in salaries to 500,000 public employees. it is clear why he needs to find more money, fast. but, at the moment, he is just pleased to see tourists back.“i’m not suggesting that one million tourists here is a sign that everything is back to normal,” he said. “but it gives me some satisfaction that people can come, have a nice time, and go back.”
intermediate	to a traditional navigator like tua pittman from raratonga in the cook islands, a canoe is much more than just a means of transport. òthe canoe is our island, the crew members are the community and the navigator is the leader,ó pittman says. he continues, òon a canoe, you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds. navigation is using the philosophies of being a leader to show your crew members the light of life.óit has been a busy week for the crews of four sailing canoes since arriving in sydney for the start of the world parks congress. tuaõs journey began at the cook islands on 25 september. the islanders sailed to samoa, then fiji, vanuatu and onto the gold coast, before sailing south to sydney. around 100 crew members were involved in the voyage and they aimed to travel using only traditional navigation techniques. unfortunately, said tua, the crews had to rely on modern navigation equipment at times to reach australia in time for the congress.the of cial title of the expedition is the mua voyage. it is a partnership between the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) oceania regional of ce and  ve paci c island countries: samoa, tonga, new zealand, the cook islands and fiji. the main goal of the 6,000-nautical-mile (11,000km) trip was to deliver a special message to the world parks congress.the message said: òwe see the signs of overexploitation. we no longer see the  sh and other marine creatures in the size, diversity or abundance of the past. we witness the change as foreign  shing  eets take our resources. our coral reefs, the greatest in the world and our spawning grounds are disappearing. our ocean is vast but not limitless. growing global populations and unsustainable development are reducing the ability of our ocean to sustain life.óthe paci c islanders have put a lot of effort into their urgent message to the delegates of the congress. but, despite this, the congress has spent much of its time trying to set a revised target for the amount of the ocean that needs to be protected in marine sanctuaries. according to the iucn, in 2013, the amount of the worldõs oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is ôno takeõ (no  shing). this was despite a target of 20-30% no-take areas set by the last world parks congress in 2003.marine scientist professor callum roberts was one of the scientists who helped set the 20-30% target in 2003. but he said it was not enough. òthe iucn should now lift its target from 30 to 33%. new research shows that we need to raise the 30% target. any reduction in efforts at this stage and moment in history would be disastrous for our oceans.óafter dif cult negotiations, the world parks congress delegates passed a motion that will dramatically change the goals for global marine management. instead of the 20-30% target, the iucn now says that each marine habitat should include strictly protected areas of at least 30%. these areas should address both biodiversity and ecosystem services.tua pittman was delighted with the news that a strong resolution on the planetõs oceans had passed the congress. òitõs a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here and to be heard. to hear they made that resolution is fantastic. itõs a step in the right direction.óhe said he was 55 and, in his lifetime, he was already beginning to see that it was much harder to catch  sh on the open ocean. he also said that pollution was getting worse, particularly as the canoes approached big cities such as sydney. and climate change is already beginning to have a serious effect on paci c islanders. òthe decisions of the big countries impact on the small countries twice, three times, four times more than they impact on developed, large nations.óthe mua voyage had been a massive logistical undertaking, said tua. years of preparation and navigational planning went into such a trip and it was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and acted. he said that the leaders of wealthy countries need to start to think more like traditional navigators who recognize that their boats are just specks in an enormous sea. most importantly, and spoken like a true navigator, tua says politicians must seek a different route. òthe world needs to  nd a different path.ó
intermediate	tea, baked beans on toast and fish and chips have long been part of the british food tradition. but, there has been a change in tastes over the generations. this has been clearly shown in data published recently in the national food survey, which was set up in 1940 by the government because of concerns about health and access to food.everyone knows the british love tea but consumption has more than halved since the 1970s, falling from 68g of tea per person per week to only 25g. britons are now drinking on average only eight cups of tea a week, down from 23 cups in 1974. and, while tea remains the most popular hot drink in the uk, people now spend more money on coffee.the data is from 150,000 households who took part in the survey between 1974 and 2000, combined with information from 2000 to 2014. it shows a move towards healthier diets in recent decades, with shifts to low-calorie soft drinks, from whole to skimmed milk and increasing consumption of fresh fruit. but, weekly consumption of chips, pizza, crisps and ready meals has soared.there has also been a dramatic shift from white to brown bread but the figures suggest the amount of bread people are eating has fallen from 25 to 15 slices a week over the past four decades. the consumption of baked beans has dropped by a fifth despite a rise in other types of convenience food, particularly italian dishes. adults in the uk now eat an average of 75g of pizza every week compared with none in 1974, while the consumption of pasta has almost tripled over the same period.fresh potatoes are also becoming less essential with a 67% decrease from 1974, when adults ate the equivalent of 188g every day. sales of other vegetables such as cucumbers, courgettes, aubergines and mushrooms have increased. consumption of takeaway food has almost doubled since 1974, from 80g per person per week to 150g. around 33g of this amount is chips and 56g is meat, with kebabs (10g), chicken (7g), burgers (5g) and “meat-based meals” (32g) particularly popular.some trends suggest that british people are becoming more careful about what they put on their plates, with the average consumption of fruit increasing by 50% since 1974. in 2014, uk adults ate an average of 157g of fruit per day. bananas have been the most popular fruit in the uk since 1996, reaching 221g per adult per week in 2014, well above apples (131g) and oranges (48g). lowcalorie soft drinks represented half of all soft drinks consumed in 2014 for the first time. britons are also spending a smaller proportion of their salaries on food today – 11%, compared with 24% in 1974.the uk environment secretary, elizabeth truss, said: “food is the heart of our society and this data not only shows what we were eating 40 years ago but how a change in culture has led to a food revolution. shoppers care more about where their food comes from than ever before, the internet has brought quality food to our doors at the click of a button, fashionable restaurants are showcasing the latest trends and exciting global cuisines are now as common as fish and chips.”“by studying this data, we can look beyond what, where or how previous generations were eating and pinpoint the moments that changed our habits forever. we’ve only scratched the surface of what the national food survey can tell us. from local food maps and school projects to predicting new food trends, i look forward to seeing how this data can be used to learn more about our past and grow our world-leading food and farming industry in the future.”nan
intermediate	pope benedict xvi arrived in 2005 as “a simple, humble worker in god’s vineyard”. and on a grey, cold, windy monday in february, he resigned in the same way: like an elderly labourer who can no longer ignore the pains in his back; who can no longer rely on the strength of his arms. a traditional pope, he made his excuses in latin. the first german pope in modern times gave an exact departure time. “from 28 february 2013, at 20.00 hours”, he told a group of cardinals in the vatican, “the see of rome, the see of saint peter, will be vacant and a new pope will have to be elected.”among those present was a mexican cardinal, monsignor oscar sanchéz barba, from guadalajara. he was in rome for an official meeting. “we were all in the sala del concistoro … of the apostolic palace,” he said. “the pope took a sheet of paper and read from it.“we were all left …” – sanchéz barba looked around him in st peter’s square, looking for the word; he was as speechless as the “princes of the church” who had just heard the man they believe to be god’s representative on earth give up the job. “the cardinals were just looking at one another,” sanchéz barba said.angelo sodano, the dean of the college of cardinals, who must have known beforehand, gave a brief speech. before going on to assure the pope of the cardinals’ loyalty and devotion, he said he and the others present had “listened to you with a sense of confusion, almost completely incredulous”. at the end of his speech, the pope blessed the people present, and left. “it was so simple; the simplest thing imaginable,” said sanchéz barba. “then we all left in silence. there was absolute silence … and sadness.”john thavis, who spent 30 years reporting on the vatican and whose book, the vatican diaries, is soon to be published, said he had had a feeling the pope might be about to resign and timed his return to rome from the us accordingly. thavis noted that in the long interview benedict gave to a german journalist in 2010, he had made it clear he considered it would be right to go if he felt he could no longer do the job. “i asked myself: if i were pope and wanted to resign, when would i choose? he has completed his series of books and most of his projects. what is more, there were no dates in his calendar of events he personally had to attend. i thought the most likely date was 22 february but i got it wrong.”within hours of the announcement, vatican officials were saying that the pope’s decision was a brave one. thavis agreed: “what i find particularly courageous is that he is prepared to say now, when he is not sick, that he is going; and that he’s doing it because he’s tired and not because he’s particularly ill.” but is that the whole story? does he know more about his state of health than the vatican has so far made public?benedict’s own reasons make it clear that he took into account not only his physical, but also his psychological condition. he said that the position of pope required both strength of mind and strength of body, and in the last few months he felt that strength was gradually decreasing. there will no doubt be other theories in the days and weeks ahead, just as there were following the death of pope john paul i in 1978, 33 days after his election. already there is speculation that some information was about to come out about benedict’s past. the vatican will no doubt dismiss any such stories. but they are understandable, for the transcendental importance of what benedict has done cannot be overstated.coming out of st peter’s basilica, julia rochester, from london, who described herself as a lapsed catholic, was still considering the implications of the pope’s resignation. “if you’re god’s chosen one, how do you choose not be chosen?” she asked. it is a question many catholics will be asking their priests in the weeks ahead.

elementary	the greek island of agios efstratios is very remote. it has been forgotten by the banks, the government and most of the modern world. it doesnõt have a single atm or credit-card machine. before the economic crisis in greece, the people of this peaceful island in the northern aegean lived quite well. the few rooms to rent were fully booked every summer with people enjoying its empty beaches, clear seas and fresh seafood.but the island still uses only cash so the closure of the greek banks has had a serious effect. local people have to make nine-hour round trips to the nearest big island to get cash. greek visitors say they donõt have enough cash to come. òtourist numbers have reduced by 80% this year,ó said mayor maria kakali, in an of ce in the village where she grew up. the village has about 200 people. òeven people born here and living in athens, who have their own places on the island, arenõt coming.ókakali has asked the government and a major greek bank to install an atm and this should arrive soon. but tourism is the main business on the island and she feels the atm may come too late for this season. òwe have almost no reservations in august, when usually we are full.ó but there is an even bigger crisis ahead ð the government has said it will end a tax break for islands.the tax break was created to help people on islands survive when lots of people were emigrating. islands that are popular with tourists, such as mykonos, fear that losing the tax break will make things very hard for them. but, for agios efstratios, it is a much bigger problem. òif we have to pay a tax of 23%, we will all die on the island,ó says kakali.food and fuel are already more expensive than on mainland greece. even in summer, the island has only three shops, two restaurants and not one of cial hotel. òthis is an expensive island. everything, even milk or bread, takes a long time to reach us and so is very expensive,ó said provatas costas, a 58-year-old  sherman.things are also dif cult for the island of lemnos, the closest large neighbour of agios efstratios. people saw the islands as remote for years partly because the only way to get there was by slow and unreliable ferries. in 2015, they  nally had new, ef cient ferries and this brought many new visitors to explore these islands. but, then, the bank controls began. òit started as the best season in 30 years and, in one week, it became the worst,ó said atzamis konstantinos, a travel agent in lemnos.lemnos has wild beaches, where you can swim and sunbathe almost alone, a small nightlife scene and many cultural sites. it is the eighth largest island in greece so it will have to pay the tax increases in autumn 2015. but lemnos is far less wealthy than many smaller islands. it has just over 3,000 beds for visitors ð rhodes, for example, has tens of thousands of beds. òwe have been suffering economically in recent years and now we will suffer more,ó said lemnos mayor, dimitris marinakis.if taxes go up, more young people will leave, warns mayor kakali. because it is one of the smallest islands, agios efstratios will not have to pay the tax increase until 2017. and kakali hopes the situation in greece will change before then. but, if not, she plans to travel to athens to remind the distant government what the tax rise would cost.òthe government doesnõt pay much attention to the islands of the north aegean,ó she said, òso i would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament, to tell them: ôthere is still life in these islandsõ.ó nannan

elementary	thousands of people protested on australiaõs beaches against a shark cull in western australia. they asked the stateõs prime minister to stop the cull, and rspca australia and virgin atlantic owner richard branson criticized it. catching and killing sharks longer than three metres began after a number of shark attacks on western australiaõs coast. a 35-year-old surfer, who was killed in november 2013, was the sixth person to die from a shark attack in two years.but the whole of australia has had, on average, just one shark-related death a year for the last 50 years. kate faehrmann, of the sea shepherd conservation society, said, from a protest in perth, the state capital of western australia: òweõve always said that this idea wonõt work. drumlines, which they use to catch the sharks, kill sharks if theyõre one, two, three metres or more, and also dolphins, turtles and other things. thatõs why we donõt want the cull.óthousands of people protested on beaches in the cities of perth, sydney and adelaide, and at beaches in victoria and queensland. faehrmann said the protests showed that australians wanted sharks to be protected: òwhatõs amazing is that so many people in australia love sharks. this has shown that people are scared but thousands of people are coming out across the country to say, ôthatõs the sharksõ ocean. we respect them, we love them and we donõt want you to kill them.õ anthony joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharkõs mouth, said: òthe number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference.óthe state government will not say how many sharks they have killed, but some people say that sharks smaller than three metres were released after they were caught on drumlines,  oating drums  xed to the sea bed with bait on hooks underneath them. conservationists say there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, because no other cull has only used drumlines. researchers at the university of western australia say the increased number of shark attacks in the state may be because western australia has the fastest-growing population in australia, not because of a rising number of sharks.richard peirce, of the uk-based conservation charity, the shark trust, said that the cull would not work and could bring more predators towards the coast. òthe activity in western australia is adding to the human tragedy of shark attacks. it is very sad that a government has ignored the best advice and chosen a method that is ineffective and counterproductive,ó he said, òand, even if they monitor drumlines through the day, leaving the lines in at night could attract other predators to the area, attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured.óworldwide, in 2012, there were 80 attacks by sharks. seven of the attacks were fatal. this is compared to nearly 100 million sharks killed by humans each year. rspca australia says it believes the cull is wrong. òthere is no evidence that the increase in attacks is a result of increasing shark numbers. we think it is the result of a changing population and changing human behaviour; that is, there are more people in the water,ó it said.richard branson said the idea was not working. òiõm sure one of the reasons western australia premier, colin barnett, did it was because he was thinking it would encourage tourism. itõs going to do the opposite, i think. youõre advertising a problem that doesnõt exist in a big way and youõre going to stop people from wanting to come to perth and your beautiful countryside around it. all youõre going to achieve, i think, is to worry people.ó
elementary	bb king was most famous for blues music but he was always interested in other types of music and different cultures. perhaps it is too early to say he is òthe last of the bluesmenó but it is hard to imagine that any future blues artist will have the in uence as bb king. he in uenced thousands of musicians and millions of music fans in a career that lasted 65 years.riley b king was born in mississippi, the son of african-american farm workers. he learnt the guitar from a family friend and learnt to sing with a quartet of gospel singers. in his early 20s, he moved to memphis.he was soon playing regularly at a bar in west memphis and he also became a disc jockey, with a show on a local radio station. he was known as òthe beale street blues boyó but this was shortened to òblues boy kingó and then to òbbó. in 1950, king began recording for modern records.he had his  rst hit in 1952 with three oõclock blues. it was number one in the r&b chart for 15 weeks; it was the  rst of many hits. king developed a style that was new and different but had its roots in blues history. he often praised the musicians who in uenced him and he usually mentioned t-bone walker  rst. he also mentioned the earlier blues guitarists blind lemon jefferson and lonnie johnson and the jazz players charlie christian and django reinhardt.he once explained that his guitar technique was partly the result of his lack of skill: òi started to bend notes because i could never play in the bottleneck style. i loved that sound but just couldnõt do it.ó during the 1950s, king was the leading blues artist in many series of concerts. in 1956, he played 342 concerts. in 1962, he tried to change that working pattern by signing with a major label, abc. but the  rst records under that contract were not very successful with his fans or with the record company. but his 1965 album, live at the regal, has become famous and in uenced many younger musicians. he had more r&b hits with blues songs and, in 1969, he was near the top of the pop charts ð where no blues artist had been for many years ð with a song called the thrill is gone.it was a long time before he became known to a rock audience but musicians who admired him brought him to the attention of rock fans. òabout a year and a half ago,ó he said in 1969, òkids suddenly started saying to me, ôyouõre the greatest blues guitarist in the world.õ and iõd say, ôwho told you that?õ and theyõd say, ômike bloom eldõ or ôeric claptonõ. these young musicians made me popular again.ófrom then on, king was well known as a leading blues artist. he went on international concert tours to japan, australia, china and russia. he also gave concerts to prisoners in chicago and at san quentin. in 1990, doctors told king he had diabetes and he reduced his touring. he now had to play sitting down but his singing and playing were almost as good as ever. the celebrations for his 80th birthday, in 2005, included an award-winning album with clapton, mark knop er, roger daltrey, gloria estefan and others, tributes from bono, amadou bagayoko and elton john, and a ògoodbye touró that was not a goodbye at all.in 2009, king received a grammy award, for best traditional blues album, for one kind favor. in 2012, he performed at a concert at the white house, where the us president, barack obama, joined him to sing sweet home chicago. king was twice married and twice divorced. he is survived by 11 children by various partners; four others died before him.nannan

elementary	emmanuel limal wanted to find love on online dating sites but he was tired of meeting women who said that they weren’t ready to start a family. the 43-year-old actor, who is from france, has lived in copenhagen for 20 years. he was looking for love and wanted to start a family. he tried to find someone online but without success.“everyone said that they were really active, always travelling or with a long list of hobbies, but they didn’t talk about children,” limal said. “on some sites, there was an option to click saying: ‘i’d like kids someday,’ but i read the person’s profile and thought: ‘you will never have time!’ if someone’s going to the gym eight times a week and travelling every month, they are not putting a family first.”limal has a six-year-old daughter from an old relationship but he has always wanted more children. “i couldn’t meet anyone who wanted to start a family”. he said it was difficult to know when to talk about wanting kids when he met someone new. “it’s a difficult subject to talk about when you are on a date,” he said. “then one day i read a profile from a 38-year-old who said she knew it was ‘really bad to admit’ but she wanted children. and i thought: ‘you shouldn’t be ashamed of this.’”limal borrowed money to start babyklar.nu – or ‘baby-ready now’ in english. it works like a normal dating site but everyone is asked to be honest about their wish to start a family soon. “we ask people if they are ok with someone who already has children and if they want another baby,” limal said. “but we don’t make them say how many children they would like. that would be like food shopping online.”he has had a very positive response to the site. “fifty people signed up every hour when we started in june. there are already couples who met through the site and are now together. i think we will have the first babyklar.nu baby by next summer.” more men have signed up than women (53% to 47%), with comments such as “i can finally be honest about what i want.”the site has come at the right time for the country of five million people. danes are not having enough children and the current rate of 1.7 children per family means that the population is falling. the usual reasons are given – women are leaving it “too late” and couples are living together without getting married and waiting to start families.“now, i hope, men and women who want to start a family but haven’t met the right person yet will have another choice,” says limal. he says that this isn’t just about making babies: “i want this to be about children and love. my goal is to bring together people who really want a family and a partner – and who’ll stay together. i’m a romantic.”he is planning to start sites in france and the uk later in 2013, but at the moment the only site is in denmark. “danes have no problem having children before marriage so things can move fast and, because the country’s so small, someone from jutland can date someone from copenhagen without too much travel,” limal said. and limal has finally found love. “i’ve met a nice woman and she wants a baby too – so we shall see.”
elementary	in iceland, you can be called aagot, arney or ásfríður; baldey, bebba or brá. dögg, dimmblá, etna and eybjört are fine and so are frigg, glódís, hörn and ingunn. jórlaug is ok and so are obba, sigurfljóð, úranía and vagna. but, if you are a girl in iceland, you cannot be called harriet.“the situation is silly,” said tristan cardew, a british cook who moved to iceland in 2000. with his icelandic wife, kristin, cardew is appealing against a decision by the national registry in the capital reykjavik – the registry decided not to renew the cardew’s ten-year-old daughter harriet’s passport because it does not recognize her first name.the registry does not recognize the name of harriet’s 12-year-old brother duncan either, so, until now, the two children have travelled on passports with the names stúlka and drengur cardew, which mean girl and boy cardew. but, this time, the registry has decided to apply the law. “and the law says no official document will be given to people who do not have an approved icelandic name.”the situation meant the family were going to miss their holiday in france but they have applied to the british embassy for an emergency uk passport, which should now allow them to leave.names are important in iceland, a country of only 320,000 people. the law says that – unless both parents are foreign – the names of children born in iceland must be submitted to the national registry within six months of birth. if a name is not on a recognized list of 1,853 female and 1,712 male names, the parents must get approval from the icelandic naming committee.about 5,000 children are born in iceland each year and the committee receives about 100 applications. it rejects about half of these names because it wants to preserve the icelandic language. there is a law that says names must be able to have icelandic grammatical endings and should be written using the ordinary rules of icelandic spelling.what this means is that names with letters that do not officially exist in iceland’s 32-letter alphabet, such as “c”, are not permitted. also, names that cannot be used with the case endings used in icelandic are also rejected. “that was the problem with harriet,” said cardew.the country’s naming laws have been criticized in recent years: in 2013, blær – “light breeze” – bjarkardóttir rúnarsdottir won the right to be officially called her name, not “girl”. the former mayor of reykjavik, jón gnarr, has also called iceland’s naming law “unfair, stupid and against creativity”.the cardews could solve harriet’s problem by giving her an icelandic middle name. “but it’s a bit late for that and much too silly,” said cardew. “are they saying they don’t want us here?”nan
elementary	a new study shows that there are more and more brown bears, wolves and lynx in the forests and suburban areas of europe. rising human populations and use of resources have made many people believe that these animals could soon become extinct. but the study says that numbers of large predators are stable or rising in europe.brown bears, wolves and the eurasian lynx are found in nearly one-third of mainland europe (excluding belarus, ukraine and russia). most live outside nature reserves – this shows that changing attitudes and conservation methods are protecting these species very well.bears are the most common large carnivore in europe – there are around 17,000 bears. there are 12,000 wolves and 9,000 eurasian lynx. only belgium, denmark, the netherlands and luxembourg in mainland europe have no breeding populations of at least one large carnivore species. britain also has none. but the study said these animals live in regions of europe where lots of people live and this shows that they could live even in the british countryside.guillaume chapron from sweden’s university of agricultural sciences and researchers across europe found wolves living in suburban areas with up to 3,050 people per square kilometre. on average in europe, wolves live on land where there are 37 people per square kilometre, lynx in areas where there are 21 people per square kilometre and bears where there are 19 people per square kilometre. in the scottish highlands there are just nine people per square kilometre.“to have wolves, we don’t need to remove people from the landscape,” said chapron. he also said that the big carnivore revival shows the success of a “land-sharing” method of conservation – it is different from the method in north america and africa, where they use fences to separate these animals in “wilderness” areas.“i’m not saying it’s a perfect love story – living together often means conflict – but it’s important to control that conflict and resolve the problems it causes. wolves can be difficult neighbours,” said chapron.according to the researchers, countries in other parts of the world could use this “land-sharing” method. land-sharing works in europe because there are more and more animals such as wild deer for the predators to eat and there is money for electric fences to protect livestock fences, so farmers do not have to shoot wild predators. most important, said chapron, is the eu habitats directive, which has forced member states to protect and revive rare species.“without the habitats directive, i don’t think we would have had this revival,” he said. “it shows that we can protect animals, if people really want to help and if politicians make strong laws.” author george monbiot was happy about the revival. he is starting a charity called rewilding britain. it encourages the return of wild landscape and extinct species.“it is great to see more of these animals in europe. but britain is completely different – we’ve lost more of our large animals than any country except for ireland,” he said. “we accidentally reintroduced wild boar but we’ve done nothing else. in much of the rest of europe we’ve got bears, lynx and wolves coming back. if it works in the rest of europe, there’s absolutely no reason why it can’t work in the uk,” he said. he added that bears and wolves live less than an hour away from rome. “there’s no reason why we can’t have a similar return of wildlife in the uk.”nannan
elementary	"the age of the big british summer music festival, including glastonbury, is ending, according to the top rock manager harvey goldsmith.he has produced and worked with most of the western worldõs biggest music stars, including the who, the rolling stones, queen, madonna, bob dylan and luciano pavarotti. he says that the biggest problem is a serious lack of major new bands to follow on from the old ones.òthe age of the music festival peaked about two years ago,ó he said, speaking at the hay festival of literature and arts in wales. òthere are too many festivals and there are not enough big bands to headline them. that is a big, big problem for us. and we are not producing new bands that can headline ð like the rolling stones, muse, even the arctic monkeys.óthere were about 900 music festivals in the uk between may and september in 2014, he said, and they cannot all continue. there will be lots of small combination festivals where it isnõt just music but also poetry or books or magic shows.goldsmith, 69, said that he is working with robin de levita, the dutch producer of the whoõs 1970s rock musical tommy. they will bring the  rst stage adaptation of the teen book and movie series the hunger games to a new 1,100-seat theatre in wembley, london, in june 2016.talking at hay, goldsmith also revealed some of the secrets of his long career in the music industry. he said that keith moon put dynamite down a sydney hotel room toilet to unblock it. and, he said that john lennon had stage fright at madison square garden in 1974 ð he vomited and they had to push him onto the stage. òitõs bizarre how common stage fright is among artists. itõs odd how afraid they get but, as soon as the music starts, theyõre  ne,ó he said.he also gave the answer to a rock õnõ roll mystery: why elvis presley never performed outside north america. presleyõs manager, colonel tom parker, told goldsmith that the real reason why elvis never performed in england was because parker was an immigrant.òhe explained that it was because he was an illegal dutch immigrant. he didnõt want to risk leaving the us,ó said goldsmith.and his ultimate rock õnõ roll performer? òfreddie mercury was our most powerful stage performer, the best live performer weõve ever had.óbut there is no group to follow queen, he said. òweõre not producing a new generation of this kind of band. coldplay is probably the last one and that was ten years ago.""so, with no big bands to headline, there are no big shows. glastonbury now canõt  nd any more big bands. the time of big music festivals is really ending.ónannannan"
advanced	introduction did you know that, in the uk, there is no legal requirement for restaurants to pass on tips to staff?itõs a fact thatõs covered in a government-led review, released in may 2016, in which workers, employers and customers were asked their views on the tipping process. off the back of it, ministers said they were keen to change rules and make sure low-paid workers get the money left for them by grateful customers. the government have announced a two-month consultation on proposals that they said would stamp out unfairness.among the reviewõs revelations was the fact that some waiters are charged up to a 15% administration fee on tips they are left by credit or debit cards. in some restaurants, the government has seen evidence of waiters being forced to hand over their own cash, if they donõt collect enough tips, to cover these fees. the government said it would consider prohibiting employers from charging workers an admin fee or any other deductions.the government also said that it wanted customers to know that tips are voluntary, calling for the system to be made more transparent, with restaurants clearly displaying their tips policy.we asked waiters around the uk what they think of the tipping process (including how much they take home from tips and whether itõs fair) and what would improve it for them.1. rodri, 37, london: ôaround 50% of a waiterõs income is tipsõ average tips: £60 per eight-hour shift i think they treat waiters best in ... the useverything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015. this is when it was revealed that dozens of restaurants were exposed for skimming tips from staff for administration fees. however, you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains. iõve heard of restaurants not paying their chefs a share of the tronc (a payment arrangement used to distribute tips). some restaurants will take 4% of all sales to pay the chefs and as an admin fee. so, if you sell £1,000 worth of food, the company will take £40. this is regardless of how much you make in tips. this means that if a table has a £100 bill and doesnõt tip, the waiter has to pay £4 of their own money. this leads to a money-grabbing culture and, ironically, to bad service. if a table doesnõt tip, the waiter feels as if they are being robbed by the company and ends up resenting the customers.i can average around £60 in tips per shift but, on a good night, this goes up to over £100 and, on a poor night, itõs around £40. around 50% of a waiterõs income is tips. all restaurants should have to publicly state their exact tipping procedure. america has it pretty good ð everyone tips.2. elle, 22, edinburgh: ôwe never know whether itõs fairõ average tips: £20 per eight-hour shift i think they treat waiters best in ... francei work three jobs, all on part-time zero-hours contracts, in catering and hospitality. my main day job is in a cafe_ where the small number of staff work both front of house and in the kitchen so all our tips get put in a pot and shared equally. my main evening job is at a restaurant where we donõt get our tips but our wages are minimum wage plus an extra £2.50 per hour (which apparently has been worked out to account for average tips when shared with the kitchen staff). my third job is events catering and nobody ever tips.in restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips through card payments, the staff never actually see how much is getting tipped ð so we donõt know whether weõre getting our fair share or not. the system seems better in france, where they donõt tip much but waiting tables is seen as a proper job, offering job security and a decent income.3. ashley, 22, london: ôtips go towards customer breakagesõ average tips: £10-15 per eight-hour shift i think they treat waiters best in ... australiai work in a south-east london pub in the evenings and i do day shifts at a local restaurant. in both places, tips are all collected and shared out at the end of the night. money is also taken from the tip jar to cover breakages by either staff or customers. if a member of the team gets off early, they will rarely see their tips because they are shared out just before the pub closes.it is incredibly unfair that our tips are shared out, especially when one member of the team underperforms. equally, when a member of the team does incredibly well, they donõt get what theyõve earned. itõs really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers. the managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips. i make around £20 a shift but would only be given £10-15 of that money.when i am tipped well, the tips hugely impact on my  nances. occasionally, i will earn over £50 in one night, which almost doubles my earnings for that day. however, i never get more than £30 of that money after it has been shared out. i really rely on tips because i am only paid £7 an hour.iõd rather we earned a good basic wage (like in australia) and therefore didnõt have to rely on tips to make ends meet.4. tom, manchester: ôa big night of tips can help pay the rentõ average tips: £40 per eight-hour shift i think they treat waiters best in ... italywhere i used to work,  oor staff kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips. the other 20% of cash went into a pot for the commis waiters and service bar. the 60% went into a tronc system, which helped boost kitchen salaries. iõm not actually sure if this was to help pay the agreed salary or provide bonuses.itõs hard to say how much i earned a shift; maybe around £40, £20 from card tips. it can make a massive change to your weekly  nances. sometimes, people needed a big night to be able to pay their rent.they have got tipping right in italy, where people donõt add a service charge but usually round up their bill so, if they get a meal for û19, they leave a û20 note and donõt ask for change. they respect the staff and you often see people making a career out of waiting and the experience shows.
advanced	how far away are we from a world where drones deliver packages? if amazon is to be believed, not far at all. others are not so sure: technical progress past this point isnõt merely a matter of invention; itõs a matter of public safety.paul misener, amazonõs vice-president of global public policy, told a congressional hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place ð but misener gave no hints as to what that would look like beyond joking with a congressman that there was a basket of fresh fruit on the way to his doorstep to demonstrate the technologyõs viability.the federal aviation authority (faa) will  nally have regulations governing the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by june 2016. but the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines arenõt airway-legal at all yet ð only drones up to 25kg will be covered and the faa points out in the proposed rules that, if youõre going to crowd the skies with radio-controlled  ying robots, they had better all be using different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack.professor sajiv singh of carnegie mellon university robotics institute, who runs a òcritical cargo deliveryó company called nearearth, said that piloting a state-of-the-art drone was a little more like leaving it a trail of breadcrumbs: go to this altitude, perform this short task, go back home. but even short  ights from a mobile landing pad pose serious logistical problems, he said.òtheyõre not proposing to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; theyõre proposing to deliver from a warehouse to where the consumer is, which is likely an urban area or a suburban area,ó he said. òin those particular cases, there are going to be hazards along the way that the vehicle is going to have to detect. maybe there will be terrain that the map doesnõt know about, unless youõve mapped that exact route before. even then, maybe thereõs construction equipment that wasnõt there but is there now. maybe gps signals are blocked or partially blocked, in which case itõs going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.ó all this is surmountable, he said ð but itõs difficult.one major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks. òif you have an off-the-shelf uav [unmanned aerial vehicle], itõll just keep going and crash into the ground,ó said roboticist daniel huber. thatõs not a hard problem for an engineer to  x; itõs just that the  x isnõt yet an industry standard.furthermore, òyou canõt do everything with a 25kg aircraftó, said jay mcconville, director of business development for unmanned systems at defence and business contractor lockheed martin mst. much of the focus at lockheed martin has been on making drone piloting interfaces less like elaborate  ight simulators. òthose of us in the aircraft business have to remind ourselves that the operator doesnõt really care about every little thing about the aircraft and wants instead to focus on the end result,ó he said. òoperators want to see vehicle status information; they want to see video on their handheld device or their laptop.óòtechnologically, most of the things that are needed for this are in place,ó said huber. he is working on a program that proposes using drones to inspect infrastructure ð pipelines, telephone lines, bridges and so on. òweõve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and itõll autonomously  y around that area and look at every surface and then report back.óhuber, a senior scientist at carnegie mellonõs robotics institute, where he works on 3d systems imagery, said with respect to a program like amazonõs: òi have heard them say that many packages are lightweight ð a drone can carry a kilogram for 15 minutes. if you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood, it can deliver from that base. you need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have about that distance.ó itõs one way, he said, of making sure the surrounding population is relatively safe. òthe larger you get, the more dangerous you get.ólogistical problems are in the middle of being solved in some very dramatic ways, huber said. at a recent conference, he said, a disaster relief drone  rm, skycatch, demonstrated a robot that could autonomously take off and, when it got tired, land on its own charging station. òit would land and take off and, when it ran low on batteries, it would land, exchange the batteries and take off again,ó he said.of course, safety remains a major concern ð singh points out that, for a commercial aircraft to be considered skyworthy, it has to prove a rate of one serious failure every 1m hours. drones, he said, are òone or two orders of magnitude awayó from that benchmark. òthe reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours,ó singh said. an oil leak, by the way, doesnõt count as catastrophic failure ð something has to fall out of the sky. òweõre closing the gap,ó singh said. òthereõs a lot of interest.ópart of this is simply that air travel is inherently dangerous and, thus, standards are much higher. òif you  y commercial airlines, often theyõll say, ôoh, a component has failed ð we have to go back to the gate,õó singh said. òand thatõs an established industry with 60 years of legacy! i shudder to think that one of these things might come down on a crowded highway.ó part of the solution, singh said, is simple contingency planning: òif things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.ó
advanced	brazil’s latest funk sensation, anitta, has won millions of fans by taking the favela sound into the mainstream, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour.anti-discrimination campaigners and social commentators say the music industry’s fastest rising star has had to sacrifice her blackness to make it into the predominantly white middleclass market.the controversy was prompted by the publication of then-and-now photographs that show a dramatic lightening of anitta’s skin tone since she signed a deal with warner.in the first, when she was relatively unknown, she looked darker. in the second – a marketing shot after she became famous – she seems paler. whether this was the result of whitening products and cosmetic surgery or – more likely – photoshop tweaks, the contrast has rekindled discussion about whether you need to be pale to get ahead in brazil.jarid arraes, a psychology student and blogger, wrote a post criticizing the latent discrimination in media and marketing that she felt anitta’s image change represented. “people refuse to accept that they are racist and they think they live in a multiracial democracy, but the statistics show that is far from the case. the whitening shows us a profoundly intolerant society that doesn’t support diversity. white is the image of the rich, the nice, the successful, the good, while people see black as the opposite of all that.”born larissa de macedo machado, the diva-to-be was a church chorister in her childhood. in her teens, she made a name for herself in rio de janeiro’s baile funk scene as a dancer and singer.she has now exploded into the public consciousness with an album and a huge hit single, show das poderosas, which topped the charts and attracted 52 million youtube views.though adored first and foremost as a pop idol with a strong message and some catchy tunes, her backers project her as a cultural bridge between the predominantly black and mixed-race shanty towns on rio’s hillsides and the wealthier and whiter communities below.she has toned down the suggestive dancing, gangsta references and explicit lyrics of baile funk. now, however, questions are being asked about whether she – or her marketing team – have gone too far in re-tailoring her image to attract a more lucrative demographic. “if pop stars have curly hair, they are going to feel coerced into straightening it. if they have a big nose, they will be coerced into getting rhinoplasty,” said arraes. “it creates a vicious cycle for self-esteem.”this is a sensitive topic in this largely mixed-raced nation. brazil – one of the last big countries in the world to ban slavery – has the largest population of african descent outside africa, but race and ancestry are less important here than colour. and, despite the nation’s goal of being a multiracial democracy, there is a clear link between skin tone and inequality.in brazilian cities, white workers earn roughly twice as much as those of african descent. up until 2011, black or mixed-race students also spent two years less at school on average.the government says the gap is closing thanks to quota systems for university places and other forms of affirmative action. but the gulf remains glaringly apparent. the vast majority of business and government executives are white, while most menial jobs are done by black and mixed-race workers. walk through ipanema, gávea or other upmarket districts and you are far more likely to see black nannies pushing strollers with white toddlers than a white nanny pushing a black child.defining colour is complex. people who define themselves as white were in the minority for the first time in the most recent census in 2010. among the 197 million population, 82 million said they were “pardu” (mixed race), 15 million black, two million asian and 0.5% indigenous.sylvio ferreira, a psychology lecturer at the federal university of pernambuco, believes anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it tamer and more palatable to everyone.“was this achieved by racial whitening? no,” he said. “what happened was a change of the social space where anitta produced her art: from the periphery to the centre.”others agree that the issue of colour is overblown. maycon de mattos batista, a financial analyst who worked with anitta while she was an intern, said there had been a huge change in anitta’s image, but not of her colour.“i don’t believe it’s whitening; it’s more the way they are producing her with makeup, hairstylists and the way she dresses,” he said. “i don’t think that was because of pressure being put on her. she always liked to show off, sing and dance. that was a natural thing for her. i believe that it is because of this naturalness that she is where she is today.”leandro silva de souza, a racial equality activist in the north-eastern city of salvador, said the prejudice lay not with society but with music producers and media executives. the public, he said, proved they were interested in music for its own sake by choosing ellen oléria – a black lesbian – as the recent winner of the talent show the voice brazil.the guardian was unable to reach anitta for comment. but, in a recent interview, she described the need for identity to be self-defined.“all-powerful is a woman who doesn’t need to be beautiful, but she has so much attitude that she is marvellous, she is powerful. what i try to pass on in my work for everyone is that we can be who we want.”
advanced	although much of his work, and arguably nearly all the best of it, was  rmly within the discipline of the blues, bb king was always open-minded and interested when he found himself in other settings, bridging musical and cultural differences with affability and skill. perhaps it is premature to speak of òthe last of the bluesmenó but it is hard to imagine any future blues artist matching kingõs in uence over musicians by the thousand and audiences by the million in a career spanning 65 years.riley b king (the b did not seem to stand for a name) was born near itta bena, mississippi and grew up with the limited prospects of an african-american agricultural worker, a barrier he gradually worked to overcome as he learnt the basics of guitar from a family friend and honed his singing with a quartet of gospel singers. in his early 20s, he moved to memphis.within a couple of years, he was playing regularly at a bar in west memphis, arkansas. he also became a disc jockey, presenting a show on a memphis radio station. his billing, òthe beale street blues boyó, was shortened to òblues boy kingó and thence to òbbó. after a single session in 1949 for a nashville label, king began recording for the west coast-based modern records in 1950.he had his  rst hit in 1952, with a dramatic rearrangement of three oõclock blues, which topped the r&b chart for 15 weeks; it was the  rst of a list of successes such as please love me, you upset me baby and sweet sixteen. on these and his dozens of other recordings, most of them his own compositions, king developed a style that was both innovative and rooted in blues history. he was always ready to praise the musicians who had in uenced him and would usually mention t-bone walker first.òiõve tried my best to get that sound,ó he told the guitar player magazine. òi came pretty close but never quite got it.ó in an interview in 2001, he said: òif t-bone walker had been a woman i would have asked him to marry me.ó but he would also cite the earlier blues guitarists blind lemon jefferson and lonnie johnson and the jazz players charlie christian and django reinhardt.he once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill: òi started to bend notes because i could never play in the bottleneck style, like elmore james and booker white. i loved that sound but just couldnõt do it.ó he was similarly self-deprecating about his singing, a sumptuous blend of honey and lemon, mixed half-and-half from crooners such as nat king cole and blues shouters such as joe turner and dr clayton. probably his favourite composer and singer was louis jordan, whose music he commemorated in the 1999 album let the good times roll.throughout the 1950s, king was the leading blues artist on the circuit of black-patronized theatres and clubs on an interminable series of one-nighters. in 1956, he is supposed to have  lled 342 engagements. in 1962, he tried to change that working pattern by signing with a major label, abc, but the  rst records under that contract, which tried to reshape him as a mainstream pop singer, were as unsatisfactory to his admirers as they were to abcõs accountants.the 1965 album live at the regal, however, proved the durability of kingõs blues repertoire and has become iconic, a turning point in the early listening of many younger musicians. he had further r&b hits with blues numbers including how blue can you get and paying the cost to be the boss, and, in 1969, he hit the upper reaches of the pop charts ð where no blues artist had been for many years ð with the thrill is gone.it took him a while to establish himself with a rock audience, for whom the blues was largely de ned by the chicago school of muddy waters and howlinõ wolf but he was brought to their attention by musicians who admired him. òabout a year and a half ago,ó he said in 1969, òall of a sudden, kids started coming up to me saying, ôyouõre the greatest blues guitarist in the world.õ and iõd say, ôwho told you that?õ and theyõd say, ômike bloom eldõ or ôeric claptonõ. itõs to these youngsters that i owe my new popularity.ó he acquired further rock credibility with the 1970 album indianola mississippi seeds, on which he collaborated with carole king and joe walsh.from then on, king was  rmly established as òthe chairman of the board of blues singersó. guided by his manager, sidney seidenberg, he embarked on international concert tours that took him to japan, australia, china and russia. he also gave concerts to prisoners at the cook county jail in chicago and at san quentin, experiences that led to his long involvement in rehabilitation programmes.in 1990, king was diagnosed with diabetes and cut back his touring but not so much that his followers outside the us could not catch up with him every year or two. though he would now deliver most of his act seated, the strength of his singing and the  uency of his playing were only very gradually diminished. the celebrations for his 80th birthday, in 2005, included an award-winning album of collaborations with clapton, mark knop er, roger daltrey, gloria estefan and others, tributes from musicians as diverse as bono, amadou bagayoko and elton john, and a òfarewell touró that proved not to be a farewell at all.in 2009, king received a grammy award, for best traditional blues album, for one kind favor. in 2012, he performed at a concert at the white house, where the us president, barack obama, joined him to sing sweet home chicago. king was twice married and twice divorced. he is survived by 11 children by various partners; four others predeceased him.
advanced	it could be the best thing since trevor baylis’s wind-up radio in the pre-internet 1990s – a cheap light that draws free power from gravity and could end the use of dangerous kerosene-fuelled lamps in africa and india.but when british designer, patrick hunt, went down the conventional route of bank or venture capital finance to get his invention kickstarted commercially, he hit a problem. “we tried to get funding to make it happen, but it’s slow and complex and it’s unproven and nobody wants to take a risk,” he said.so he tried crowdfunding on a us website, indiegogo, which had recently opened up in the uk. within five days, he had hit his target and raised £36,200. so popular was his campaign at the end of 2012 to entice donations from the public that within 40 days he had raised a colossal £400,000.the led light is powered by a dynamo driven by the descent of a 10kg bag of rocks. the weight is attached to the light, lifted to a height of about 2m, and while it is allowed to slowly fall to the ground it will generate enough power for half an hour of light.hunt is preparing for production in china and will test the market again by delivering 1,000 of the lights to africa before the full mass production of what he hopes will be millions of units.he is one of a new wave of entrepreneurs turning to the fast-growing crowdfunding industry for finance. another new site is investingzone, which matches wealthy individuals with start-up entrepreneurs.indiegogo does not offer shares but allows users to offer “perks” for different levels of donation – those helping to fund hunt’s innovative light not only got to feel good about helping the less well off but also got their own light.for danae ringelmann, co-founder of indiegogo, the “gravity light” is a perfect example of how meritocratic crowdfunding can be and how it can test an entrepreneur’s idea. “it is the first time that finance has been fast, efficient and meritocratic, because it is not about ‘how do i get access to the decision makers in that bank?’ or ‘who do i know in that venture capital outfit?’ this is all about proving your worth to your customers and fans, getting them to validate your idea and fund it.“even ideas that aren’t deemed worthy to get funding are worth testing, because you will have saved yourself a whole bunch of time finding out it wasn’t a good idea and getting smarter faster,” she says.ringelmann, who is based in the us, started her career as a wall street analyst. in 2008, she decided to quit and use her skills to try and help friends who worked in the arts to raise money.the site was originally focused on the film business and launched at the sundance film festival that year.five years on and it is raising about $2m a week for new businesses in start-up and growth stages. in december 2012, it launched a euro and a sterling service to get a foothold this side of the atlantic and says britain is its third biggest market. international activity is up 41% since december.there is no shortage of competitors, be it kickstarter, seedrs or funding circle, but, unlike rivals, says ringelmann, indiegogo is the only crowdfunder where anyone can launch a campaign. no project is deemed too wacky.the site levies a 4% fee for successful campaigns. for those that fail to raise their target amount, users have the option of either refunding all money to their contributors at no charge or keeping all money raised but with a 9% fee.a british woman, lauren pears, raised £100,000 to open a “cat café” in london through the site. known as lady dinah’s cat emporium, it is yet to open but is billed as somewhere people can “come in from the cold to a comfortable wingback chair, a hot cup of tea, a book and a cat”.“we’ve seen campaigns that go to venture capitalists get rejected because the venture guys say, ‘great idea but no idea if the market actually wants it; it could be a gadget that no one cares about,’” said ringelmann.“the entrepreneurs do an indiegogo campaign – they don’t even actually launch the project, but the campaign itself is enough market proof for venture capitalists to say there is a market for this.“it allows you to test your market, test your pricing, test your features, discover new revenue streams, get vital feedback,” says ringelmann.with her wall street background and the experience of helping 100,000 businesses and services raise finance, ringelmann has fine-tuned her advice for the budding entrepreneur.“ideas are a dime a dozen. it’s all about the execution and, if you are afraid that your idea will be stolen by someone who could execute it better and faster than you, then you are not the right person to execute that idea. it’s all about confidence to move fast and to learn,” she says.for ringelmann, the expansion into europe and a deal with a web transaction provider, which will allow payments to be made through local card services like maestro in the uk and carte bleue in france, as well as paypal, are part of a dream to democratize finance. more than 7,000 campaigns for finance are live on the site.while crowdfunding as an alternative to banks has grown, it has limited appeal to big-bucks investors, who don’t settle for anything less than a stake in a promising business. that could start to change in the uk with the launch of investingzone.
advanced	setting aside epic disaster-movie moments such as volcanoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, there are two key natural factors that can make a city vulnerable to gradual disintegration or even total disappearance ð water and sand.were climate change making the planet colder rather than hotter, we could add ice to the list ð for nothing obliterates a city like a billion-tonne glacier grinding its way down a valley. the impact of a rare òice tsunamió in 2013 on the canadian municipality of ochre beach was just a taster: a wall of melting iceberg on dauphin lake was blown by winds on to the shore, splintering every house in its path.but ochre beach was an anomaly. elsewhere, the planetõs melting ice is making cities vulnerable by the less dramatic route of raising sea levels. a century ago, venice ð one of the most beautiful and low-lying cities in the world ð used to  ood around ten times a year. nowadays, its lowest point, piazza san marco (only three feet above sea level) is inundated with water approximately 100 times annually.but rising sea levels are not entirely to blame. in many parts of the world, the land is also sinking ð in veniceõs case, subsoil compaction (a result of industrial exploitation of the surrounding area) lowered the city by 20cm between 1950 and 1970. ho chi minh city in vietnam is also sinking by about 2cm a year ð but thatõs nothing compared to jakarta, which is dropping 10 to 20cm annually. in the past three decades, the city has sunk roughly four metres, rendering its 40-year-old seawall ever less effective.unfortunately for the indonesian capital, it has pumped out so much groundwater to support its population that the land above is drying out and compacting, thereby creating a bowl. rivers that used to  ow through the city down to the sea have had to be diverted because they cannot drain uphill.while there are many plans to save venice ð and ho chi minh city and jakarta are taking the problem seriously ð the same cannot be said for miami, where politicians refuse to admit the city has a severe environmental problem.miamiõs dif culties are threefold. the florida resort lies less than ten feet above sea level; an increasing number of tropical storms are inundating the city; and it is built on porous limestone, which is absorbing the rising seawater. this water then  lls the cityõs foundations and bubbles up through drains and pipes, forcing sewage upwards and polluting its fresh water. there is every chance miami may one day become uninhabitable.in the maldives, the populations of whole islands are now looking to abandon their homes. the capital, male_, population 153,379 and only four feet above sea level, has used japanese investment to build a ten-foot sea wall at a cost of $63 million ð but, long term, only a stabilization of rising sea levels will save it and the rest of the islands.and itõs not just the sea ð rainfall is also endangering cities across the world. recently, an entire summerõs worth of rain fell in one morning on detroit, overwhelming its outdated sewerage systems. impoverished by the collapse of americaõs car industry, the city is struggling to build a system to cope. drinking water is also affected because detroit is particularly vulnerable to water-borne pathogens.in africa, deserti cation is causing the sahara to spread south at a rate of 30 miles per year, threatening settlements in northern mauritania. over the past 20 years, for example, the desert has grown by more than 260 acres around the trading and religious centre of chinguetti, which has seen its population decline from 20,000 people in the mid-twentieth century to just a few thousand now. trading has all but ceased as sand piles up in the streets.likewise, the californian resort of rancho mirage, near palm springs, may have to be abandoned in the next decade. this city is just one example of a problem caused not so much by global warming as human over-expansion in the face of  nite resources. californiaõs dream of farming the desert made sense while its total population remained around half a million (in 1870) ð but, now, the state is home to 38 million people, who, between them, own 32 million vehicles and expect to be surrounded by lawns and golf courses.the daily water use in rancho mirage is more than 200 gallons per person, which is giving rise to a man-made drought. a 25% cut in water consumption has been implemented but this is unlikely to stabilize the resort, which is surrounded by sand and dust. the long-term answer in californiaõs desert is likely to be the abandonment of some cities while consolidating the populations of others. human  ight is the  nal proof of a cityõs disintegration. once we stop maintaining a city, nature takes over very quickly. japanõs hashima island was turned into a concrete city in 1887 to exploit undersea coal reserves ð but, in 1974, with coal supplies nearing depletion, the mine was closed and hashima was abandoned. now, the sea spray is causing its concrete walls to collapse.fire is a growing threat to urban settlements in america ð in fact, forest  res cause the most damage after severe storms, with 800 major  re disasters having been declared there between 1953 and 2014. a newly released report by the usda forest service maps the increasing number of urban locations that are particularly vulnerable to wildfire. similarly, in australia, some of victoriaõs resorts and several melbourne suburbs have been placed on a list of the stateõs 52 most vulnerable bush re spots because long-term droughts are making trees highly combustible. itõs unlikely that a forest  re will ever destroy an entire city but a succession of  res could render it uninhabitable ð and abandonment remains one of the most powerful causes of urban collapse.many cities are  ghting a losing battle against the ravages of nature but is it possible to identify the worlds most vulnerable metropolis? natural events are notoriously hard to predict but the prospects for male do look particularly grim for, even if its new sea wall continues to be effective, the islands around the maldives capital are going to disappear before too long. and, if they disappear, so does males raison detre.
advanced	an atmosphere of melancholy and changing times pervades the opening to the final series of downton abbey. the year is 1925 and there are already the first rumblings of the economic storms that will blight the end of the decade. the neighbours are selling up their own stately home, while lord grantham seeks to cut back on servants after declaring that under-butlers are no longer affordable.but at the real downton abbey, highclere castle – a stately home owned by george “geordie” herbert, 8th earl of carnarvon – the financial outlook has rarely been brighter. according to lady fiona carnarvon, the huge global success of downton has funded a rolling programme of building repairs aimed at safeguarding highclere for the next generation.“it’s been an amazing magic carpet ride for all of us,” she said. “it’s given us a wonderful marketing platform, an international profile. i’m hugely grateful. my husband and i love the house, and the people here. now, without doubt, it is loved by millions of other people.”currently, only the ground and first floors of highclere, on the borders of hampshire, are used. but, a restoration project of derelict tower rooms has begun that will eventually allow visitors to climb up into the tower to an exhibition showcasing the work of the architect of the houses of parliament, sir charles barry, who rebuilt the house between 1839 and 1842.when the downton abbey producers first approached highclere in 2009, the family faced a near £12m repair bill, with urgent work priced at £1.8m. but, by 2012, the downton effect had begun to take the pressure off. lord carnarvon said then: “it was just after the banking crisis and it was gloom in all directions. we had been doing corporate functions but it all became pretty sparse after that. then, downton came along and it became a major tourist attraction.”visitor numbers doubled, to 1,200 a day, as downton abbey, scripted by julian fellowes, came to be screened around the world after becoming a hit in the uk in 2010 and, then, in the us. it is now broadcast in 250 countries.the formerly somewhat basic ticketing policy has become a computerized advance booking system, helping to guarantee foreign visitors admission. the accounts of highclere enterprises for 2014-15 show current assets have almost trebled to around £1m since 2012. gareth neame, the executive producer for the series, said: “i think downton abbey secured highclere’s future.”peter fincham, itv’s director of television, recalls the moment when highclere was booked. “i thought, ‘so what?’, because i had never heard of highclere castle. one stately home looks much the same as another. how wrong i was. the castle has been one enormous character as well.”the downton tourists are part of a growing phenomenon. visitbritain estimates that nearly 30% of foreign visitors, or nearly nine million people, include castles and historic houses on their itineraries. almost half of potential visitors to britain now say they want to indulge in “set jetting”, visiting places featured in films or on tv.more than a million embark on a tour of historic buildings each year, spending in excess of £1bn. from the biggest emerging tourist markets, 51% of brazilians, 42% of russians and chinese, and 35% of indian visitors are likely to include a visit to a site of interest in their trips.visitbritain’s director, patricia yates, said: “the links between tourism, films and tv are potent ones.” she added that period dramas have also raised the popularity of regions outside of london.neame is now an ambassador for the great britain campaign, which is backed by government departments and the british council, using it to promote the uk around the world. events include special downton-themed receptions at british embassies.neame said: “they approached me because of the reach. a lot of people here think of it as soapy entertainment. in other parts of the world, people revere our actors, our writing and production talent. it is something i am passionate about; i am a really strong believer in soft power. we are not nearly as proud of our achievements as we should be.“downton abbey is iconic for expressing britishness. really, it is a fantasy world, based in a particular time in history. it’s the first tv period drama that has really leapt out of the screen and become part of popular culture.”lady carnarvon is still keen to emphasize that the long-term future of highclere is not necessarily secure. “the bottom line is quite thin,” she said. “the programme has allowed us to spend faster on the buildings, have the follies restored.”in the pipeline is a tutankhamun centenary event in 2022, 100 years after the 5th earl of carnarvon, together with howard carter, discovered the tomb that revolutionized our understanding of egyptology. another opportunity to keep highclere in the public mind is the 300th anniversary of the birth of lancelot “capability” brown, who designed the grounds.“what you do is never sit on your laurels. every single day, don’t take anything for granted,” said lady carnarvon. “for all these great houses, you have to invest in them. and, there has been a deficit since the 1930s. perhaps, in the past, an estate and house defined and supported the family and their lifestyle but, today, it is quite the reverse: the challenge is how geordie and i seek to support and look after highclere.“from my point of view, i’ve tried to persuade people it is fun and have specific events they can engage with, not just a wander around a dusty house. we have to compete with attractions like the london dungeon.”
advanced	the roof is plastic held up by a crooked tree trunk and the desks just a jumble of cast-off chairs, but the students inside the chemin des dunes school are studying with the same intensity you would find in a seminar at oxford university. at stake is the hope of a new life in france.“the french language is very difficult but we try hard. if we come every day, maybe we can touch our dreams,” says kamal, a refugee from sudan’s war-torn darfur district who comes to three or four hours of classes every day. “it’s a good thing to keep your brain active.”the 29-year-old electrical engineer is one of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of refugees living in the “jungle” camp outside calais who have applied for asylum in france and are eager to learn the language of what they hope will be their new home.like many of his fellow students, he is frustrated that media coverage of the sprawling tentvillage has focused only on those who use it as a staging post for risky nightly bids to sneak on board cross-channel lorries or trains.“i need to tell people in the uk, they think that everyone wants to go there. but there are a lot of people here who want to stay in france,” kamal said.france is already home to more than a quarter of a million refugees, according to united nations data – the country has taken in more than twice as many as the uk, even though the countries have similar populations.there are a further 56,000 asylum seekers waiting for their claim to a french safe haven to be processed – the second highest number in europe – while, in the uk, there are 36,000.while the applicants wait for an answer, though, france does not provide them with any financial support or allow them to work – and the slow process can take many months. the jungle camp offers a free meal a day and a plastic roof over their heads so many decide to endure the basic conditions for a few extra months, rather than potentially jeopardize their asylum bid by working illegally.the idea for the school was first touted by some of that group at the start of the summer, when they were bored with sitting around waiting and nervous about starting a new life in france totally unable to communicate. it was a reality within weeks, opening on 11 july.“we did it to reunite the ‘brothers’ and, at the same time, they can learn french,” said zimarco jones, the school’s nigerian founder, who arrived in calais in 2013 and is still waiting for his asylum claim to be processed. “now, we need to build another one,” he says with a grin.at its busiest, the tiny classroom holds 30 pupils, crammed into five rows of desks in front of a big green chalkboard and pictures of cartoon animals for each letter of the french alphabet. there are also classes in english, art and t’ai chi but the biggest draw is the french lessons, provided by volunteers from calais and beyond.“french is not as easy as english but, two weeks ago, i decided there was no way to get to the uk,” says george, another darfur refugee and dedicated student. he wanted to cross the channel because he speaks fluent english but, with language classes, he says he is happy to settle in france.“anywhere there is peace, i can stay, no problem,” he says, already waiting at the classroom more than half an hour before his teachers arrive.he admits he doesn’t know much about france but says that the classes are slowly helping him understand the country as well as the language.many of the volunteers at the jungle school are local teachers who are giving up their summer holidays.jenny flahaut, 33, who works at a children’s home, was inspired to volunteer after seeing an advertisement on facebook. “i saw these people in calais every day and i wanted to do something for them,” she said.she is particularly frustrated by the depiction of migrants in the media and by politicians who have never visited the camp, most recently david cameron, the british prime minister, who in a much criticized speech talked about “swarms” of people trying to reach the uk.“they don’t know them and have a bad vision but they are not like that,” flahaut said as she prepared for an afternoon lesson. “most of them are very good people. they are welcoming and friendly. they want to improve their life and make it better, and learning is part of that.”the teachers and zimarco are focused, now, on setting up a separate classroom to serve around 200 women and two dozen children. the women are outnumbered around ten to one by men in the calais encampment and most feel uncomfortable attending classes with male students they don’t know, the volunteers say.when that is finished, the former hotel worker whose work getting the school off the ground is remembered in its unofficial name – everyone in the camp just calls it “zimarco’s school” – has more dreams for making the camp a place to live, not just survive. he wants to set up a football team for migrants, he explains over an instant cappuccino in the immaculate tent he calls home, and even dreams of changing the camp name. he hates “the jungle” because he says it implies the residents aren’t people.“we have a discotheque, a house, a mosque, a school, shops,” he says. “we are not animals.”
advanced	they may not know who steve jobs was or even how to tie their own shoelaces, but the average six-year-old child understands more about digital technology than a 45-year-old adult, according to an authoritative new report.the advent of broadband in the year 2000 has created a generation of digital natives, ofcom (which checks standards in the uk communications industries) says in its annual study of british consumers. born in the new millennium, these children have never known the dark ages of dial-up internet and the youngest are learning how to operate smartphones or tablets before they are able to talk.òthese younger people are shaping communications,ó said jane rumble, ofcomõs media research head. òas a result of growing up in the digital age, they are developing fundamentally different communication habits from older generations, even compared to what we call the early adopters, the 16-to-24 age group.óofcom devised a òdigital quotientó, or dq, test to put 800 children and 2,000 adults through their paces, which, rather than measuring intelligence, as an iq test would, attempts to gauge awareness of and self-con dence around gadgets from tablets to smart watches, knowledge of superfast internet, 4g mobile- phone networks and mobile apps.among 6- to 7-year-olds, who have grown up with youtube, spotify music streaming and online television, the average dq score was 98, higher than for those aged between 45 and 49, who scored an average of 96. digital understanding peaks between 14 and 15 years of age, when the average is a dq of 113, and then drops gradually throughout adulthood, before falling rapidly in old age.people are now being invited to test their digital knowledge with an abbreviated version of the questionnaire that will give any member of the public a dq score, along with advice on how to improve their understanding and protect themselves and their families online.the ways in which millennial children contact each other and consume entertainment are so different from previous generations that forecasters now consider their preferences a better indication of the future than those of trendsetting young adults.the most remarkable change is in time spent talking on the phone. two decades ago, teenagers devoted their evenings to monopolizing the home telephone line, dissecting love affairs and friendships in conversations that lasted for hours.for those aged 12 to 15, phone calls account for just 3% of time spent communicating through any device. for all adults, this rises to 20% and, for young adults, it is still three times as high at 9%. todayõs children do the majority of their remote socializing by sending written messages or through shared photographs and videos. òthe millennium generation is losing its voice,ó ofcom claims.over 90% of their device-time is message based, chatting on social networks like facebook, sending instant messages through services like whatsapp or even  ring off traditional mobile- phone text messages. just 2% of childrenõs time is spent emailing, compared to 33% for adults.away from their phones, 12- to 15-year-olds have a very different relationship with other media, too. a digital seven-day diary shows live television accounts for just half of viewing for this age group, compared to nearly 70% for all adults. they spend 20% of their time viewing short video clips, for example on youtube, or news clips distributed via facebook and other social sites. the rest of their viewing is shared between dvds, streamed content through net ix or itunes and recorded television programmes.young adults aged 16 to 24 are voracious consumers of almost all media. however, live radio and print-based media have all but disappeared from their daily diet.younger people are moving away from live television and moving to streaming and catch- up services. even among adults, television is becoming less important. television viewing among 16- to 24-year-olds has been dipping each year since 2010, but 2013 was the  rst year where researchers found viewing fell across all age groups. the theory is that tablet computers ð among the most popular christmas presents in 2012 and 2013 ð have brought many older people online for longer. with large screens and simple, touch-based interfaces, tablets are being credited with a jump in internet access among the over-65s.òfor years, there has been a very stubborn resistance by the over-65s to accessing the internet,ó said james thickett, research director at ofcom. òin the last three years, we have seen that change and we think thatõs down to tablets.ó britain is embracing internet-enabled devices across the generations, to the extent that the balance between sleep and screen-based activities has now tipped. the typical adult spends eight hours and 41 minutes each day communicating or consuming media, including old-fashioned books and newspapers, and just eight hours and 21 minutes asleep.
advanced	not nearly enough exercise classes have a tea break halfway through. but margaret allen’s does. after a gentle warm-up and a few pulse-raising numbers, the 93-year-old great-grandmother lets her charges rehydrate with a cup of tea and a quick sit down.some of the eight-strong class look as if they need it more than others. allen herself, wearing a thick turquoise shirt, navy knitted waistcoat, black slacks and sensible shoes, has not broken into a sweat. despite an “excruciating” trapped nerve in one leg and a knee in need of replacement, she looks as though she could go on for hours.the general rule is that eating directly before sport is not the best idea, let alone part way through. but, on the afternoon i visit allen’s class at a church hall in saltburn-by-the-sea near middlesbrough, slices of fruitcake are being passed around during the break. the cake has been baked in honour of allen’s recent birthday by her 89-year-old sister, joan, known locally as the “scone queen of saltburn”.the ladies have barely swallowed their last crumb when allen is up again, leading the group through a jaunty scottish number involving lots of toe pointing and leg kicking. forty-five minutes later, the class is finally over.allen, a former volunteer with the red cross, has been leading classes in the north-east seaside town for 45 years. not particularly sporty at school, she started playing the piano for a keep-fit class during the second world war – “just for something to do during the blackouts, really” – and eventually took over in her 40s when the previous instructor retired.at its peak, allen’s class had more than 18 regulars, each paying £1 a time. but, these days, her flock is diminishing fast – during the teabreak, the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them had attended that week for one of the younger members of the group who had just died, aged 68, from motor neurone disease.allen is the oldest, followed by her sister. the baby of the group is 60-year-old jean cunion, who credits the group with supporting her through a difficult time when her mother died. she is somewhat embarrassed to admit that she is perhaps the least fit of the group. “i remember, the first time i came, margaret said: ‘who’s that huffing and panting?’ and i had to admit it was me.” ruth steere, 76, marvels at how allen never misses a trick, despite always having her back to the class: “she always shouts at us if we go wrong. she’s remarkably good at knowing what we are doing.”allen, a keen dancer, has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor. instead, she choreographs her own moves based on five tapes from the bbc’s first ever fitness guru, eileen fowler, who died in 2000 when she was 93, allen’s age now. allen thinks her good health is largely down to keeping busy, especially since her husband joe died in 1997. she took up writing poetry when she was 80.“i write poems about everything. i’m a prolific writer. i just can’t stop,” she says, phoning me a few days after the interview to read out a ditty she has written about the joys of exercise. one of the class, 84-year-old former teacher winnie robertson, thinks the secret to staying fit is never letting yourself go: “use it or lose it, that’s what i say.”allen still plays the piano and gives speeches. she is president of the women’s fellowship at the local methodist church and is one of three 90-plus year olds at the scrabble club of the university of the third age. she did a computer course when she was 88 and tried to get online, but it didn’t work out.ageing is no fun, she admits, reading me a few lines from a poem she has written called ‘that beast called age’. she happily recalls a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years back, who said she couldn’t possibly be more than 78: “i said, ‘thank you, doctor. you can go now.’”she also has a no-nonsense attitude to weight gain: “i just think people shouldn’t eat too much. whenever i hear someone saying, ‘oh, i can’t lose weight’, i say: ‘sellotape.’” she mimes taping her mouth shut. “i said this just the other day to a big fat man. everything in moderation is my motto.”earlier in 2013, allen was watching the news and saw a woman being given the british empire medal. i think she means margaret chartwood from horley, who was given the honour in january, at the age of 77. “she was saying: ‘i’m 80 and i’m the oldest fitness instructor in the country!’ i was thinking: ‘no, you’re not.’ but i shan’t be writing to buckingham palace.”
