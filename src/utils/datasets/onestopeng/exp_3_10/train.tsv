intermediate	male bosses are paid bonuses double the size of those given to female colleagues in identical jobs. this means that men get salary top-ups of £141,500 more than women over their working lives.the figures, released by the chartered management institute (cmi), reveal that men in uk management roles earned average bonuses of £6,442 in 2012 compared with £3,029 for women.in the most senior roles, female directors received bonuses of £36,270 over the past 12 months, compared with £63,700 awarded to male directors.the latest figures show that pay in british business is still not equal. this has led to calls for action from campaigners on workplace equality.ann francke, the cmi’s chief executive said: “it’s time to move this issue into the mainstream management agenda.“this is about changing our approach to management. there should be greater flexibility, less masculine cultures, more emphasis on outcomes rather than time in the office and greater transparency around performance and rewards.“in solving this issue, we would actually raise the performance of organizations and the well-being of individuals at work. what are we waiting for?”while some of the data may be affected by factors such as women doing jobs where there is less of a culture of bonus payments, the differences in the sizes of bonuses do appear to make britain’s pay gap worse. the government says the pay gap is closing but that full-time male employees still earn 10% more than women.maria miller, the minister for women and equalities, said: “the cmi figures are another example from the world of work showing that women still lose out to their male counterparts.“changes in the workplace are happening and it’s good that the pay gap is closing – but there is still more to do before we see full equality in the workplace.“the government is playing its part. we have signed up 120 companies to our think, act, report scheme, which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit, promote and pay women.“we’ve also looked at other pay gap causes, such as having to juggle work and family responsibilities. we have introduced shared parental leave and the right to request flexible working to all employees.”large companies such as tesco, bt, unilever and the international law firm eversheds are among those signed up to think, act, report. the scheme has only attracted 120 supporters in nearly two years of existence.however, the cmi’s data did provide some evidence to support miller’s statement that the overall pay gap is narrowing: the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses appeared to shrink from 2012.a sub-set of 17,000 individual managers, whose salaries and bonuses have been followed over a number of years, showed that male managers’ earnings are rising faster than women’s for the first time in five years. men’s earnings increased by 3.2% compared with a 2.8% increase for women, when salaries and bonuses are combined.at the most senior level, male directors’ earnings rose by 5.3% over the past 12 months, compared with just 1.1% for female directors.nannan
intermediate	an extraordinary press conference at leicester university has revealed the identity of the man in the car park with the twisted spine. it has also revealed his appalling last moments and the humiliating treatment of his body in the hours after his death. there were cheers when richard buckley, leader of the team of archaeologists, finally announced that they were certain they had found the body of richard iii.the evidence was overwhelming. the scientists who carried out the dna tests, those who created the computer-imaging technology to examine the bones in extraordinary detail, the genealogists who found a distant descendant with matching dna, and the academics who investigated contemporary texts for accounts of the king’s death and burial all reported their findings.work has started on designing a new tomb in leicester cathedral, only 100 yards from the excavation site, and a ceremony will be held to lay him into his new grave there, probably next year. leicester’s museums’ service is working on plans for a new visitor centre in an old school building overlooking the site.richard died at bosworth on 22 august 1485, the last english king to die in battle, and, for the first time, the researchers revealed how. there was an intake of breath as a picture showed the base of his skull sliced off by one terrible hit, probably from a razor-sharp iron axe blade on a wooden pole. the blade probably went several centimetres into his brain and, experts say, he was certainly unconscious at once and dead almost as soon.the injury confirms the story that he died in the middle of the battle and without his horse – as in his cry in shakespeare’s play: “a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!” another cut from a sword, which also went through the bone and into the brain, would also have been fatal. but many of the other injuries were after death, suggesting that the king’s naked body was mutilated as it was brought back to leicester.one terrible injury was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour. it suggests the story that his naked body was brought back on a horse and humiliated all the way is true. bob savage, a medieval weapons expert, said it was probably not a war weapon but the sort of sharp knife or dagger any workman might have carried.michael ibsen, the canadian-born furniture maker proved to be the descendant of richard’s sister, heard the confirmation on sunday and listened to the evidence in shocked silence. “my head is no clearer now than when i first heard the news,” he said. “many, many hundreds of people died on that field that day. he was a king, but just one of the dead. he lived in very violent times and these deaths would not have been pretty or quick.”it was mathew morris who first uncovered the body, in the first hour of the first day of the excavation. he did not believe he had found the king. the mechanical digger was still removing the tarmac from the car park, a place identified by years of research by local historians and the richard iii society as the probable site of the lost church of grey friars. the priests of grey friars bravely took the body of the king and buried him in a hastily dug grave, probably still naked, but in a position of honour near the high altar of their church. the leg bones, which were just showing through the soil, were covered up again.ten days later, on 5 september, when further excavation proved morris had hit the crucial spot, he returned with lin foxhall, head of the archaeology department, to excavate the body. “we did it the usual way, lifting the arms, legs and skull first, and proceeding gradually towards the torso – so it was only when we finally saw the twisted spine that i thought: ‘my word, i think we’ve got him.’”for philippa langley of the richard iii society, richard was the true king, the last king of the north, a brave leader who became a victim of some of the most brilliant propaganda in history, in the hands of shakespeare. there remains the dark shadow of the little princes in the tower, an infamous story even in richard’s day: the child edward v and his brother richard were declared illegitimate when richard iii claimed the throne, imprisoned in the tower of london and never seen alive again. although it is not certain that the bones found at the tower centuries later are theirs, there may be more dna detective work to be done there.nannan
intermediate	at addis ababa airport, visitors are greeted by pictures of golden grains, tiny red seeds and a group of men around a giant pancake. the words say: “teff: the ultimate gluten-free crop!”ethiopia is one of the world’s poorest countries, well known for its difficult food situation. but it is also the home of teff, a highly nutritious ancient grain that is now being sold in health-food shops and supermarkets in europe and america.teff’s tiny seeds – the size of poppy seeds – are high in calcium, iron and protein, and also amino acids. naturally gluten free, the grain can be used instead of wheat flour in anything from bread and pasta to waffles and pizza bases. like quinoa, the andean grain, teff’s superb nutritional profile offers the promise of new and lucrative markets in the west.in ethiopia, teff is a national obsession. grown by around 6.3 million farmers, fields of the crop cover more than 20% of all farmland. it is ground into flour and used to make injera, the flatbread that is basic to ethiopian cooking. the grain is also central to many religious and cultural ceremonies. across the country, and in neighbouring eritrea, people gather around large pieces of injera, which is also used as cutlery, scooping up stews and feeding one another as a sign of loyalty or friendship – a tradition known as gursha.the growing appetite for traditional crops and the booming health-food and gluten-free markets are breathing new life into the grain, which is increasingly being called ethiopia’s “second gift to the world”, after coffee.sophie kebede, a london-based businesswoman who owns a uk company specializing in the grain, says she was “flabbergasted” when she discovered its nutritional value. “i didn’t know it was so sought after. i am of ethiopian origin; i’ve been eating injera all my life.”growing demand for so-called ancient grains has not always been a simple positive for poor communities. in bolivia and peru, there are reports of rising incomes from the now-global quinoa trade, but also malnutrition and conflicts over land, as farmers sell their entire crop to meet western demand.ethiopia’s growing middle class is also increasing demand for teff and rising prices have made the grain too expensive for the poorest people. today, most small farmers sell most of what they grow to people in the city.this may have helped boost incomes in some rural areas but it has had nutritional consequences, says the government, as teff is the most nutritionally valuable grain in the country. in urban areas, people eat up to 61kg of teff a year. in rural areas, the figure is 20kg. the type of teff people eat is different, too: the rich eat the more expensive magna and white teff varieties; poorer people usually eat less-valuable red and mixed teff and more than half combine it with cheaper cereals such as sorghum and maize.the ethiopian government wants to double teff production by 2015. it says that the grain could play an important role in school meals and emergency aid programmes, and help reduce malnutrition – particularly among children and adolescents.though ethiopia has a fast-growing economy, it remains on the un’s list of least-developed countries. an estimated 20% of under-fives are malnourished.the government’s agricultural transformation agency aims to boost crops by developing improved varieties of the grain and introducing new planting techniques and tools.the government does not allow the export of raw teff grain, only of injera and other processed products. but this could change: the goal is to produce enough teff for ethiopia and for export.mama fresh is a family company that has been selling injera to top restaurants and hotels in the ethiopian capital for years. it also exports the flatbread to finland, germany, sweden and the us, mostly for ethiopians who live there. but, the company wants to double exports to america in 2014 and will soon start producing teff-based pizzas, bread and cookies.regassa feyissa, an ethiopian agricultural scientist and former head of the national institute for biodiversity, warns that, without careful planning, increased teff production for export may mean that farmers do not grow other important crops.with not much ethiopian teff on the international market, farmers in the us have started planting the crop. farmers in europe, israel and australia have also experimented with it.nannan
intermediate	cathal redmond was swimming off the greek coast and he was sure he had taken some great photos of colourful  sh with his  rst underwater camera. but, when he looked at the results later, the photos were brown and murky. he took the pictures while holding his breath underwater and blamed the limited time he had to set up the shots. all he needed, he thought, was a little more time to photograph the  sh in their natural environment.he decided to invent something to make that little extra time a reality and the result is his invention of the express dive ð a re llable air storage device, which is held in the mouth and lets people swim underwater for two minutes. it bridges the gap between snorkelling, with its limitations, and scuba diving, which gives divers the freedom to breathe underwater but requires heavy and expensive gear. the prototype of the invention looks like a combination of a scuba mouthpiece and a water bottle.òi wanted to enable people to do more. so, rather than just go underwater and spend 30 seconds holding their breath, i wanted people to do a little bit more,ó says redmond, 27. in 2006, the irish designer completed a scuba-diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and observe  sh in their natural environment. less enjoyable, however, was all the equipment he neededòi was very aware of the fact that i had about 50kg of equipment on me and going under the water felt strange when you are used to trying to keep yourself at the surface. it was a very surreal experience,ó he says. òthe real problem is that scuba diving is very limiting. although it allows you to stay underwater for longer, you have to plan your whole day around it. you have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you ð you canõt be walking on the beach and decide you want to go in. planning is a very big part of it.óit was during a  nal-year project for his product design degree that redmond produced the express dive. the device has two main parts. when above the surface, the unit sucks in air through a vent in the mouthpiece. the air is compressed through valves and stored in the tank. the tank has a light that  ashes green when it is full. when air is no longer being taken in, the vent shuts off and, as the person dives, air is fed back via the mouthpiece.the light turns from green to red when the air start to run out. the device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to re ll. òwhen you put the compressor into the unit with all of the rest of the stuff, the batteries and the electronics, the dif cult thing was to make it small enough so that people could hold it in their mouths,ó redmond says.redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to using a snorkel. he compares it to an extension of the lungs in that the user is taking a deep breath and then using it underwater. òit is an extension of the bodyõs ability to store air,ó he says. the prototype has been tested in parts. redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutesõ worth of air into the unit and that the design can be held in the diverõs mouth.what he has not yet done is test the device on a diver, fully submerged for two minutes. but, with enough testing, redmond is con dent he can get a fully working device that will not endanger swimmers underwater. the device will probably cost £280, he says, and it is likely to weigh from 1kg to 3kg depending on the safety features needed.to anyone who thinks two minutes of air is no more than a very small improvement on snorkelling, redmond says it could make a big difference underwater. the typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater, he says. òtwo minutes is not a lot of time but it is a lot longer than that,ó he says.nan
intermediate	according to a new census, there are more tigers in nepal than at any time since the 1970s. this has given conservationists hope that the big cats, whose numbers have been dropping across south asia for 100 years, can be saved.the number of wild royal bengal tigers in nepal has increased to 198 – a 63.6% rise in five years – the government survey showed. “this is very good news,” said maheshwar dhakal, an ecologist with nepal’s department of national parks and wildlife conservation.the census is based on the examination of pictures from more than 500 cameras in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors. more than 250 conservationists and wildlife experts worked on the survey, which cost about £250,000. dhakal said that a similar survey was done in india and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013. “it will take a few more months for india, which now has 1,300 big cats in several huge protected areas, to finish the survey,” he added. nepal has promised to double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 when the last systematic tiger count took place.increasing wealth in asia has led to higher prices for tiger skins and the body parts used in traditional chinese medicines. international gangs pay poor local nepali large amounts of money to kill the cats. the skin and bones are given to middlemen, who pass easily through the border with india, where the major dealers are based.one major problem is that some senior officials help mafia networks involved in the trade. conservation experts believe that the increase in tiger numbers is the result of better policing of national parks and better management of tiger habitats in nepal, where forests cover 29% of the land. but they say nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers feed so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat.as the number of tigers has increased over the years, conflict with villagers has increased, too. seven people were killed in attacks by tigers around national parks in 2012 compared to four in 2011, park officials said. villagers also want better protection. “the government is making conservation plans for tigers. but it should also produce plans to protect people from tigers,” krishna bhurtel, a village headman, told a nepali newspaper. wildlife authorities captured a tiger after it killed two people, including a villager who was pulled from his bed in may.thousands of tigers once roamed the forests in bangladesh, india and nepal. but their numbers have dropped to about 3,000, a 95% drop over a century. chitwan national park in central nepal has the highest number of adult tigers, with 120, followed by bardiya national park (50) and shukla phanta wildlife reserve (17).diwakar chapagain, head of a world wildlife fund nepal unit that monitors wildlife trade, said tiger skins were in demand in tibet, where rich people use them as festival costumes.in nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins for special occasions. some wealthy nepali have tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms. tiger bones are used in traditional chinese medicines. “the trade in tiger parts is lucrative and fetches thousands of dollars in illegal markets,” chapagain said.
intermediate	himalayan lakes, spacewalks and the us presidential campaign helped scott kelly stay sane during his 340 days in space, the astronaut told journalists after he landed back on earth from a record-breaking mission. òit seemed like i lived there forever,ó kelly said. he had been on several previous missions but said that his biggest surprise was simply how long this one felt. òmaybe, occasionally, you do go bananas,ó he said.kelly and a russian colleague, mikhail kornienko, spent nearly a year on the international space station (iss) in order to study the effects of weightlessness, radiation and the cramped conditions of space ight on humans. nasa considers this research essential for a future mission to mars.kelly said the length of the mission was its biggest challenge and that he felt much more sore when he returned to gravity than after shorter trips. kelly and his twin brother, mark, a retired astronaut, have spent the last year taking physical and mental tests. the tests will continue, to help nasa learn about how the body copes with the severe strains of space ight.he said the discomfort of returning to gravity took nothing from the sense of wonder he felt after he landed back on earth. when the russian capsule opened on to the cool air of kazakhstan, kelly said, he smelled òa fragrance like a plant was blooming in that areaó. it was the fresh air mixed with the charred, òkind of sweetó smell of a spacecraft that had survived re-entry through the atmosphere.as he left the spacecraft, he said, the importance of the mission began to sink in: 340 days on a 15-year- old space station which is òa million pounds, the size of a football  eld, the internal volume, some say, of a six-bedroom houseó. the iss, he said, is a place that uses the power of the sun and was built with the help of an international team.òthere are things weõre going to discover about our experience in space in the space station that we donõt even know now,ó kelly said, comparing the research of more than 450 missions there to the work done by computer scientists at nasa in the 1960s and 1970s. he added: òthe view is great, too.ókelly made the most of that view ð he posted spectacular photos on social media of the earthõs cities, landscapes, oceans and atmosphere. òthe earth is a beautiful planet,ó he said, describing the beautiful waters around the bahamas and the rainbow colours of the lakes of the northern himalayas. he said he would like to visit that region, though he would  rst need to learn òwhat country actually owns themó. but, òmainly, you just notice how thin the atmosphere is,ó kelly added. òthat, together with these large areas of pollution, is kind of alarming.óthe astronaut said he could see entire systems of pollution: smoke clouds from wild res that covered parts of the us, sections of asia with continuous, visible pollution nearly all year round. he said the message òwe need to save the planetó wasnõt completely correct: òthe planet will get better; itõs us that wonõt be here because weõll destroy the environment.ó the worldõs thin shield of atmosphere òmakes you more of an environmentalist after spending so much time looking downó, he said.òitõs for us to take care of the air we breathe and the water we drink. and i do believe we have an impact on that and we do have the ability to change it, if we make the decision to.ó kelly was very active on social media, which made many people follow him online. but he said he was unaware of it. instead, he watched the drama of the 2016 us presidential election.besides the news, he said, steady work helped keep him sane: òi tried to have milestones that were close, like when is the next crew arriving, the next spacewalk, the next science experiment. that made a difference to me ð it kept my sanity.ó being back on earth with the rest of humanity had not quite sunk in, he added. he recalled how shocked he had been to see a crowd of people after a previous mission. òiõll soon start feeling that kind of culture shock,ó he said.kelly predicted that he would not  y again with nasa. òbut i donõt think i would ever say iõm absolutely, 100%  nished,ó he added, because of the sudden successes of private space ight companies such as spacex. òthey might need a guy like me someday,ó he said. òmaybe, in the next 20 years, youõll be able to buy a cheap ticket, just go for a little visit.ónannan
intermediate	for 85 years, it was just a grey blob on classroom maps of the solar system. but, on 15 july, pluto was seen in high resolution for the first time. the images show dramatic mountain ranges made from solid water ice as big as the alps or the rockies.the extraordinary images of the former ninth planet and its large moon, charon, were sent back 4bn miles to earth from the new horizons spacecraft. they are the climax of a mission that has been quietly underway for nearly ten years.alan stern, the mission’s principal investigator, said “new horizons is returning amazing results. the data look absolutely gorgeous, and pluto and charon are just mind-blowing.”one of the biggest surprises was the discovery that “there are mountains in the kuiper belt”, the solar system’s mysterious “third zone” where pluto is, with about 100,000 smaller icy objects. john spencer, a mission scientist, said the mountains appear to be around 3,000 metres high and several hundred miles across.the detailed image of one edge of the dwarf planet showed not a single crater. this tells scientists that there has been recent geological activity on the surface, which could include dramatic geysers throwing ice into the atmosphere or cryo-volcanoes that erupt in explosions of ice.pluto used to be the ninth planet but, since 2006, it has been known as a dwarf planet. the nasa press conference began with spectacular images of the sun and the eight official planets. “we’ve brought what was previously a blurred point of light into focus,” said dwayne brown, nasa spokesman, as scientists and journalists waited for the image to be shown.stern said that there would be many more images and that we would learn a lot more about the planet during the coming year. the images have already produced some surprises. scientists believe the mountains are made from water ice with just a thin cover of “exotic” ices, methane and nitrogen.“water ice is strong enough to hold up big mountains and that’s what we think we can see here. this is the first time we’ve seen this. the methane and nitrogen are just a coating.” the mountains on pluto probably formed no more than 100m years ago – extremely recently in the 4.56bn-year-old solar system. this suggests the region, which covers about 1% of pluto’s surface, may still be geologically active. the images are the first to show ice mountains, except those found on the moons of giant planets.the images are so detailed that, if the craft were flying over london, we would be able to see the runways at heathrow airport.the distance to pluto – 5bn km – means it takes new horizons hours to send back a picture and it will take 16 months to send back all the data. the team also announced that the heart-shaped feature visible on pluto will now be known as the tombaugh regio, after clyde tombaugh, who discovered the dwarf planet in 1930.the new view of charon reveals an area of cliffs stretching about 1,000km. this suggests cracks in charon’s surface, which could also be the result of geological activity. the image also shows a dramatic canyon about 7 to 9km deep.cathy olkin, a mission scientist, said: “charon just blew our socks off when we saw the new image today. the team has just been abuzz. there is so much interesting science in this one image alone.” scientists think that pluto is two thirds rock surrounded by a lot of ice, with surface temperatures of about minus 230c. as the £460m mission continues into the kuiper belt, scientists hope that it will help us to see and understand more of the ancient solar system and the origins of planets. it may even help to explain the formation of the earth itself.andrew coates, head of planetary science at the mullard space science laboratory, said: “these kuiper belt objects are the building blocks of the outer solar system. they’re all very cold – it’s like a cosmic deep freeze. it’s the best way of preserving solar system history. that is what is so fascinating about this. it’s a really thrilling time for solar system exploration.”in august 2015, mission scientists will choose which of two objects to visit next. nasa estimates that the spacecraft will be able to keep recording and sending back data until the mid-2030s. then, its plutonium power source will run out and it will drift outwards towards the edge of the solar system and deep space.new horizons also observed the smaller members of the pluto system, which includes four other moons: nix, hydra, styx and kerberos. “new horizons is a true mission of exploration, showing us why basic scientific research is so important,” said john grunsfeld, associate administrator for nasa’s science mission directorate.the images also suggest that hydra’s surface is probably coated with water ice. future images will reveal more clues about the formation of this, and the other moon, billions of years ago.”nan
intermediate	two mothers in south africa have found out that they are raising each otherõs daughters after they were mistakenly switched at birth in a hospital in 2010.but, while one of the women wants to correct the error and get her biological child back, the other is refusing to give back the girl she has raised as her own.henk strydom, a lawyer for one of the mothers, described the swap as a travesty and tragedy that is unlikely to have a happy ending.both mothers gave birth at the tambo memorial hospital in boksburg, east of johannesburg, on the same day in 2010. ònobody suspected anything,ó strydom said.but, in 2013, one of the mothers, who is 33 and unemployed, sued her ex-partner for maintenance for her daughter. strydom said: òthe man denied he was the father. a dna test was done and it was found it was not his baby and not her baby. she was devastated. she didnõt know what to do.óeventually, she met the other mother and, since december 2013, they have been attending joint counselling sessions, arranged by the hospital. here they have met their biological daughtersstrydom said of his client: òshe said there are resemblances to herself. she told me that it was traumatic. you can see itõs not easy for her. she has to care for a child that is not hers on her own while her child is with someone else.óthe woman became unhappy with the process and asked the childrenõs court to give her custody of her biological child, but the other mother refused.òitõs a tragedy. she wants the baby back, but itõs four years later: you can understand that the other mother doesnõt want to give up her baby,ó strydom said.the high court in pretoria has asked the university of pretoriaõs centre for child law to investigate what will now be in the best interests of the children.strydom added: òi donõt know what the court will decide. your guess is as good as mine. but, whatever happens, someone wonõt be happy.óhe said, at this point, he and his client do not want to sue the hospital or government health department, which is helping with the case and providing counselling.the centre for child law will interview the mothers and fathers, as well as any other person with a òsignificant relationshipó with either of the girls. the children and mothers will have clinical assessments and may be seen by a psychologist.karabo ngidi, a lawyer with the centre, said: òwhatõs going to happen must be in the best interests of the children. biology is an important aspect but not the only one.ó the families are of zulu ethnicity and so zulu tradition, culture and customary law will be a factor, she added. it is also still possible the ex- partner of the mother who is taking legal action could be the biological father of the girl who was switched.it is not the first child-swap case in south africa. in 1995, two mothers were awarded damages after their sons, born in 1989, were accidentally switched at the johannesburg hospital where they were born.in 2009, in oregon in the united states, dee ann angell and kay rene reed discovered that they had been mistakenly mixed up at birth in 1953 when a nurse brought them back from bathing.in 2013, in japan, a 60-year-old man swapped at birth from his rich parents to a poor family was given compensation. he grew up on welfare and became a truck driver, whereas his biological brothers and sisters ð and the boy brought up in his place ð attended private secondary schools and universities.bruce laing, a clinical psychologist in johannesburg, said the long-term effects of a baby swap could be òprofoundó, òterrifyingó and òincredibly traumatizingó. he told the times of south africa: òthe parents might always be thinking ôwhat if?õó
intermediate	it was a beautiful summer evening and i decided to go for a swim off doolin pier in county clare, ireland, where i moved in 2012. there was a woman in the water with dusty, a dolphin who has a great relationship with a group of people she regularly swims with. dusty arrived in doolin in about 2008 and hundreds of people have swum with her since, giving the impression that she’s totally tame.that evening, the woman was tickling dusty’s tummy and it just looked so inviting. there were about 20 tourists and locals on the pier, looking at this lovely spectacle. just after i got into the water, dusty left the woman she was with and went crazy – i found out afterwards that she’s very territorial when she is with somebody. her tail was flapping wildly and, at first, i thought it was a display but, then, i realized she was angry. i knew i had to get out of the water so i swam towards the pier but, within seconds, dusty had crashed into me with her snout. it was very powerful and painful, and the speed was amazing. i was pushed forwards violently.all the people on the pier were staring down at me open-mouthed. dusty was still in the water beside me, her tail flapping crazily. that was more frightening than anything: i thought, if she hits me with her tail, i could go under and drown.i was at the pier but couldn’t get out because of my injuries. i felt pure terror. i shouted for help and a guy put his arm in and pulled me out on to the steps. then, another man appeared and said he was an orthopaedic surgeon. he had been driving into doolin when he saw what was happening on the pier. i was so cold and very worried – i didn’t know how bad my injuries were and my biggest fear was internal bleeding. he checked me over and said he couldn’t feel any evidence of bleeding but that i probably had broken bones. i found out later that i had six spinal fractures, three broken ribs and a damaged lung.i was in hospital for five days and off work for five months with limited mobility and pain. then, i was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress. my near-death experience had left me anxious about everything. i felt that people were looking at me in the wrong way, i began to struggle with loud noises and i suffered from memory loss. three months before the accident, i had opened a health-food shop but i had to let it go because i could no longer work.it was the hardest year ever but, now, it’s all behind me. i had therapy, osteopathy and massage, and am building up my own osteopathy practice now. i have a new empathy with patients because i have been one.i am grateful that i am healthy and i really want to prevent other people being injured. we have this lovely idea about dolphins and have faith in them – who would think a dolphin would ever attack a person? if you see a fierce animal coming towards you with its teeth bared, it’s scary, but dolphins have this lovely, wide smile.i don’t have any anger towards dusty. i respect her. but i was in her territory and she’s a wild, unpredictable animal. people need to know that. so many come here to swim with her and they don’t understand how dangerous it can be. several other people were injured that summer.after the man pulled me out of the water, dusty swam away but, then, she came back and was looking at me. our eyes met and i felt there was complete remorse in her. she was a totally different dolphin; the anger had gone. the people on the pier were in awe. when she had that little moment with me, that was the end of the terror. i made my peace with her.
intermediate	prince harry has flown out of afghanistan at the end of a four-month tour. during his time there he admitted killing insurgents while flying his apache helicopter. he spoke about the frustrations of being a royal who wishes for a life out of the spotlight.he also told of his disdain for and distrust of some sections of the media and described how his father constantly reminded him to behave more like a member of the royal family.a commander of the army’s most sophisticated attack helicopter, the prince said he had shot at the taliban during operations to support ground troops and rescue injured afghan and nato personnel. he said he was only doing his job.in a series of interviews during his time based at camp bastion in helmand province, he hinted at the difficulty of reconciling the different roles in his life. the prince, known as captain wales in the army, explained his ‘three mes’. “one in the army, one socially in my own private time and one with the family.”he admitted he sometimes ‘let himself down’ with his laddish behaviour, which he said was probably because he is “too much army and not enough prince”, but he said he was entitled to privacy, too.in another interview, he criticized the media, especially the sun, the daily mail and the daily telegraph, three of the royal family’s strongest supporters. he said he was particularly annoyed by articles comparing his role as an apache co-pilot gunner to spitfire crews during the second world war. “no, it’s not like that at all,” he said.the prince said his suspicion of the media came from the treatment of his family when “i was very small”, but that he couldn’t stop reading the stories written about him. “of course i read them,” the prince said. “if there’s a story and something’s been written about me, i want to know what’s being said. but all it does is just upset me and anger me that people can get away with writing the stuff they do. not just about me, but about everything and everybody. my father always says, ‘don’t read it’. everyone says, ‘don’t read it, because it’s always rubbish’.”four years ago, the prince had to be taken out of afghanistan during his first tour after a media silence was broken by mistake by an australian magazine. this time, the ministry of defence chose to publicize his deployment on the understanding that newspapers and broadcasters would not give a running commentary on his life out there to allow him to do his job. two-man crews from the bbc, sky and itn were sent once each to report on his visit.when he was asked whether he felt more comfortable being captain wales than prince harry, his reply was one of the most revealing he has given about his relationship with prince charles. “definitely. i’ve always been like that. my father’s always trying to remind me about who i am and stuff like that. but it’s very easy to forget about who i am when i am in the army. everyone’s wearing the same uniform and doing the same kind of thing. i get on well with the lads and i enjoy my job. it really is as simple as that.”shortly before he went to afghanistan, the prince was photographed naked in las vegas during a private party. harry said he had let himself down, but also blamed the media. “i probably let myself down, i let my family down, i let other people down. but, at the end of the day, i was in a private area and there should be a certain amount of privacy that one should expect.”when he was asked where he and his brother’s fascination with helicopters came from, he said, “probably the fact that you can only fit a certain number of people in a helicopter, therefore no one can follow us, like you guys.”nannan
elementary	police and intelligence agencies around the world have, for almost 100 years, used the polygraph, a lie-detector test, to help catch criminals and spies.but, now, researchers in britain and the netherlands have developed a new method, which is correct (in tests) over 70% of the time. police stations around the world might begin using this new method within ten years. it doesn’t monitor movements in the face, talking too much or waving arms – all signs that someone is lying. the new method monitors movements in the whole body, which can show that the person is feeling guilty.the polygraph is often used in the us in criminal cases and by the fbi and cia but is much less popular in europe. many people do not believe that it is reliable.the basic idea behind the new method is that liars fidget more and that an all-body motion suit – the kind used in films to create computer-generated characters – will record this.the new method is over 70% reliable – the polygraph is only 55% reliable. in some tests, the success rate of the new method was more than 80%.ross anderson, one of the research team, said: “guilty people fidget more and we can now measure this.”the polygraph was created in 1921 by policeman john larson. it records changes in pulse, blood pressure, sweating and breathing to find out if someone is lying.in movies, the polygraph is always correct but, in 1998, the us supreme court decided that there was no agreement that the polygraph was reliable. the us national academy of scientists said the same thing in 2003.the tests anderson and his colleagues did involved 180 students and employees at lancaster university. half of the people were told to tell the truth and half to lie.the researchers interviewed some of the people about a computer game called never end that they played for seven minutes. others lied about playing it.the second test involved a lost wallet with £5 inside. some people had to bring the wallet to a lost-and-found box. others hid it and lied about it.the new body-suit method was correct 82.2% of the time. researchers monitored how much the people moved their arms and legs, to decide if they were telling the truth or lying.all-body suits are expensive – they cost about £30,000 – and they can be uncomfortable, so anderson and his colleagues are now looking at cheaper alternatives. these include using motion-sensing technology from computer games, such as the kinect devices developed by microsoft for the xbox console.nannannannannannannannannan
elementary	an international agreement to improve safety in bangladesh’s clothes factories could face legal action. this is because factory owners are asking for compensation for the cost of closures and repair work. some repairs may take months and factory owners say they cannot pay workers while factories are closed. also, they cannot pay for big works to make buildings safe. the building repairs are happening after the rana plaza building in the capital of bangladesh, dhaka, collapsed in 2013 and 1,138 people died.the problems come as hundreds of bangladeshi clothes factories are inspected every month for fire-safety and structural problems under the accord on fire and building safety in bangladesh. the accord is supported by over 170 international companies, including primark and marks & spencer, and international trade unions, including industriall.the owner of one dhaka factory, softex cotton, said he will take legal action against the accord because his factory was closed down as a result of structural problems. he wants around $100 million in compensation.another factory owner said that, when a factory closed, even for a few months, it would lose orders and close permanently: “there is no such thing as temporary closure,” he said. the factory owner said it was not clear in the accord agreement who would pay for factory closures.jenny holdcroft, policy director for industriall, which has been closely involved in the accord, said that the agreement made sure that factories would not lose orders during closure because companies agreed to continue orders with suppliers for two years.the accord has found12 factories that need a lot of work, but holdcroft said many of those only needed partial closure and production could continue on other floors. the accord also asks companies to make sure that workers receive pay during factory closures. she said that factory owners who could afford to pay for repairs and compensation for workers should make the payments.“companies don’t want to pay so that rich factory owners can continue to just take the profits and not spend on their factories for years. it is not surprising that there is disruption. if there was no disruption, there would be no change,” she said. a spokesman for the accord said negotiations over payments and even legal action would not delay its work to improve safety in factories.but there is now more pressure on the accord to help pay workers when their factories close. a rival factory-safety group, supported by us retailers including walmart and gap, the alliance for bangladesh worker safety, has given $5 million to help pay factory workers for up to two months while buildings are improved.“the alliance is sharing the workers’ salary with factory owners so now there is a big confusion. we had a big meeting with the accord to make them understand they have to help or how will we help our workers?” said shaidullah azim, a director of the bangladeshi garment manufacturers and exporters association.
elementary	a fifth of young adults in the uk are staying in the family home until they are at least 26 and a fifth are not paying any rent. a recent survey found that the percentage of adults who live at home was different in different parts of the country – it was less than 9% in the east midlands and more than double that in london, where house prices and rents are highest. many young people pay their parents some money to live at home but 20% pay nothing at all.young adults are suffering from low wages and high rents. the cost of renting is too much so young people who want to buy a house can’t save enough to get on the property ladder. recent research showed half of tenants were unable to save any money for a deposit and a quarter could only save £100 or less each month. mortgages are cheaper than ever before but people who have large deposits still get the best mortgages.as a result of this, more and more young adults are returning to the family home to save money. and, parents who cannot afford to give their children money for a deposit seem happy to let them live at home again. the survey found that 28% of adults live at home because they are trying to save for a deposit. but it also found that 30% are not saving any money.michael day, 30, who lives with his parents in bristol, says it’s difficult to save for a mortgage deposit when rents are so high. rents for a onebedroom home in the city are between £500 and £800 a month. buying a similar flat would cost about £130,000. “i don’t really want to move out to rent because it’s more than a mortgage but you need such a big deposit to get a mortgage.”sue green, who works for saga, a business that sells insurance to people over 50, said most parents did not think their children would live with them in their 20s or 30s. “most will be more than happy to have them in the family home rent-free because it might help their kids get on the property ladder sooner,” she said. “children who don’t pay rent may pay for other things like groceries or they may do odd jobs around the home.”angus hanton, of the intergenerational foundation, said older people caused the housing crisis and we should not blame younger people for staying at home. “the under-30s earn, on average, 20% less since the 2008 downturn. rents and car insurance have never been so high,” he said, “and many jobs – zero-hour and short-term contracts – turn younger workers into second-class citizens.”jenna gavin, 29, lives in the family home where she grew up. she works as a medical receptionist nearby so she wants to stay in the area. but renting a one-bedroom flat would cost more than £420 a month not including bills, which would use a lot of her earnings. “i don’t want to rent – i don’t want to spend all that money and have nothing at the end,” she said. “i’ve thought about buying and seen mortgage advisers but i just can’t borrow enough to get on the property ladder.”she is trying to save for a deposit. “it’s difficult to save enough money – even a 5% deposit is such a lot of money,” she said. her parents are happy not to ask her to pay rent. “they want me to try to save and i do other things – i buy food and i do things around the house.” she gets on with her parents and has the same room that she had when she was 14 but she said she had always imagined she would have her own home before she was 30.nannannan
elementary	swiss police recently entered the baur au lac hotel in zurich at dawn and arrested 16 football officials, including five current or former fifa executives. they were later charged with corruption in the us. the officials included the former brazilian federation chief ricardo teixeira and his successor, marco polo del nero.they were among 16 individuals accused of fraud and other crimes by the us department of justice. the us has now charged 27 defendants, including former fifa executives. “the level of corruption is completely unacceptable,” said the us attorney general, loretta lynch.swiss police arrested the president of the south american football confederation, the paraguayan juan ángel napout, and alfredo hawit, the head of the north and central american and caribbean governing body. hawit started his job after jeffrey webb left the job in may 2015 because he was arrested. this was part of the us operation that led to a crisis at fifa and caused sepp blatter to lose his job and reputation.the swiss federal office of justice said of the latest arrests: “they are in custody before their extradition. the us believes they accepted bribes of millions of dollars”. webb and the colombian former executive luis bedoya entered guilty pleas in the us.eleven current and former fifa executives have now been charged in the investigation, which alleges $200m in bribes, mainly from tv and marketing contracts but also fifa’s development programmes.“the message from this announcement should be clear to everyone who hopes to escape our investigation: you will not escape,” said lynch. teixeira, the former son-in-law of the fifa ex-president joão havelange, was charged together with del nero and his predecessor josé maria marin, who was charged in may 2015.fourteen men were charged in may 2015. days later, blatter won a fifth term as president but then agreed to leave his job as the crisis grew. he was then suspended together with the uefa president, michel platini, because of an alleged £1.3m payment to the frenchman. both men might get life bans when the fifa ethics committee hears their case in december if they are found guilty.among those also charged on thursday were rafael salguero, a guatemalan who left the executive committee in may; the former south american confederation secretary general eduardo deluca; former peruvian football federation president manuel burga; and bolivia’s football president, carlos chaves, already jailed in his own country.lynch said: “the department of justice really wants to end the corruption in the leadership of international football – not only because there is such a lot of corruption but also because the corruption is an insult to international principles.”the acting fifa president, issa hayatou, refused to comment on the detail of the latest arrests. but he said neither he nor the organization was corrupt. hayatou appeared for the first time before the media since he started the job in september, when blatter was suspended, and said the current crisis was the fault of a few bad people.“fifa is not corrupt. we have some people that have shown negative behaviour. but not everyone in fifa is corrupt,” said hayatou, president of the confederation of african football for more than 25 years. “there are lots of people who have been in fifa for more than 20 or 30 years that have not been accused of anything.”
elementary	the researchers were surprised by what people would do to avoid the task. what was the task? to sit in a chair and do nothing but think.some people found it so unbearable that they gave themselves mild electric shocks to stop the boredom.two-thirds of men pressed a button that gave them a painful shock during a 15-minute period of solitude. a quarter of women also pressed the shock button.the report from psychologists at virginia and harvard universities looks at the question of why most of us  nd it so hard to do nothing.in more than 11 separate studies, the researchers showed that all kinds of people hated being left alone to think ð it doesnõt matter what their age, education or income is, or how often they use smartphones or social media.researcher timothy wilson said that the results were probably not because of the speed of modern life or because of mobile phones and social media. instead, he said those things might be popular because we feel we need to do something and hate doing nothing. during the  rst experiments, students were taken into a room and told to think. they were alone, without their phones, books or anything to write with. the only rules were that they had to stay sitting and not fall asleep. they were told that they would have six to 15 minutes alone.the students were questioned at the end of the experiment. most of them did not enjoy the experience. they found it dif cult to concentrate and their minds wandered.the researchers did the experiment again with people at home. they got similar results. surprisingly, people found it even more dif cult and they cheated by getting up from their chair or checking their phones.the researchers did the study again with more than 100 people, aged 18 to 77, from a church and a farmersõ market. they also disliked just sitting and thinking.but, there was an even more surprising result. to check if people might prefer something bad to nothing at all, the students had the possibility of giving themselves a mild electric shock.before the experiment, all the students said they would pay to avoid mild electric shocks.but 12 of 18 men gave themselves electric shocks and six of 24 women gave themselves electric shocks.the scientists were surprised. they said that being alone with their thoughts was so hard for many participants that they gave themselves an electric shock, something the participants had said they would pay not to get.jessica andrews-hanna at the university of colorado said many students would probably give themselves an electric shock to make a boring lecture more exciting. but, she says we need to know more about wilsonõs study.òimagine ð a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will give them a harmless but uncomfortable shock, and they are told to just sit there with their thoughts,ó she said.òas they sit there, their mind starts to wander and naturally they think about that shock ð was it really that bad?ónannannannan
elementary	a british court has decided that three old kenyans, who were put in prison and tortured during the fighting in kenya in the 1950s, can sue the british government. there are thousands of other people who were put in prison and say they were treated badly during the final days of the british empire, and now they may also try to sue.british government lawyers said that too much time had passed since the seven-year fight in the 1950s, and it was no longer possible to have a fair trial. the court did not accept this. in 2011 the government said that the three claimants should sue the kenyan government because it became legally responsible after independence in 1963. but the judge did not accept this either.70,000 people were put in prison by the british in kenya, and more than 5,000 of them are still alive. many of them may sue the british government. the court decision may also make it possible for victims in other parts of the world to sue.the foreign office said it will appeal against the decision. “the normal time limit for a civil action is three to six years,” they said. “in this case, that period has been extended to over 50 years, but the people who made the decisions are dead and they can’t give their view of what happened.”the victory for paulo muoka nzili, 85, wambugu wa nyingi, 84, and jane muthoni mara, 73, was the result of a three-year battle in the courts. their lawyers said they had suffered terrible brutality. in the kenyan capital nairobi, nyingi and mara heard the news by mobile phone. they reacted with joy when they heard, hugging, dancing and praying.nyingi, who was put in prison and beaten, said: “for me … i just wanted everyone to know the truth. even the children of my children should know what happened. what should happen is that people should be compensated so they can begin to forgive the british government.” mara said: “i’m very happy and my heart is clean.”the judge said in 2011 that there was a lot of evidence to show that prisoners were perhaps tortured. he decided that a fair trial was possible, especially because thousands of secret documents from the colonial era were found in 2011.the british government’s lawyers accepted that all three of the old kenyans were tortured. the claimants’ lawyer said: “the british government has admitted that these three kenyans were brutally tortured but they have tried not to take any legal responsibility. there will be victims of colonial torture from malaya to the yemen, from cyprus to palestine, who will be very interested in this case.”people who fought in cyprus in the 1950s are interested in the mau mau case. one has already met the kenyan claimants’ lawyers. cypriot claimants could use british documents, and also the documents of the international committee of the red cross in geneva. those documents are kept secret for 40 years, and then opened to the public. the red cross recorded hundreds of torture cases in cyprus.there may also be claims from malaysia, where large numbers of people were put in prison during the 12-year war with communist fighters and their supporters that began in 1948. 24 farm workers, who were without weapons, were killed by british troops – their families are now fighting for a public inquiry. many ex-prisoners of the british in aden may also have claims against the british government. but aden is now part of yemen, and british lawyers may have problems making contact with possible claimants there.nannannan
elementary	passing clouds one of the good things about flying is seeing clouds very close. they seem to be light, but they carry a lot of water – around 500 tonnes in a small cloud. and water is heavier than air. so why don’t clouds fall out of the sky like rain? they do, but they take a very long time. an average cloud would take a year to fall one metre.on cloud nine most of us are happy to call clouds “fluffy ones” or “nasty black ones”, but there are more than 50 cloud types. the 50 cloud types fit into nine categories. cloud nine is the very big cumulonimbus, so to be “on cloud nine” means that you are on top of the world or very, very happy.around the rainbow the best place to see a rainbow is from a plane. rainbows are made when sunlight hits raindrops. we see a bow because the earth is in the way, but, from a plane, a rainbow is a complete circle.mr blue sky sunlight is white. it includes all the colours of the spectrum. as it passes through air, some of the light is scattered. blue light scatters more than other colours, so the blue looks like it comes from the sky.there’s life out there we usually only see clouds and other planes from a flying aircraft’s window, but the air is full of bacteria – 1,800 different types of bacteria.turbulence terror even someone who flies all the time can feel sick because of turbulence. the good news is that no modern airliner has ever crashed because of these sudden and violent movements of air. people have been hurt when they are not strapped in or falling luggage may hit them – but the plane is not going to fall out of the sky.you can’t cure jet lag the world is divided into time zones. when you take a long flight, the difference between local time and your body’s time causes jet lag. but jet lag can be reduced if you keep food bland for 24 hours before travel, drink a lot and live on your destination time from the moment you get on the aircraft.supersonic 747s many of us have travelled faster than sound. there are many jet streams in the air around the earth, especially on the journey from the us to europe. a jet stream can move as fast as 250 miles per hour. if an airliner flying at 550mph enters a jet stream, the result can be that the plane flies at 800mph. that’s faster than the speed of sound.flying through time flying across time zones means that we travel through time. but this time travel is so small that crossing the atlantic every week for 40 years would only move you 1/1,000th of a second into the future.terrible tea don’t blame the cabin attendant if your tea isn’t great. water should be just under 100°c when you pour it on to tea leaves – but that isn’t possible on a plane. it’s impossible to get water hotter than 90°c during flight – so choose coffee.i can’t hear my food people often say that airline food is bland and without taste. but some of the problem may not be bad food. a plane is a noisy place and food loses some of its taste when there are loud noises.needle in a haystack with modern technology, it seems strange that malaysian flight mh370 could disappear – but finding a missing aircraft is a needle-in-ahaystack problem. the plane knows where it is but it does not send this information anywhere. the problem is not technology – the problem is that there is no law that says that planes must send this information.volcanic fallout air travel can be cancelled by volcanic activity. ash melts in the heat of the engine, then solidifies on the rotors. it is very dangerous to ignore the volcanic ash.the wing myth for many years, we taught the wrong explanation for the way wings keep planes in the air. but now we know that a plane stays in the air because of newton’s third law of motion. the shape of the wing pushes air down. as the air is pushed down, the wing gets an equal and opposite push up, and this lifts the plane.nannannannan
elementary	ninety-six people died at sheffield wednesday’s hillsborough stadium in 1989. during an extraordinary day 23 years later at liverpool cathedral, where the families of the victims met to see a report on the disaster, the most important words were: the truth. this was the headline in the sun newspaper. we now know that the story in the newspaper was false and that the police gave them the story.margaret aspinall’s son james, then 18, died at the match between liverpool and nottingham forest. she said the families had to fight for 23 years for the truth. she said that the families’ sadness will never go away, but she is very pleased that the prime minister said sorry for hillsborough.an independent panel looked at 450,000 documents written by the police, sheffield wednesday and all the other groups involved. the panel then wrote a 395-page report. in the report they criticize official mistakes and say that the victims and other fans were not to blame. we already knew the cause of the disaster but we didn’t know that the police cover-up was so big. it is shocking how the police blamed the football fans for the disaster.the panel found that the south yorkshire police, led by the chief constable, peter wright, told their story that drunken fans or those without tickets caused the disaster. they tested the victims’ blood for alcohol. when victims had alcohol in their blood, the police then checked to find if they had criminal records. the police said that many liverpool fans were very drunk, were without tickets and were very violent, but the report found “no evidence” for this.the report said that wright met with police in a sheffield restaurant to prepare “a defence” and “a story”. the meeting happened just four days after the disaster. it was the day that the sun newspaper published its headline “the truth” and the story by four senior south yorkshire police officers.the panel found that officers’ statements were changed to remove criticism of the police and emphasize bad behaviour by fans. the panel found that 116 of 164 statements were changed “to remove or change negative comments about south yorkshire police”. the police said this was done only to remove “opinion” from the statements, but the panel said they did more than that. “it was done to remove criticism of the police,” the report said.the original inquiry did not believe this propaganda. it decided in august 1989 that the police stories of fan drunkenness and violence were false, and it criticized the police for telling lies. it said that sheffield wednesday’s stadium was unsafe, that the football association chose that stadium for the match without even checking if it had a safety certificate. it did not have a certificate.but “the main cause” of the disaster was the way the police controlled the crowd. the police lost control outside the stadium, where 24,000 liverpool fans had to go through just 23 small entrance gates. so police opened a large exit gate and lots of people were allowed in. they did not close one of the tunnels and, the inquiry said, this was their big mistake.but the police still repeated their lies at the inquest. the coroner decided not to take evidence of what happened after 3.15pm on the day of the disaster, so he did not look at the chaotic behaviour of the police and the ambulance service. the panel found that if the police and ambulance service had done their jobs better, they could have saved 41 of the 96 lives lost.there may now be a new inquest. there may be prosecutions too, after all these years, of sheffield wednesday, south yorkshire police and sheffield city council, which was responsible for the safety of the stadium. trevor hicks, whose two daughters died in the disaster, said: “the truth is out today,” hicks said. “tomorrow is for justice.”nannannannan
elementary	it is no longer legal to smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the worldõs drinking capital, new orleans, louisiana. since hurricane katrina in 2005, new orleans city government has begun trying to reduce noise problems. the city is now stricter on noise in bars and nightclubs ð and, at the same time, it has introduced new rules on noise.òit is the wrong time for this,ó complains bar-owner william walker. he hates the anti-smoking law. òif they force people outside the bar to smoke, it is going to increase the tension thatõs already there.ómany of new orleansõs best bars are in quiet neighbourhoods. martha wood lives beside a loud bar that has live music. òthe bar was one reason i bought the house so i wonõt ever complain about the noise,ó says wood. she also manages a live-music bar.the maple leaf club became smoke-free in 2014. another club also became smoke-free because performers asked for smoke-free nights. òa lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers. i wish the city had just let that happen, not force the ban into every bar that doesnõt have music,ó says zalia beville, manager of the all ways lounge.luckily, all ways has an outdoor patio. another bar, lost love lounge, doesnõt have a patio. the owner, geoff douville, loves the ban ð before, he felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar popular. òi couldnõt ban smoking in my bar without a ban in the whole city,ó says douville. òpeople think i have that choice. but, if i make a no-smoking rule, they will choose another bar with smoking.ómany small business owners also fear that the smoke-free rule will make them lose money. neil timms owns an english pub and saw a smoking ban before, in england. òback home in england, every pub i knew closed because of the smoking ban,ó remembers timms of englandõs ban, which began in 2007. to avoid the same problems, heõs spending money to build a patio.but douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity. òthere are lots of people who would enjoy coming to our bar but they never came because they didnõt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days ð now, those people can come.ó douville isnõt worried about noise complaints: òno court is going to say a bar is a ônuisanceõ after the city has introduced a smoking ban that forces you to go outside!ó he says.councilwoman latoya cantrell, who introduced the ban, disagrees: òthe responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their customers respectful outside as well,ó she says. òthe owners need to tell them to go and have a smoke but be respectful to their communities. the idea that we canõt have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous. we can have clean air without noise problems ð i think itõs about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.ómany people were worried that the police would not have time to give bars warnings and  nes. so the health department will do it. bar customers must ò ll out a form or call 311 and include photographs of illegal smokingó.geoff douville says that heõs used to noise complaints. òyou will see: the neighbours who complain about the noise now are going to be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban. of course theyõre going to complain,ó he adds. òbut it doesnõt mean theyõre going to win.ónannannan
elementary	the brand and logo of apple are the most valuable in the world. they are worth nearly $119 billion – that is more than the economies of morocco, ecuador or oman.the brand value of apple, the world’s biggest company, has increased by 21% in 12 months, the interbrand best global brands report said.people all around the world recognize apple by its simple “apple with a bite missing” logo. other technology companies have also done very well in the 2014 report. the technology companies pushed more traditional brands – such as coca-cola, mcdonald’s and gillette – down the table.google’s brand value rose by 15% to $107 billion to take second place. coca-cola, in third place, is up 3% to $81.5 billion. ibm’s value is $72.2 billion and microsoft’s $45.5 billion. they are in fourth and fifth places.facebook’s value has increased the most in the table. its brand value increased by 86% to $14.3 billion. it is at 29th place in the table, ahead of older global companies such as volkswagen, kellogg’s and ford.apple was started by steve jobs in his los altos garage in 1976. it only appeared in the top ten of the interbrand annual study in 2011.its logo was created by advertising executive rob janoff in 1977. it was designed with a bite taken out of it so that it would not look like a cherry.graham hayles, interbrand’s chief marketing officer, said, “apple makes a lot of money because it has a very strong brand. if you have a strong brand, you make more money.”many technology companies rose up the chart but some fell, too. finnish mobile-phone company nokia dropped 41 places to 98th at $4.1 billion, just ahead of nintendo in 100th place (down 33).a chinese company has appeared in the top 100 for the first time, with mobile-phone and broadband company huawei at 94th place. it has a brand value of $4.3 billion.most of the brands in the top 100 are american. the most valuable non-american brands are south korea’s samsung (6th), japan’s toyota (8th) and germany’s mercedes-benz (10th). the most valuable british brands are hsbc (33rd), shell (65th) and burberry (73rd).other fashion brands in the top 100 include boss, prada and ralph lauren. designer label louis vuitton is the top fashion name, in 19th position with a value of $23 billion, just ahead of clothing chain h&m, with a brand value of $21 billion in place 21.sports brand nike is at place 22 with a brand value of nearly $20 billion, ahead of its rival adidas at place 59 with a value of $7 billion.jez frampton, chief executive of interbrand, said that customers now have more control than ever over a brand’s reputation. this is because they can make comments about a brand on social media, such as twitter.“customers expect interaction, 24/7 accessibility, customization options and high levels of personalization,” he said.nannannan
advanced	the sight of colleagues and acquaintances taking a drag on an e-cigarette has become commonplace. but have we reached òpeak vapeó? statistics suggest that vaping among smokers and recent ex-smokers, who comprise the vast majority of vapers, may already be on the decline. the  gures will be studied closely by the major e-cigarette  rms, which have poured millions into promoting a technology that was thought to have been growing in popularity.figures released in 2014 by the health charity action on smoking and health (ash) reveal that usage among adults in britain of electronic cigarettes ð which do not contain tobacco and produce vapour, not smoke ð tripled from an estimated 700,000 users in 2012 to 2.1 million in 2014.however,  gures collated by the smoking toolkit study, a research body backed by the department of health that provides quarterly updates on smoking trends, show vapingõs appeal may be waning. vaping rates among smokers and ex-smokers rose steadily until the end of 2013, when some 22% of smokers and ex-smokers were vaping. but this proportion levelled out throughout 2014 before dropping to 19% during the  nal quarter of 2014. early signs suggest the decline has continued into 2015. the drop is described as òstatistically signi cantó by professor robert west, of uclõs department of epidemiology and public health, who collates the  gures for the toolkit.smokers are the key group for e-cigarette  rms because seven out of ten vapers are smokers. only around 1% of people who have never smoked have tried an electronic cigarette. ònumbers who use e-cigarettes while continuing to smoke are going down,ó west said. òweõve only been tracking vaping for just over a year, so itõs a short time period, but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term ex-smokers or ôneverõ smokers using e-cigarettes. that is not to say vaping rates might not change but, at this stage, it looks like theyõre staying the same.óthe levelling off in popularity of vaping in the uk would appear to be at odds with what is happening in the us, where the technology has been promoted aggressively and where recent reports suggested it was growing in popularity. however, west questioned the interpretation of us data, which made little distinction between people who had once tried an e-cigarette and those who regularly vaped.fears that vaping could become fashionable among young non-smokers appear to be misplaced, according to experts. only 1.8% of children are regular users, the ash study found. instead, e-cigarettes seem to be most popular among adults seeking to quit. òwhile the  gures published this month by smoking in england show that the use of electronic cigarettes by smokers has levelled off, their data also shows the huge increase in use since may 2011,ó said james dunworth, director and co-founder of ecigarettedirect.co.uk. òour customers are still very happy with the product, and technology and innovation in hardware is improving user experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes.óòe-cigarettes are behaving like a souped-up nicotine patch,ó west agreed. òthey are more popular than nicotine patches and may or may not be more effective. one-third of quit attempts use e-cigarettes, which makes them by far the most popular method of stopping.óhazel cheeseman, director of policy at ash, said it was too soon to say whether vaping had peaked. òalthough there are indications that the market hasnõt grown in the uk for about a year, there doesnõt seem to be a decline in the number of people using electronic cigarettes to help them quit smoking. using an electronic cigarette is safer than smoking; some, but not all, people  nd them useful to help quit smoking and there is little evidence that they are leading to an increase in young people smoking.óit emerged recently that the european commission (ec) is looking at increasing taxes on e-cigarettes, something that could have an impact on their popularity. a new ec tobacco directive comes into force in 2016 that will limit the amount of nicotine in e-cigarettes to below their current levels. this may mean vapers will have to increase their usage to obtain the same hit, again something that may make e-cigarettes more expensive.west suggested that policymakers should see e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid and not subject them to the same regulations as smoking. òthere is a tendency among some local authorities and organizations to treat e-cigarettes as cigarettes and ban them in public places and outdoors,ó he said. òthe problem is that brings public health into disrepute. it just sounds like youõre having a go at vapers and hitting everyone with a sledgehammer and that undermines the public health messages weõre trying to get out. we have to be careful not to stigmatize e-cigarettes.ó

òthere is guilt over being rich in the  rst place,ó he said. òthere is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich. and, then, there is the isolation ð being in the 1%, it turns out, can be lonely.ó it seems f scott fitzgerald was right: the very rich òare different from you and meó.counsellors argue things have become worse since the  nancial crisis and the debate over income inequality that has been spurred on by movements like occupy wall street and the fight for $15 fair wage campaign.òthe occupy wall street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% and painted them globally as something negative,ó said jamie traeger-muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the wealth legacy group. the media, she said, is partly to blame for making the rich òfeel like they need to hide or feel ashamedó.traeger-muney runs a global  rm and specializes in working with inheritors, who often get a bad reputation in the press. òyou can come up with lots of words and sayings about inheritors ð not one of them is positive: spoilt brat, born with a silver spoon in their mouth, trust-fund babies, all these things,ó she said, adding that itõs òeasy to scapegoat the richó.òsometimes, i am shocked by things that people say. you would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealth holders.óòitõs really isolating to have a lot of money. peopleõs reactions to you can be scary,ó said barbara nusbaum, an expert in money psychology. òwe are all taught not to talk about money. itõs not polite to talk about money. ironically, itõs harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money. itõs much more socially acceptable to say ôi am broke. things are hard.õ you canõt say ôi have a ton of money.õ you have to keep a lot of your life private.óas a result, cockrell points out, the rich tend to hang out with other rich americans, not out of snobbery but in order to be around those who understand them and their problems.the growing gap between the rich and poor is a global phenomenon. according to oxfam, the richest 1% have seen their share of global wealth increase from 44% in 2009 to 48% in 2014 and are on track to own more than the other 99% by 2016.in the us, over the last three decades, the wealth owned by the top 0.1% households increased from 7% to 22% even as the wealth of the bottom 90% of households declined.the number of extremely wealthy people has also been climbing. according to research from spectrem group, in 2014, the number of us households with $1m or more in assets ð excluding the value of their primary home ð increased by 500,000 to 10.1m. in 2007, that number was 9.2m. households worth $5m or more reached 1.3m and 142,000 households are now worth $25m or more.since the 2008  nancial crisis, the income gap has expanded and the situation òhas gotten worse for the wealthyó, cockrell said. the main reason?

advanced	lots of us know we are sleep-deprived but imagine if we could  x it with a fairly simple solution: getting up later. in a speech at the british science festival, dr paul kelley, clinical research associate at the sleep and circadian neuroscience institute at oxford university, called for schools to stagger their starting times to work with the natural biological rhythms of their students. it would improve cognitive performance, exam results and studentsõ health (sleep deprivation has been linked with diabetes, depression, obesity and an impaired immune system).it follows a paper, published in 2014, in which he noted that, when children are around ten, their biological wake-up time is about 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and, at 18, someone you may think of as a lazy teenager actually has a natural waking hour of 9am. the conventional school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not 16- to 18-year-olds. for the older teenagers, it might be more sensible to start the school day at 11am or even later. òa 7am alarm call for older adolescents,ó kelley and his colleagues pointed out in the paper, òis the equivalent of a 4.30am start for a teacher in their 50s.óhe says itõs not as simple as persuading teenagers to go to bed earlier. òthe bodyõs natural rhythm is controlled by a particular kind of light,ó says kelley. òthe eye doesnõt just contain rods and cones; it contains cells that then report to the suprachiasmatic nuclei in the hypothalamus.ó this part of the brain controls our circadian rhythms over a 24-hour cycle. òitõs the light that controls it. itõs like saying: ôwhy canõt you control your heartbeat?õóbut it isnõt just students who would bene t from a later start. kelley says the working day should be more forgiving of our natural rhythms. describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: òbetween 14 and 24, itõs more than two hours. for people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35, itõs about an hour and a half. that can continue up until youõre about 55 when itõs in balance again. the 10-year-old and 55-year-old wake and sleep naturally at the same time.óthis might be why, he adds, the traditional nine to  ve is so ingrained; it is maintained by bosses, many of them in their mid-50s and upwards because òit is best for themó. so, should workplaces have staggered starting times, too? should those in their 50s and above come in at 8am, while those in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage intern or apprentice be encouraged to turn up at 11am? kelley says that synchronized hours could have òmany positive consequences. the positive side of this is peopleõs performance, mood and health will improve. itõs very uplifting in a way because itõs a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.óthere would probably be fewer accidents as drivers would be more alert, he says. it could spell the end of rush hour as people stagger their work and school-run times. a later start to the day for many, says kelley, òis something that would bene t everyone, particularly families. parents go and try to wake up teenagers who are waking up three hours too early. it creates tensions for everybody.óso, what time does kelley start work? òi am 67 so that means iõm back to being ten years old and i get up just after six. i wake naturally.ó and, yes, he says he  nds the start of his working day much easier now than he did when he was younger.
advanced	if the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by just 25%, there would be enough food to feed all the people who are malnourished, according to the un. each year, 1.3bn tonnes of food, about a third of all that is produced, is wasted, including about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of  sh and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat. meanwhile, 795 million people suffer from severe hunger and malnutrition.well-publicized attempts to combat the loss of food ð such as recent laws in france that require supermarkets to distribute unsold food to charities ð have highlighted the issue of food waste, identi ed by the un as one of the great challenges to achieving food security. estimates suggest that, by 2050, food production will need to have increased by 60% on 2005 levels to feed a growing global population. reducing food wastage would ease the burden on resources as the world attempts to meet future demand.the problem is global but manifests itself in very different ways. in developing countries, there are high levels of what is known as òfood lossó, which is unintentional wastage, often due to poor equipment, transportation and infrastructure. in wealthy countries, there are low levels of unintentional losses but high levels of òfood wasteó, which involves food being thrown away by consumers because they have purchased too much or by retailers who reject food because of strict aesthetic standards.in developed countries, consumers and retailers throw away between 30% and 40% of all food purchased, whereas in poorer countries only 5% to 16% of food is thrown away. according to a 2011 report, in europe and north america, each person wasted 95 to 115kg of otherwise edible food annually, whereas, in sub-saharan africa and south and south-east asia, the equivalent waste was just 6 to 11kg.òin the developing world, food waste is virtually non-existent,ó says robert van otterdijk, coordinator of the un food and agriculture organizationõs save food programme. òfood waste is happening in countries where people can afford to throw away food. one statistic is that the amount of food wasted by consumers in industrialized countries [222m tonnes a year] is almost the same as the total net food production of sub-saharan africa [230m tonnes]. but food losses, on the other hand, are really rampant in developing countries because of the underdeveloped conditions they have, from management of production to transportation and distribution.óthe environmental impact of food loss and waste is high. the carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is estimated at 3.3 gigatonnes of co2, meaning that, if food waste were a country, it would rank as the third highest national emitter of greenhouse gases after the us and china. about 1.4bn hectares, or close to 30% of available agricultural land, is used to grow or farm food that is subsequently wasted. and more surface and groundwater, or òblue wateró, is used to produce wasted food around the globe than is used for agriculture by any single country, including india and china. òthe whole issue of climate change has to do with our economy of production and consumption being out of balance with what the earth can provide,ó says van otterdijk. òproduction of food is one of the biggest production sectors in the world and, if one-third of all this is just produced in vain, you can imagine what a huge impact this has on the natural resources ð on land, water, energy and greenhouse gas emissions.óthe worst food waste offenders are the us, canada, australia and new zealand, where consumers waste 39% of all food purchased, followed by europe, where about 31% of all food purchased by consumers is thrown away. in the uk, 15m tonnes of food is lost or wasted each year. british consumers throw away 4.2m tonnes of edible food each year. this means that 11.7% of all food purchased is avoidably wasted, at an estimated cost to each family of £700 a year or almost £60 a month.the foods most commonly found in british bins are bread, vegetables, fruit and milk. according to a nationwide analysis of food waste in uk households, the most wasted food in the uk by weight is bread, with consumers throwing away 414,000 tonnes (22.4%) of all bread purchased. by percentage, the most wasted food is lettuce and leafy salads, of which consumers throw away 38% (64,000 tonnes) of all they buy.the most wasted meat, by both percentage and weight, is poultry, of which 13% of all edible parts (not including bones) is wasted and the most wasted fruit by percentage is melon, with the equivalent of more than a quarter of each melon thrown in the bin.the uk has made progress in the past ten years, after a concerted campaign to reduce wastage. it is singled out by van otterdijk as òone of the great successesó in combating food waste. between 2007 and 2012, the amount of avoidable food waste produced by uk households decreased by 21%, from 5.3m tonnes to 4.2m tonnes, largely due to greater awareness. of the food that is not eaten, less is ending up in land ll. in 2000ð01, only 14% of household waste was recycled or composted but, by 2011-12, the amount of composted food had risen to 43%.van otterdijk says there has been a òvery encouraging, unexpected, continuing interestó in the subject of food waste, enabling grass-roots campaigns around the world to gain momentum. òwe have to do much more and it needs the participation of public and private sectors,ó he says. òbut if it continues like this, with the same momentum, maybe, after ten years, weõll have globally signi cant results.ó
advanced	setting aside epic disaster-movie moments such as volcanoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, there are two key natural factors that can make a city vulnerable to gradual disintegration or even total disappearance ð water and sand.were climate change making the planet colder rather than hotter, we could add ice to the list ð for nothing obliterates a city like a billion-tonne glacier grinding its way down a valley. the impact of a rare òice tsunamió in 2013 on the canadian municipality of ochre beach was just a taster: a wall of melting iceberg on dauphin lake was blown by winds on to the shore, splintering every house in its path.but ochre beach was an anomaly. elsewhere, the planetõs melting ice is making cities vulnerable by the less dramatic route of raising sea levels. a century ago, venice ð one of the most beautiful and low-lying cities in the world ð used to  ood around ten times a year. nowadays, its lowest point, piazza san marco (only three feet above sea level) is inundated with water approximately 100 times annually.but rising sea levels are not entirely to blame. in many parts of the world, the land is also sinking ð in veniceõs case, subsoil compaction (a result of industrial exploitation of the surrounding area) lowered the city by 20cm between 1950 and 1970. ho chi minh city in vietnam is also sinking by about 2cm a year ð but thatõs nothing compared to jakarta, which is dropping 10 to 20cm annually. in the past three decades, the city has sunk roughly four metres, rendering its 40-year-old seawall ever less effective.unfortunately for the indonesian capital, it has pumped out so much groundwater to support its population that the land above is drying out and compacting, thereby creating a bowl. rivers that used to  ow through the city down to the sea have had to be diverted because they cannot drain uphill.while there are many plans to save venice ð and ho chi minh city and jakarta are taking the problem seriously ð the same cannot be said for miami, where politicians refuse to admit the city has a severe environmental problem.miamiõs dif culties are threefold. the florida resort lies less than ten feet above sea level; an increasing number of tropical storms are inundating the city; and it is built on porous limestone, which is absorbing the rising seawater. this water then  lls the cityõs foundations and bubbles up through drains and pipes, forcing sewage upwards and polluting its fresh water. there is every chance miami may one day become uninhabitable.in the maldives, the populations of whole islands are now looking to abandon their homes. the capital, male_, population 153,379 and only four feet above sea level, has used japanese investment to build a ten-foot sea wall at a cost of $63 million ð but, long term, only a stabilization of rising sea levels will save it and the rest of the islands.and itõs not just the sea ð rainfall is also endangering cities across the world. recently, an entire summerõs worth of rain fell in one morning on detroit, overwhelming its outdated sewerage systems. impoverished by the collapse of americaõs car industry, the city is struggling to build a system to cope. drinking water is also affected because detroit is particularly vulnerable to water-borne pathogens.in africa, deserti cation is causing the sahara to spread south at a rate of 30 miles per year, threatening settlements in northern mauritania. over the past 20 years, for example, the desert has grown by more than 260 acres around the trading and religious centre of chinguetti, which has seen its population decline from 20,000 people in the mid-twentieth century to just a few thousand now. trading has all but ceased as sand piles up in the streets.likewise, the californian resort of rancho mirage, near palm springs, may have to be abandoned in the next decade. this city is just one example of a problem caused not so much by global warming as human over-expansion in the face of  nite resources. californiaõs dream of farming the desert made sense while its total population remained around half a million (in 1870) ð but, now, the state is home to 38 million people, who, between them, own 32 million vehicles and expect to be surrounded by lawns and golf courses.the daily water use in rancho mirage is more than 200 gallons per person, which is giving rise to a man-made drought. a 25% cut in water consumption has been implemented but this is unlikely to stabilize the resort, which is surrounded by sand and dust. the long-term answer in californiaõs desert is likely to be the abandonment of some cities while consolidating the populations of others. human  ight is the  nal proof of a cityõs disintegration. once we stop maintaining a city, nature takes over very quickly. japanõs hashima island was turned into a concrete city in 1887 to exploit undersea coal reserves ð but, in 1974, with coal supplies nearing depletion, the mine was closed and hashima was abandoned. now, the sea spray is causing its concrete walls to collapse.fire is a growing threat to urban settlements in america ð in fact, forest  res cause the most damage after severe storms, with 800 major  re disasters having been declared there between 1953 and 2014. a newly released report by the usda forest service maps the increasing number of urban locations that are particularly vulnerable to wildfire. similarly, in australia, some of victoriaõs resorts and several melbourne suburbs have been placed on a list of the stateõs 52 most vulnerable bush re spots because long-term droughts are making trees highly combustible. itõs unlikely that a forest  re will ever destroy an entire city but a succession of  res could render it uninhabitable ð and abandonment remains one of the most powerful causes of urban collapse.many cities are  ghting a losing battle against the ravages of nature but is it possible to identify the worlds most vulnerable metropolis? natural events are notoriously hard to predict but the prospects for male do look particularly grim for, even if its new sea wall continues to be effective, the islands around the maldives capital are going to disappear before too long. and, if they disappear, so does males raison detre.
advanced	scientists have connected the brains of a pair of animals and allowed them to share sensory information in a major step towards what the researchers call the world’s first “organic computer”.the us team fitted two rats with devices called brain-to-brain interfaces that let the animals collaborate on simple tasks to earn rewards, such as a drink of water. in one radical demonstration of the technology, the scientists used the internet to link the brains of two rats separated by thousands of miles, with one in the researchers’ lab at duke university in durham, north carolina, and the other in natal, brazil.led by miguel nicolelis, a pioneer of devices that allow paralyzed people to control computers and robotic arms with their thoughts, the researchers say their latest work may enable multiple brains to be hooked up to share information. “these experiments showed that we have established a sophisticated, direct communication linkage between brains,” nicolelis said in a statement. “basically, we are creating what i call an organic computer.”the scientists first demonstrated that rats can share, and act on, each other’s sensory information by electrically connecting their brains via tiny grids of electrodes that reach into the motor cortex, the brain region that processes movement.the rats were trained to press a lever when a light went on above it. when they performed the task correctly, they got a drink of water. to test the animals’ ability to share brain information, they put the rats in two separate compartments. only one compartment had a light that came on above the lever. when the rat pressed the lever, an electronic version of its brain activity was sent directly to the other rat’s brain. in trials, the second rat responded correctly to the imported brain signals 70% of the time by pressing the lever.remarkably, the communication between the rats the rats collaborated on a task that required them to distinguish between narrow and wide openings using their whiskers. was two-way. if the receiving rat failed at the task, the first rat was not rewarded with a drink, and appeared to change its behaviour to make the task easier for its partner. in further experiments,in the final test, the scientists connected rats on different continents and beamed their brain activity back and forth over the internet. “even though the animals were on different continents, with the resulting noisy transmission and signal delays, they could still communicate,” said miguel pais-vieira, the first author of the study. “this tells us that we could create a workable network of animal brains distributed in many different locations.”nicolelis said the team is now working on ways to link several animals’ brains at once to solve more complex tasks. “we cannot even predict what kinds of emergent properties would appear when animals begin interacting as part of a ‘brain-net’,” he said. “in theory, you could imagine that a combination of brains could provide solutions that individual brains cannot achieve by themselves.” the research is published in the journal scientific reports.anders sandberg, who studies the ethics of neurotechnologies at the future of humanity institute at oxford university, said the work was “very important” in helping to understand how brains encode information. but the implications of the technology and its potential future uses are far broader, said sandberg. “the main reason we are running the planet is that we are amazingly good at communicating and coordinating. without that, although we are very smart animals, we would not dominate the planet.”“i don’t think there’s any risk of supersmart rats from this,” he added. “there’s a big difference between sharing sensory information and being able to plan. i’m not worried about an imminent invasion of ‘rat multiborgs’.”very little is known about how thoughts are encoded and how they might be transmitted into another person’s brain, so that is not a realistic prospect any time soon. and much of what is in our minds is what sandberg calls a “draft” of what we might do. “often, we don’t want to reveal those drafts; that would be embarrassing and confusing. and a lot of those drafts are changed before we act. most of the time i think we’d be very thankful not to be in someone else’s head.”
advanced	bogus allergy tests are convincing thousands of people to take unnecessary treatments and put themselves or their children on inadequate diets, sometimes resulting in malnutrition, a group of experts and charities has said. allergies and food intolerances are soaring but confusion between the two, as well as the many misdiagnoses, are causing real harm, said the information organization sense about science, which has produced a guide in collaboration with allergy specialists and charities.“it’s probably the biggest mess for science communication, where myths, misinterpreted studies and quackery collide with under- and over-diagnosis,” said tracey brown, director of sense about science. “the costs are huge – unnecessary actions for some and not enough action for those whose lives depend on it.”experts fear that restaurants and caterers are seeing so many people claiming they have allergies (which can be dangerous for the individual), when in fact they have a food intolerance (which is not), that they may not take all the precautions they should when serving a person who has a genuine allergy.“it matters very much,” said moira austin of the anaphylaxis campaign. “if a caterer thinks somebody is just avoiding a food because they don’t want to get bloated, they may be less careful. there have been a number of fatalities where people have gone to a restaurant and alerted staff that they have an allergy to a particular food and the meal has been served up containing that allergen.”the guide says most internet and shop-bought allergy tests have no scientific basis. they include a home-testing kit that looks for specific igg (immunoglobulin g) antibodies against food stuffs in the blood. while these antibodies are part of the immune system’s response to infections, “the best medical evidence has shown elevated igg levels do not suggest an allergy”, the guide says. “results are frequently positive in individuals who do not have an allergy or a food intolerance.”also debunked is a test, a mixture of acupuncture and homeopathy, which attempts to measure electronic resistance across the skin while the child or adult holds the suspect food in their hand. hair follicle testing is also pointless, the guide says. “hair is not involved in allergic reactions so testing hair samples cannot provide any useful information on allergic status.” nor should people be deceived into thinking allergies are caused by an “energy blockage” that can be diagnosed by muscle testing and cured by acupuncture.“i commonly see children who’ve been put on to unnecessarily restricted diets because their parents assume, in good faith, that they have allergies to multiple foods on the basis of ‘allergy tests’ that have no scientific basis,” said paul seddon, a consultant paediatric allergist, on behalf of the uk cochrane centre, an independent organization that assesses medical evidence. “this needs to stop, which can only happen if we debunk these ‘tests’.”another consultant paediatric allergist, adam fox from guys and st thomas’ hospital in london, said: “i get a number of patients, and my colleagues likewise, who will come in having sent their hair off for analysis or having excluded a whole range of foods for their children. it is very difficult to untangle that. there are two challenges. children need to be given proper diets but more of it is the unnecessary avoidance of things that aren’t harmful, which has a huge impact on the quality of life. a child who can’t eat wheat or drink milk can’t go to parties.”the conviction that a child’s chronic lethargy or headaches or eczema are caused by an allergy takes a long time and many tests to prove or disprove. it is tempting to go to an alternative therapist who will do a single test and provide a quick, but inaccurate, answer.allergies are on the rise across developed countries. the percentages of children diagnosed with allergic rhinitis and eczema have both trebled in the last 30 years. while there is now better diagnosis, the rise in incidence is real, leading many more people to suspect allergies are the reason for their own or their children’s health issues. the guide lists a number of myths about the sources of allergies, from the suggestion that they are caused by e numbers in food colourings to “toxic overload” and fast food.
advanced	it has charted the world’s highest peaks, the ocean floor, the amazon rainforest and even provided a glimpse into north korea. but google’s mission to map the world has largely steered clear of the inhospitable arctic.now, however, the search-engine firm is embarking on what might be the most significant update to centuries of polar cartography – and one it hopes will help provide a better understanding of life on the permafrost for millions of web users. google has flown a small team to iqaluit, the largest town in the canadian territory of nunavut, armed with their warmest winter gear, a stack of laptop computers and an 18kg backpackmounted telescopic camera.helped by an inuit mapping expert, and stalked by curious locals, the team spent four days trudging through the terrain and collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on the tundra of baffin island what urbanites across the globe now take for granted.the town of 7,000 people will go on display via google’s popular street view application in july 2013.aaron brindle, project leader, said: “i live in toronto and i absolutely take for granted that everything is where it should be and that this map is kind of my world, but for so long that hasn’t been the case in the north.”unlike more populous and accessible parts of the world, which have been mapped using a special camera mounted on a car roof, the iqaluit project had mappers hiking the town’s snow-packed roads and traversing little-known trails, some of which are made of ice and disappear in the brief summer months.the team also cut a path along part of a 15km cul-de-sac known as the road to nowhere, despite warnings about the risk from polar bears and other wildlife.mayor john graham said the digital cartographers were, however, hunted by a herd of excited and curious locals, or google stalkers.graham understands the enthusiasm. the street view project, he said, follows in the footsteps of the english explorer martin frobisher, who in 1576 sailed into the bay where iqaluit now sits while searching for the northwest passage, and the 1941 flight of captain elliott roosevelt, a reconnaissance officer and son of the us president, which led to the site being chosen for a military airbase. his exploration led to the founding of the modern town of iqaluit, which is the seat of government as well as a transport and communications hub for nunavut.one of the initial challenges google faced was gathering the raw data needed to fill in their existing map. what they had created using satellite images was fairly accurate, although the rapid pace of the town’s growth, which has been fuelled by a mining boom, meant they were missing one road that had been created in the past year, said arif sayani, the town’s director of planning.another difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office rather than delivered to their address. plotting the po box addresses would result in a map with firms, banks and schools clustered around the canada post building in the centre of town.about 30 inuit elders, entrepreneurs and high-school pupils turned out one night to help correct such problems. they were provided with a laptop computer and instructed how to ensure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up accurately on the map.the project is more than a novelty or cultural philanthropy. sayani, 32, said the town would be able to use the maps as a promotional tool for those thinking of visiting or moving to the area. it may also speed up planning decisions that will affect iqaluit’s growth.the test run for the iqaluit mapping exercise occurred last summer in cambridge bay, a much smaller nunavut town of about 1,500 people located 1,700km and a time zone west of iqaluit.the gravel roads and muddy puddles that can now be seen online, however, give little sense of life in a land usually covered in snow, which is one reason why google selected the lesshospitable month of march to travel to iqaluit.brindle said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns, though the high costs of shipping and airfares to move people and equipment around the vast arctic territory appears to be weighing on google’s ambitions.the next northern site has not yet been identified but, when it is selected, brindle said the company might simply send one of its hi-tech backpacks and rely on volunteers to literally put themselves on the map.“i’m hoping that three, four, five years from now we’ll look back and see a very different map of canada’s north,” brindle added.
advanced	david mitchell, a regular contender for the man booker literary prize, is used to his novels being picked over by the critics. so, it’s something of a relief, says the british author, that his latest work – completed at 1am one tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to norway – won’t be seen by anyone until 2114.mitchell is the second contributor to the scottish artist katie paterson’s future library project, for which 1,000 trees were planted in 2014 in oslo’s nordmarka forest. starting with margaret atwood, who handed over the manuscript of a text called scribbler moon in 2015, each year for the next 100 years, an author will deliver a piece of writing that will only be read in 2114, when the trees are chopped down to make paper on which the 100 texts will be printed.each author – their names revealed year by year and chosen by a panel of experts and paterson, while she is alive – will make the trek to the spot in the forest high above oslo, where they will surrender their manuscripts in a short ceremony.“it’s a little glimmer of hope in a season of highly depressing news cycles, which affirms we are in with a chance of civilization in a hundred years,” said mitchell. “everything is telling us that we’re doomed but the future library is a candidate on the ballot paper for possible futures. it brings hope that we are more resilient than we think: that we will be here, that there will be trees, that there will be books and readers, and civilization.”mitchell said he found writing the book “quite liberating because i won’t be around to take the consequences of this being good or bad ... but, i’m sandwiched between margaret atwood and no doubt some other brilliant writer. so, it better be good. what a historic fool of epochal proportions i’d look if they opened it in 2114 and it wasn’t any good.”usually, says mitchell, who was shortlisted for the man booker for his novels number9dream and cloud atlas, he “polishes and polishes” his writing. “actually, i over-polish. but, this was very different – i wrote up to the wire. so, the first two-thirds were polished and the final third i didn’t have time. and, it was a liberation.”future library creator, paterson, whose past works have involved her mapping dead stars and compiling a slide archive of the history of darkness through the ages, asked the writers to tackle “the theme of imagination and time, which they can take in so many directions”. mitchell revealed only the name of the manuscript, from me flows what you call time, during a ceremony in the norwegian woods next to where paterson’s 1,000 trees are planted. the title is taken from a piece of music by japanese composer toru takemitsu but, other than admitting that “it’s somewhat more substantial a thing than i was expecting”, the author would say nothing.handing over his text in the forest, sheltered from the intermittent rain by an umbrella and amid the foot-high shoots of 1,000 pine trees, mitchell read his damp audience of children and adults a short story and william wordsworth’s a slumber did my spirit seal. its ending, “rolled round in earth’s diurnal course / with rocks, and stones, and trees”, felt appropriate in this small section of forest, carpeted with blueberry bushes, which will be carefully tended to for the next 98 years before it is turned into future library’s manuscripts.“how vain to suppose the scribblings of little old me will be of enduring interest to future generations. yet, how low-key and understated, to slave over a manuscript that nobody will ever pat you on the back for and say: ‘nice one’ or ‘god, i loved the bit where she did that and he did this ...’” mitchell wrote in a piece for the future library.his manuscript, now delivered, will be sealed and placed alongside atwood’s in a wood-lined room in oslo’s new public library, which will open in 2019. watched over by a trust of experts until it is finally printed, it is now, says the novelist, “as gone from me as a coin dropped in a river”.
