intermediate	the view from the visitors centre at the southern edge of donana national park in southern spain is an ornithologists dream: 200,000 hectares of wetlands vital for the birdlife of western europe. dozens of britains most loved migratory birds rest here every year on their migrations from africa. donana is also home to some of europes rarest birds, including the spanish imperial eagle.it is a glorious, vibrant landscape but it exists on a knife-edge. in 1998, almost two billion gallons of acidic water, mixed with waste metals, poured into the park from the los frailes mine 45km away. a toxic tsunami of waste poured down the guadiamar river into the park. more than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh were collected afterwards and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed.it was spains worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost ¬90m. suddenly aware of donanas status as the nations most important natural site, spain decided to spend a further ¬360m, some of it eu money, on restoring the landscape. in the 1950s and 60s, some parts of this landscape had been drained to create rice and cotton  elds. some of this farmland is now being returned to its original wetland state.it has been a costly but positive process. but donana is still in trouble thanks to the increasing pressures of modern life. there are plans to build an oil pipeline through donana and other developers want to build new hotels and golf courses, which would need enormous water supplies. sand and soil washed from nearby farms is also blocking the channels that cross donana.however, the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the andalucian government to reopen the frailes mine that nearly destroyed donana in 1998. this is europes most precious bird sanctuary, for indigenous species and also as a resting place for birds that migrate between africa and britain and other parts of north-west europe, says laurence rose of the rspb (royal society for the protection of birds). donana already faces a large number of threats, but now they want to bring back the very cause of the disaster 16 years ago. it is extremely worrying.the state of the local economy provides an explanation for the governments decision. the crash of spains banks in 2008 had a catastrophic effect on the region and unemployment in some parts of andalucia is now more than 30%. reopening the mine would provide more than 1,000 jobs.there are riches here, riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants, said energy spokesman vicente fernandez guerrero. we think mining is a good way to make it possible to allow local people to continue to live in the area. this is a mining area. people have been digging metals here since roman times.fernandez said that the mine licence would only allow modern mining techniques, which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste. also, the canadian company that ran los frailes when the disaster happened cannot run it again. the best technology in the world will be used here, fernandez insisted. liquid will not be used. we are going to insist on that.the plan has some support in the area, but it also has a lot of opposition. carlos davila, who works for the spanish ornithological society in donana, was also alarmed at the plan. this is a very, very bad idea, he said. they say the new mine will be safe, but they said it was safe in 1998 and look what happened. we got the worst ecological disaster in the history of spain.almost every visitor at a local restaurant had a camera and telescopic lens or a pair of binoculars. there is a big tourist trade because of the birdlife of don_ana. this is not surprising because this is a very special place. a huge sky hangs over this  at but certainly not boring landscape. birds of every shape and size  ll the air and sometimes the road. at one point on my visit, a stork calmly stood in front of our car until it felt ready to  y off.the trouble is that spain does not have the public resources it had 16 years ago. a repeat of the toxin spill today would have a much, much more damaging impact, said rose. this point is supported by davila. after the disaster, spain realized that it had a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it, he added. now, we seem to be forgetting that lesson. it is very depressing.nan
intermediate	himalayan lakes, spacewalks and the us presidential campaign helped scott kelly stay sane during his 340 days in space, the astronaut told journalists after he landed back on earth from a record-breaking mission. òit seemed like i lived there forever,ó kelly said. he had been on several previous missions but said that his biggest surprise was simply how long this one felt. òmaybe, occasionally, you do go bananas,ó he said.kelly and a russian colleague, mikhail kornienko, spent nearly a year on the international space station (iss) in order to study the effects of weightlessness, radiation and the cramped conditions of space ight on humans. nasa considers this research essential for a future mission to mars.kelly said the length of the mission was its biggest challenge and that he felt much more sore when he returned to gravity than after shorter trips. kelly and his twin brother, mark, a retired astronaut, have spent the last year taking physical and mental tests. the tests will continue, to help nasa learn about how the body copes with the severe strains of space ight.he said the discomfort of returning to gravity took nothing from the sense of wonder he felt after he landed back on earth. when the russian capsule opened on to the cool air of kazakhstan, kelly said, he smelled òa fragrance like a plant was blooming in that areaó. it was the fresh air mixed with the charred, òkind of sweetó smell of a spacecraft that had survived re-entry through the atmosphere.as he left the spacecraft, he said, the importance of the mission began to sink in: 340 days on a 15-year- old space station which is òa million pounds, the size of a football  eld, the internal volume, some say, of a six-bedroom houseó. the iss, he said, is a place that uses the power of the sun and was built with the help of an international team.òthere are things weõre going to discover about our experience in space in the space station that we donõt even know now,ó kelly said, comparing the research of more than 450 missions there to the work done by computer scientists at nasa in the 1960s and 1970s. he added: òthe view is great, too.ókelly made the most of that view ð he posted spectacular photos on social media of the earthõs cities, landscapes, oceans and atmosphere. òthe earth is a beautiful planet,ó he said, describing the beautiful waters around the bahamas and the rainbow colours of the lakes of the northern himalayas. he said he would like to visit that region, though he would  rst need to learn òwhat country actually owns themó. but, òmainly, you just notice how thin the atmosphere is,ó kelly added. òthat, together with these large areas of pollution, is kind of alarming.óthe astronaut said he could see entire systems of pollution: smoke clouds from wild res that covered parts of the us, sections of asia with continuous, visible pollution nearly all year round. he said the message òwe need to save the planetó wasnõt completely correct: òthe planet will get better; itõs us that wonõt be here because weõll destroy the environment.ó the worldõs thin shield of atmosphere òmakes you more of an environmentalist after spending so much time looking downó, he said.òitõs for us to take care of the air we breathe and the water we drink. and i do believe we have an impact on that and we do have the ability to change it, if we make the decision to.ó kelly was very active on social media, which made many people follow him online. but he said he was unaware of it. instead, he watched the drama of the 2016 us presidential election.besides the news, he said, steady work helped keep him sane: òi tried to have milestones that were close, like when is the next crew arriving, the next spacewalk, the next science experiment. that made a difference to me ð it kept my sanity.ó being back on earth with the rest of humanity had not quite sunk in, he added. he recalled how shocked he had been to see a crowd of people after a previous mission. òiõll soon start feeling that kind of culture shock,ó he said.kelly predicted that he would not  y again with nasa. òbut i donõt think i would ever say iõm absolutely, 100%  nished,ó he added, because of the sudden successes of private space ight companies such as spacex. òthey might need a guy like me someday,ó he said. òmaybe, in the next 20 years, youõll be able to buy a cheap ticket, just go for a little visit.ónannan
intermediate	hundreds of young cubans are using the first known free, open-access internet service in the communist island nation. it has been made possible by one of cuba’s most famous artists. a small cultural centre in the capital city, havana, has suddenly become a rare source of free wi-fi. the internationally known cuban artist kcho is providing the service. perhaps more surprisingly, the service has been approved by the state-owned telecommunications company, etecsa.people say the service is very slow, especially when the centre gets crowded. but, in a country where only about 5% of the population has unrestricted access to the internet, a facility that is both free of charge and free of restrictions is being welcomed.the chance to click on international news websites, communicate with friends and family overseas and use sites like facebook and twitter has created a lot of excitement. “i come as often as i can,” said adonis ortiz, 20, while video-chatting with his father, who lives in the us and whom he has not seen in nine years.as diplomatic and trade relations between the us and cuba improve, american tech giants such as google and apple are expected to enter the cuban market as soon as they are permitted. in the meantime, cuba has installed a high-speed fibre-optic cable under the sea from venezuela and internet users have some access to chinese equipment.another estimate, that a quarter of cubans have access to the internet – still one of the lowest rates in the western hemisphere – in fact measures residents who use a restricted domestic intranet that only features certain websites and has limited email.kcho has offered the public admission to his own personal internet connection. but this is not the action of a counter-revolutionary or free-market rebel. kcho was probably chosen as the acceptable face of a government recognizing the inevitable attractions of the internet.kcho, who has close ties to the cuban government, announced that his actions had been approved by the ministry of culture. the artist said he wanted to encourage cubans to familiarize themselves with the internet. “it’s only possible if you are determined and if you absorb the costs,” kcho told the associated press. “it is expensive but the benefit is tremendous. i have something that is great and powerful. i can share it and i am doing so.”kcho’s real name is alexis leiva machado. he became famous internationally for his painting, sculpture and drawings after winning the grand prize at a prominent art biennial in south korea. he is currently preparing for the havana biennial in may. born on one of cuba’s islands, he is known for contemporary art with rustic, seaside and patriotic themes and imagery.in the centre’s courtyard, tech-savvy young people lounge throughout the day or just sit outside when it’s crowded, tapping away on laptops and tablets or glued to their smartphones.cuba has some of the lowest connectivity rates on the planet, with dial-up accounts closely restricted and at-home broadband almost unheard of except in the case of foreigners – they pay hundreds of dollars a month for the service in a country where the average salary is between $17 and $20 a month. kcho is believed to be paying $900 a month to provide the free wi-fi.since 2013, cuban authorities have opened hundreds of internet salons, where an hour online costs $4.50, at speeds far lower than those at kcho’s studio of around 2mbps. a 2014 report found average internet connectivity speeds to be around 10.5mbps in the us and 23.6mbps in world-leading south korea. globally, the average was about 3.9mbps.with dozens of users at one time, the signal strength of kcho’s wi-fi is diluted. one user said he sometimes visits in the middle of the night, when nobody else is around, and finds it to be unbelievably fast.
intermediate	low-income countries will continue to be the most affected by human-induced climate change over the next century. they will experience gradual sea-level rises, stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rainfall, and larger and longer heatwaves, according to a recent report.the last major united nations (un) assessment, in 2007, predicted temperature rises of 6 °c or more by the end of the century. that is now thought unlikely by scientists, but average land and sea temperatures are expected to continue rising throughout this century, possibly reaching 4 °c above present levels – enough to devastate crops and make life in many cities unbearably hot.as temperatures rise and oceans warm, tropical and subtropical regions will see sharp changes in annual rainfall, says the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) report, released in stockholm and published online in september.east africa can expect increased short rainfalls and west africa should expect heavier monsoons. burma, bangladesh and india can expect stronger cyclones; elsewhere in southern asia, heavier summer rains are anticipated. indonesia may receive less rainfall between july and october, but the coastal regions around the south china sea and gulf of thailand can expect increased rainfall extremes when cyclones hit the land.“in the long term, rainfall patterns will change. northern countries, such as those in europe or north america, are expected to receive more rainfall, but many subtropical arid and semi-arid regions will likely experience less rain,” said the report’s authors.they added that the monsoon season is likely to start earlier and last longer.scientists in developing countries and commentators have welcomed the report, which they said supported their own observations.“the ipcc says that climate change is real and happening much more strongly than before. we are already seeing the effects of climate change in bangladesh and across south asia. it’s not news to us. most developing countries are facing climate change now. they do not need the ipcc to tell them that the weather is changing,” said saleemul huq, director of the international centre for climate change and development.scientists have also lowered their projections of sea-level rises. depending on future greenhouse gas emissions, sea levels will rise an average of 40–62 cm by 2100. nevertheless, there will be signifi cant geographical variations; many millions of people living in the developing world’s great cities, including lagos and calcutta, are threatened.weather disasters are also more likely in a warmer world, the report suggests. although the global frequency of tropical cyclones is expected to decrease or remain unchanged, they may become more intense, with stronger winds and heavier rainfall.life in many developing-country cities could become unbearable, especially as urban temperatures are already far above those in surrounding countryside. much higher temperatures could reduce the length of the growing period in some parts of africa by up to 20%, the report said.the charity oxfam predicted that world hunger would worsen because climate changes inevitably hurt crop production and reduce incomes. they said the number of people at risk of hunger might rise by 10% to 20% by 2050.“the changing climate is already jeopardizing gains in the fi ght against hunger, and it looks like it will get worse,” said oxfam. “a hot world is a hungry world”.nan
intermediate	the mass collection of telephone records by government surveillance programmes poses a threat to the personal privacy of ordinary people, say us researchers. they used basic phone logs to identify people and find out confidential information about their lives.with “metadata” on people’s calls and texts, but not the content of the communications, two scientists at stanford university worked out people’s names, where they lived and the names of their partners. but, that was not all.the same metadata led them to discover confidential information about some people. they discovered that one man had a gun and that another man had a heart problem. other data told them about a new pregnancy and a person with multiple sclerosis.the results show the extraordinary power of telephone metadata – that is, the number called, when and for how long – particularly when you use it together with public information from services such as google, yelp and facebook. security services know how important this data is. stewart baker, the former general counsel at the us national security agency (nsa), said “metadata tells you everything about somebody’s life.”patrick mutchler, a computer security researcher at stanford, said that the power of metadata was understood by people who collect the information but the public was in the dark. “that made it difficult for people to fight these programmes. now, we have hard evidence we can point to that we didn’t have in the past,” he said.for the study, 823 people agreed to have metadata collected from their phones through an android app. the app also received information from their facebook accounts, which the scientists used to check the accuracy of their results. in total, the researchers collected metadata on more than 250,000 calls and over 1.2m texts.mutchler describes how, with very little money, he and jonathan mayer, discovered a lot of personal information, some of it confidential, about people who took part in the study. they could find out 82% of people’s names. the same technique gave them the names of businesses the people had called. when these were marked on a map, they showed groups of local businesses, which the scientists speculated surrounded the person’s home address. in this way, they named the city people lived in 57% of the time and were nearly 90% accurate in placing people within 50 miles of their home.then, using a simple computer program to analyse people’s call patterns, the scientists could see who was in a relationship. once they knew the owner of a particular number had a partner, it was easy to find out who the partner was, they said.for the final part of the study, the researchers looked even deeper, to see what private information they could find out from telephone metadata. they collected details on calls made to and from a list of organizations, including hospitals, pharmacies, religious groups and legal services. from these, they put together some extraordinary pictures of people’s lives.one person in the study made frequent calls to a local gun shop and later made long calls to the customer support hotline of a major gun manufacturer. the metadata from two others suggested one had multiple sclerosis and the other had just become pregnant.“all of this shows what is possible with two graduate students and limited resources,” said mutchler. he says that the results should make policymakers think twice before allowing mass surveillance programmes. “metadata surveillance programmes, like the nsa’s, will reveal highly confidential information about ordinary people,” the scientists said.nannan
intermediate	loneliness has finally become a hot topic. the office for national statistics has found britain to be the loneliest place in europe. british people are less likely to have strong friendships or know their neighbours than people anywhere else in the european union. and research at the university of chicago has found that loneliness is twice as bad for older people’s health as obesity and almost as great a cause of death as poverty.this is shocking but such studies do not examine the loneliness epidemic among younger adults. in 2010, the mental health foundation found that loneliness was a greater concern among young people than among the elderly. the 18- to 34-year-olds surveyed were more likely to feel lonely often, to worry about feeling alone and to feel depressed because of loneliness than the over-55s.“loneliness is a recognized problem among the elderly and there are day centres and charities to help them,” says sam challis, of the mental health charity mind, “but, when young people reach 21, they’re too old for youth services.” this is problematic because of the close relationship between loneliness and mental health – it is linked to increased stress, depression, paranoia, anxiety, addiction and it is a known cause of suicide.but what can young people do to prevent loneliness? one researcher at the oxford internet institute points out that social media and the internet can be both a good thing and a problem. they are beneficial when they enable us to communicate with distant loved ones but not when they replace face-to-face contact. “people present an idealized version of themselves online and we expect to have social lives like those we see in the media,” says challis. comparing the perfect lives of our friends with our own lives can lead us to withdraw socially.meditation techniques and apps such as headspace are trendy solutions frequently recommended for a range of mental health problems, but they’re not necessarily helpful for loneliness, as they actively encourage us to be alone with our thoughts. “it is better to address the causes of your loneliness first – what’s stopping you going out and seeing people?” says challis.indeed, a study of social media at the university of michigan in 2013 found that using technology to help you meet new people can be beneficial. and, if you are unable to go out for some reason, the internet can help you. for example, mumsnet, an online network for parents, can help you feel less alone when bringing up young children.helplines can also reduce loneliness, at least in the short term. one in four men who call the emotional support charity samaritans mention loneliness or isolation and get connected is a free confidential helpline for young people, where they can get help with emotional and mental health problems often linked to loneliness. there are also support services on websites such as mind’s that can remind you you’re not alone.at work, it can be beneficial to tell your employer how you’re feeling. john binns advises businesses on mental health and well-being. he was admitted to hospital for stress-related depression in 2007 and took two months off work. he felt as if there was no one to talk to and wasn’t close enough to colleagues for them to notice the changes in his behaviour. more openness with his employer and colleagues made his return to work easier. office chit-chat may seem like a waste of time but it helps to protect us from the emotional and psychological effects of work strain.“we treat the networks we have as incidental but they’re fundamental to our well-being,” says nicky forsythe, a psychotherapist and the founder of talk for health, an organization that trains people to give and receive support in groups. “the most important thing is to have a regular time and place to reflect on your life and to have an empathetic listener.”if we believe recent research, loneliness is killing the elderly and, with an ageing population, we should aim to reduce our isolation before it is too late. “getting older doesn’t have to mean getting lonelier,” says ruth sutherland, the chief executive of the relationship counselling service relate. “but it is very important to lay the foundations to good-quality relationships earlier in life.”nannan
intermediate	two mothers in south africa have found out that they are raising each otherõs daughters after they were mistakenly switched at birth in a hospital in 2010.but, while one of the women wants to correct the error and get her biological child back, the other is refusing to give back the girl she has raised as her own.henk strydom, a lawyer for one of the mothers, described the swap as a travesty and tragedy that is unlikely to have a happy ending.both mothers gave birth at the tambo memorial hospital in boksburg, east of johannesburg, on the same day in 2010. ònobody suspected anything,ó strydom said.but, in 2013, one of the mothers, who is 33 and unemployed, sued her ex-partner for maintenance for her daughter. strydom said: òthe man denied he was the father. a dna test was done and it was found it was not his baby and not her baby. she was devastated. she didnõt know what to do.óeventually, she met the other mother and, since december 2013, they have been attending joint counselling sessions, arranged by the hospital. here they have met their biological daughtersstrydom said of his client: òshe said there are resemblances to herself. she told me that it was traumatic. you can see itõs not easy for her. she has to care for a child that is not hers on her own while her child is with someone else.óthe woman became unhappy with the process and asked the childrenõs court to give her custody of her biological child, but the other mother refused.òitõs a tragedy. she wants the baby back, but itõs four years later: you can understand that the other mother doesnõt want to give up her baby,ó strydom said.the high court in pretoria has asked the university of pretoriaõs centre for child law to investigate what will now be in the best interests of the children.strydom added: òi donõt know what the court will decide. your guess is as good as mine. but, whatever happens, someone wonõt be happy.óhe said, at this point, he and his client do not want to sue the hospital or government health department, which is helping with the case and providing counselling.the centre for child law will interview the mothers and fathers, as well as any other person with a òsignificant relationshipó with either of the girls. the children and mothers will have clinical assessments and may be seen by a psychologist.karabo ngidi, a lawyer with the centre, said: òwhatõs going to happen must be in the best interests of the children. biology is an important aspect but not the only one.ó the families are of zulu ethnicity and so zulu tradition, culture and customary law will be a factor, she added. it is also still possible the ex- partner of the mother who is taking legal action could be the biological father of the girl who was switched.it is not the first child-swap case in south africa. in 1995, two mothers were awarded damages after their sons, born in 1989, were accidentally switched at the johannesburg hospital where they were born.in 2009, in oregon in the united states, dee ann angell and kay rene reed discovered that they had been mistakenly mixed up at birth in 1953 when a nurse brought them back from bathing.in 2013, in japan, a 60-year-old man swapped at birth from his rich parents to a poor family was given compensation. he grew up on welfare and became a truck driver, whereas his biological brothers and sisters ð and the boy brought up in his place ð attended private secondary schools and universities.bruce laing, a clinical psychologist in johannesburg, said the long-term effects of a baby swap could be òprofoundó, òterrifyingó and òincredibly traumatizingó. he told the times of south africa: òthe parents might always be thinking ôwhat if?õó
intermediate	dr ben brabon of edgehill university teaches a mooc – a massive open online course – in literature. the course is one of only two accredited moocs currently on offer in the uk. according to brabon, many students enrol on moocs because they are free and they enjoy communicating with other students. moocs have no enrolment criteria and no fees, so students behave very differently from students on traditional higher education courses.moocs are the newest big idea to try to make higher education available to everyone. a lot of money is being invested in new online platforms that deliver sophisticated and interactive courses to tens of thousands of students. investors hope to find a business model for moocs that will make them profitable – so far, courses have depended on universities funding their star lecturers’ course design and online teaching time. one way of making a return on the investment might be studying data about how, why and when millions of students sign up, interact with their material, submit their assignments, message each other and drop out of the course.one of the questions about the future direction of moocs is that nobody can yet say who exactly they benefit. universities who want to attract fee-paying international students onto postgraduate courses by showing off their best programmes online? students in developing countries who want access to first-world universities? employees who wish to develop their professional knowledge? people without qualifications who want to use moocs as a bridge to higher education? or hobby learners, who want to learn about a subject area in which they have an interest?moocs may be popular at the beginning, but they have very poor completion rates, says brabon. his literature course had 1,000 enrolments and 31 completions. “and almost all of those had a first degree or had been educated to degree level,” he says. “so moocs may not be opening up higher education to sectors of the population it hasn’t reached yet.”“learning online is a different thing and needs quite advanced learning skills,” confirms david kernohan, progamme manager for elearning innovation at a charity that promotes the use of digital technologies in uk education and research. “with moocs, there’s very little support available: the student does not get any individual attention. instead, they get peer support, such as online discussion forums.” although this may mean that online study is unattractive or difficult for someone without high-level qualifications, it suggests, he says, that moocs could be “a really good tool for continuing education.”at a time when the number of part-time students has fallen sharply because the price of a degree is rising, could this type of open and free-to-access course provide a new path to university-level education? could an entire degree be taught via moocs? “i don’t think that’s how moocs work,” says brabon. instead, he suggests “a blended approach that combines a campus experience with a mooc; also, perhaps, using moocs to create a global degree, with students taking courses from across the world, might be possible.”but that’s a little way into the future. for now, mooc completion certificates have no quality assurance on either the course content or its assessment standards, so employers will not be impressed by them. accreditation is now essential for moocs if they want to gain credibility with academics and employers, says brabon.some people are idealistic about moocs – they want to bring the best of first-world teaching to students in less developed countries. but there’s cynicism, too, with the suggestion that universities could use moocs to advertise their on-campus courses to bigger numbers of lucrative students from outside the eu.mike sharples, chair of educational technology, doesn’t agree with that cynicism. moocs are mainly a way to publicize and share universities’ best teaching talent, as well as encouraging interaction and getting feedback from students around the world, he says. he believes that enrolling international students onto university courses is only a secondary objective of moocs – but they could certainly be a very clever marketing idea, as he observes that “if 20,000 people sign up to a mooc – well, you only need 20 of those to enrol afterwards to run a master’s.”“in south america, china and countries in africa, there is a huge appetite for learning and some of the world’s best courses are now offered online,” adds sharples. “if people are genuinely fascinated by learning, then why not? the real challenge is to allow those countries not just to study moocs, but also to create them.”nan
intermediate	he is not the first person to express scepticism about mars one, a private mission that aims to send humans to live on mars from 2025. but joseph roche is different from most critics: he’s on the shortlist of astronauts.roche, an astrophysicist at trinity college dublin who was announced in february as one of the 100 people shortlisted for the mission, has written for the guardian expressing his doubts about the viability of mars one.the selection process, roche writes, “was not rigorous enough to reach the standard of more traditional astronaut selection programmes”. he also says the dutch mars one team have shown “a certain naivety” because they believe they can succeed alone in the $6bn mission. he says they should now accept it is very unlikely to happen.roche also expressed worries about the way the mission organizers publicized a ‘top-ten’ list of candidates. the ranking, he said, didn’t mean these were the best astronauts. it was based on how many “supporter points” each had earned.he says that these points only show how much each supporter has donated to mars one, for example by buying official merchandise.the official timeline for the mission says the group plans to send a stationary lander and satellite to mars in 2018, followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022. humans would start arriving in 2025 and crews of four would be sent every two years to add to the settlement. they would not return to earth.in february, a supporter of the project, gerard ’t hooft, a dutch nobel laureate in physics, said he did not believe this timetable was realistic. he said: “it will take quite a bit longer and be quite a bit more expensive. when they first asked me to be involved, i told them: ‘you have to put a zero after everything’.”roche also said that there were not 200,000 people who applied to be astronauts, as mars one said; there were only 2,761.he talked about the selection process in more detail: “i have not met anyone from mars one in person. initially, there were going to be regional interviews; we would travel there, we’d be interviewed and we’d be tested over several days. in my mind, that sounded like a proper astronaut selection process.“but, all of a sudden, it changed from being a proper regional interview over several days to being a ten-minute skype call.”roche told the guardian that he did not want to give more interviews because he didn’t want to sound negative about the idea of space travel.he writes: “i am passionate about scientific endeavour and that is why the ambitiousness of the mars one plan appealed to me. mars one were never likely to overcome the financial and technical barriers during their proposed timeline. but it was nice to hear a new idea that challenges us to think about our own role in the future of space exploration.he said that being part of the public debate about future missions has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable aspects of his involvement with mars one. he went on to say that, “if a one-way mission to mars ever became possible, i would always volunteer. for an astrophysicist, that is not a difficult decision to make.” but he does not think there will be a one-way mission in his lifetime.nan
intermediate	not many exercise classes have a tea break halfway through. but margaret allen’s does. after a gentle warm-up and a few quick exercises, the 93-year-old great-grandmother lets her group relax with a cup of tea and a quick rest.some of the class of eight look as if they need to rest more than others. allen herself, wearing a thick shirt, knitted waistcoat, slacks and sensible shoes, is not even sweating. despite an extremely painful trapped nerve in one leg and a knee in need of replacement, she looks like she could go on for hours.the general rule is that eating just before doing sport is not a good idea and especially not halfway through the class. but, on the afternoon i visit allen’s class in saltburn-by-the-sea near middlesbrough, slices of fruitcake are being passed around during the break. the cake has been baked to celebrate allen’s recent birthday by her 89-year-old sister, joan.the ladies have just finished their cake when allen is up again, leading the group through a lively scottish tune with lots of toe pointing and leg kicking. forty-five minutes later, the class is finally over.allen, a former volunteer with the charity red cross, has been leading classes in the north-east town for 45 years. she wasn’t particularly sporty at school, but she started playing the piano for a keep-fit class during the second world war and eventually took over in her 40s when the previous instructor retired.at one time, allen’s class had more than 18 regulars, each paying £1 a time. but, these days, the group is getting smaller – during the tea break, the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them had attended that week for one of the younger members of the group who had just died, aged 68.allen is the oldest, followed by her sister. the baby of the group is 60-year-old jean cunion, who is a bit embarrassed to admit that she is perhaps the least fit of the group. “i remember, the first time i came, margaret said, ‘who’s that huffing and panting?’ and i had to admit it was me.” ruth steere, 76, says allen always knows what’s going on, although her back is always to the class: “she always shouts at us if we go wrong. she’s remarkably good at knowing what we are doing.”allen, a keen dancer, has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor. instead, she choreographs her own moves based on five tapes from the bbc’s first ever fitness guru, eileen fowler. allen thinks her good health is largely a result of keeping busy, especially since her husband died in 1997. she started writing poetry when she was 80.“i write poems about everything. i’m a prolific writer. i just can’t stop,” she says, when she phones me a few days after the interview to read out a poem she has written about the joys of exercise. one of the class, 84-year-old former teacher winnie robertson, thinks the secret to staying fit is never letting yourself go: “use it or lose it, that’s what i say.”allen still plays the piano and gives speeches. she did a computer course when she was 88. ageing is no fun, she admits, reading me a few lines from a poem she has written called ‘that beast called age’. she happily remembers a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years ago, who said she couldn’t possibly be more than 78: “i said, ‘thank you, doctor. you can go now.’”she also has a no-nonsense attitude to weight gain: “i just think people shouldn’t eat too much. whenever i hear someone saying, ‘oh, i can’t lose weight’, i say: ‘sellotape.’” she mimes taping her mouth shut. “i said this just the other day to a big fat man. everything in moderation is my motto.”earlier in 2013, allen was watching the news and saw a woman being given the british empire medal. “she was saying: ‘i’m 80 and i’m the oldest fitness instructor in the country!’ i was thinking: ‘no, you’re not.’ but i shan’t be writing to buckingham palace.”nan
elementary	coal will probably rival oil as the world’s biggest source of energy in the next five years. this might be a disaster for the climate.one of the biggest reasons behind the rise in coal use is the big increase in the use of shale gas in the us.new research from the international energy agency (iea) shows that all over the world people are using more coal, except in the us, where shale gas is now more popular than coal. because the us is using less coal, coal prices across the world have reduced. this has made coal more attractive, even in europe.maria van der hoeven, executive director of the iea, said that the amount of coal we use “continues to grow each year and, if no changes are made, coal will catch oil within ten years.”coal is available in large amounts and it can be found in most regions of the world, unlike oil and gas, and it is cheap to extract. the iea says that china and india will drive world coal use in the next five years, and india will probably overtake the us as the world’s second biggest consumer. china is the biggest coal importer, and indonesia is the biggest coal exporter.according to the iea’s medium-term coal market report, the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today.with the highest carbon emissions, coal makes climate change a lot worse, especially when it is burned in old-fashioned, inefficient power stations. coal can also produce sulphur emissions – these lead to acid rain – and mercury and soot-particle pollution.van der hoeven says that we should make coal more expensive so that people prefer to use cleaner technologies such as renewable power. providing cheaper gas is the only way to reduce demand for coal. this has happened in the us because of the big increase in the production of shale gas there in the past five years.she said: “the us experience suggests that a more efficient gas market can reduce coal use, carbon dioxide emissions and electricity bills. europe, china and other regions should take note.”if something isn’t done soon there will be more climate change.nannan
elementary	more than 100,000 people went onto the streets in brazil to show their anger at violent police, poor public services and high costs for the world cup.the demonstrations in rio de janeiro, são paulo, brasilia, belem, belo horizonte and salvador started peacefully, but there were some clashes with police and people set fire to cars and buses.people complained that police used rubber bullets, tear gas and violent beatings.happening at the start of the football confederations cup, the rallies brought together people who are angry with the high costs and poor quality of public services, the large amounts of money spent on international sporting events, low standards of health care, inequality and corruption.most of the demonstrations were peaceful, but several police were hurt, at least one car was burned and windows were broken.people were demonstrating for different reasons. “we are here because we hate the government. they do nothing for us,” said oscar josé santos, 19 years old.“i’m an architect but i have been unemployed for six months. there must be something wrong with this country,” said nadia al husin.at a smaller rally in brasilia, demonstrators entered the high-security area of the national congress. several climbed onto the roof.in belo horizonte, police clashed with protesters who tried to get into a football stadium, where there was a confederations cup match between nigeria and tahiti.in porto alegre, demonstrators set fire to a bus and, in curitiba, protesters tried to enter the office of the state governor. there were also rallies in belem, salvador and other places.in são paulo, there were large groups of people but the marches were peaceful.most protesters were young and, for many, it was their first experience of such a giant rally. “my generation has never experienced this,” said thiago firbida, a student. “since the dictatorship, brazilians have never demonstrated like this. they did not believe they had a reason to. but now brazil once again has problems, with a constant rise in prices, so people are finally reacting.”brazil’s demonstrations have been given special names – the “vinegar revolution” (because police arrested people for carrying vinegar to stop the effects of tear gas), the “20-cent revolution” (because of the bus price rise) and the passe livre (because of the demand for free public transport).some said the protests did not feel brazilian but they were liberating. “our politicians need to see the strength we have as one people. brazilians are usually too nice; they enjoy partying, not protesting, but something is changing,” said deli borsari, a 53-year-old yoga teacher.after people heard about the costs of new and improved stadiums on the news, the confederations cup football tournament has been one of the reasons for the protests. before saturday’s match in brasilia, groups of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police. frightened japanese supporters ran from the area holding their children, when they heard shots – perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas.another protest march, near rio’s maracana stadium, also had a heavy police response.president dilma rousseff “believes peaceful protests are correct and proper for a democracy and that it is natural for young people to demonstrate.”but people booed the president at the opening ceremony for the confederations cup. she will have serious political problems, both now and in 2014, when brazil will host the world cup and also have an election.nannannannan
elementary	the brand and logo of apple are the most valuable in the world. they are worth nearly $119 billion – that is more than the economies of morocco, ecuador or oman.the brand value of apple, the world’s biggest company, has increased by 21% in 12 months, the interbrand best global brands report said.people all around the world recognize apple by its simple “apple with a bite missing” logo. other technology companies have also done very well in the 2014 report. the technology companies pushed more traditional brands – such as coca-cola, mcdonald’s and gillette – down the table.google’s brand value rose by 15% to $107 billion to take second place. coca-cola, in third place, is up 3% to $81.5 billion. ibm’s value is $72.2 billion and microsoft’s $45.5 billion. they are in fourth and fifth places.facebook’s value has increased the most in the table. its brand value increased by 86% to $14.3 billion. it is at 29th place in the table, ahead of older global companies such as volkswagen, kellogg’s and ford.apple was started by steve jobs in his los altos garage in 1976. it only appeared in the top ten of the interbrand annual study in 2011.its logo was created by advertising executive rob janoff in 1977. it was designed with a bite taken out of it so that it would not look like a cherry.graham hayles, interbrand’s chief marketing officer, said, “apple makes a lot of money because it has a very strong brand. if you have a strong brand, you make more money.”many technology companies rose up the chart but some fell, too. finnish mobile-phone company nokia dropped 41 places to 98th at $4.1 billion, just ahead of nintendo in 100th place (down 33).a chinese company has appeared in the top 100 for the first time, with mobile-phone and broadband company huawei at 94th place. it has a brand value of $4.3 billion.most of the brands in the top 100 are american. the most valuable non-american brands are south korea’s samsung (6th), japan’s toyota (8th) and germany’s mercedes-benz (10th). the most valuable british brands are hsbc (33rd), shell (65th) and burberry (73rd).other fashion brands in the top 100 include boss, prada and ralph lauren. designer label louis vuitton is the top fashion name, in 19th position with a value of $23 billion, just ahead of clothing chain h&m, with a brand value of $21 billion in place 21.sports brand nike is at place 22 with a brand value of nearly $20 billion, ahead of its rival adidas at place 59 with a value of $7 billion.jez frampton, chief executive of interbrand, said that customers now have more control than ever over a brand’s reputation. this is because they can make comments about a brand on social media, such as twitter.“customers expect interaction, 24/7 accessibility, customization options and high levels of personalization,” he said.nannannan
elementary	prince harry has left afghanistan at the end of a four-month tour. he spoke about the frustrations of being a royal who doesn’t want a lot of public attention.he also talked about his feelings for some parts of the media and described how his father constantly told him to behave more like a member of the royal family.as a commander of an apache helicopter, the prince said he had shot at the taliban. he said he was only doing his job.in interviews during his time based at camp bastion in helmand province, the prince, known as captain wales in the army, explained his ‘three mes’. “one in the army, one socially in my own private time and one with the family.”he admitted he sometimes disappointed people and also himself with his silly behaviour. he said he was “probably too much army and not enough prince”, but he said he was entitled to privacy, too.in another interview, he criticized the media, especially the sun, the daily mail and the daily telegraph. he said he was very annoyed by articles that compare his role as an apache co-pilot gunner to spitfire crews during the second world war. “no, it’s not like that at all,” he said.the prince said he didn’t like the media because of the treatment of his family when “i was very small”. he said that he read the stories written about him. “of course i read them,” the prince said. “if there’s a story and somebody writes something about me, i want to know what they said. but it just upsets me and makes me angry that people can write those things. not just about me, but about everything and everybody. my father always says, ‘don’t read it’.”when he was asked if he felt more comfortable being captain wales than prince harry, his reply was revealing. “definitely. i’ve always been like that. my father’s always trying to tell me about who i am and things like that. but it’s very easy to forget about who i am when i am in the army. everyone’s wearing the same uniform and doing the same kind of thing. i get on well with the lads and i enjoy my job. it really is as simple as that.”before he went to afghanistan, the prince was photographed naked in las vegas at a private party. harry said he had disappointed himself and other people, but also blamed the media. “at the end of the day i was in a private area and there should be a certain amount of privacy that one should expect.”when he was asked why he and his brother liked helicopters, he said, “probably because you can only fit a few people in a helicopter, so no one can follow us, like you guys.”nannannan
elementary	clay cockrell is sitting in his of ce opposite the trump international hotel and tower. in front of the tower is central park, where cockrell holds his popular walk and talk therapy sessions.cockrell is a former wall street worker who is now a therapist. he spends large parts of his days walking in central park or the battery park in downtown manhattan near wall street, talking to some of new yorkõs wealthiest people.òmany of the very wealthy ð the 1% of the 1% ð feel that their problems are really not problems. but they are,ó he says.so, what problems do americaõs 1% have? òthere is guilt that they are rich,ó he said. òthere is the feeling that they have to hide that they are rich. and, then, there is the isolation ð being in the 1% can be lonely.ócounsellors say that things have become worse since the  nancial crisis in 2008. people now talk about the gap between rich and poor more because of groups like occupy wall street.òoccupy wall street had some important things to say about the gap between rich and poor but it was negative about the 1%,ó said jamie traeger-muney, a wealth psychologist. the media, she said, makes the rich òfeel like they need to hide or feel ashamedó.òsometimes, i am shocked by things that people say. you would never talk about another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to talk about wealthy people.óòitõs really isolating to have a lot of money. peopleõs reaction to you can be scary,ó said barbara nusbaum, an expert in money psychology. òwe are all taught not to talk about money. itõs not polite to talk about money. but itõs harder to talk about being rich than it is to talk about being poor. people donõt mind if you say ôi am broke. things are hard.õ you canõt say ôi have a ton of money.õ you have to keep a lot of your life private.óas a result, cockrell says, the rich hang out with other rich americans who understand them and their problems.in the us, over the last 30 years, the number of very wealthy people has grown. in 2014, the number of us households with $1m or more ð excluding the value of their main home ð was 10.1 million. there were 1.3 million households worth $5 million and 142,000 worth $25 million or more.since the 2008  nancial crisis, the gap between the rich and the poor has grown and the situation òhas gotten worse for the wealthyó, cockrell said. the main reason? not knowing if your friends are friends with you or with your money.òsomeone else who is also a billionaire ð they donõt want anything from you. never being able to trust your friendships with other people, i think that is dif cult,ó said cockrell.òwealth can stop you from connecting with other people,ó said the wife of a man who made about $80 million. some americans keep their wealth secret.òthere are a lot of people hiding their wealth because they are worried about negative judgment,ó said traeger-muney. if wealthy americans talk about their problems, people donõt have a lot of sympathy,ó she said.cockrell said that there is a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make ð they let their money be the most important thing in their lives.òif you are part of the 1%, you still have problems. there are other parts of your life. money is not the only thing,ó he said. òyour problems are real.ónannannannan

elementary	from all across rwanda, and even from burundi, people are coming to the southern town of butare to a little shop called inzozi nziza (sweet dreams). they come for a taste of something new, something most of them have never tasted before ð sweet, cold ice cream.here, at the central african countryõs  rst ice-cream shop, customers can buy ice cream in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple  avours. toppings include fresh fruit, honey, chocolate chips and granola. they can also buy black tea and coffee.the shop, which has òice cream, coffee, dreamsó written on its signs, is taking advantage of local peopleõs curiosity about ice cream ð and the shop is also òchanging livesó, says inzozi nzizaõs manager, louise ingabire.òice cream is important,ó she says between mouthfuls of honey- avoured ice cream. òsome rwandans like ice cream, but itõs a new thing. we still have some work to do, to tell others that theyõll enjoy it.óthe shop can certainly make dreams come true. òi didnõt have a job before: i just stayed at home. now, i have a vision for the future. i am making money and i can give some of it to my family,ó says the 27-year-old.butare has 89,600 residents and is 135km south of the capital, kigali. it is the home of the national university of rwanda. inzozi nziza has become a meeting place for students who want to treat themselves to something cool and different.òthe shop is uniting people here,ó kalisa migendo, a 24-year-old student, says. òif you need to go out and talk to a friend, a girl or a boy, you come to inzozi nziza for an ice cream.óinzozi nziza was opened by odile gakire katese. she met alexis miesen and jennie dundas, co- founders of blue marble ice cream in brooklyn, new york. the three women formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010.at the start, miesen and dundas owned the shop in partnership with its employees and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative. after 18 months, they gave their shares to the women employees, who by then could control the business by themselves. ice cream is new to rwanda. selling and eating ice cream is not part of the rwandan culture.the butare shop employs nine women. they spend their free time practising with ingoma nshya, rwandaõs  rst and only female drumming group.the musicians are hutu and tutsi women. some are survivors of the 1994 genocide, when almost a million tutsis and hutus were killed. some members of ingoma nshya are widows, some orphans.ingabireõs father, two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide. òwhen iõm drumming, it gives me power because weõre still alive and survivors,ó she says.the ice-cream shop is in a documentary by  lm-makers rob and lisa fruchtman. sweet dreams, which tells the story of how the women have made a positive future after the genocide, also includes the female drummers.the  lm has been shown in many countries, including the us, uk and several african states. òwe feel the  lm is about hope, bravery and the ability to change your life,ó says lisa fruchtman.nannannannannan
elementary	japanese entrepreneur takahito iguchi thinks google glasses are not cool. he may be right. there’s already a website with pictures of people wearing them – the people look ridiculous or smug or, more often, both. if you search google images for google glasses, one of the first pictures is of a large, naked man wearing them in the shower. iguchi hopes that this is google’s weak point. he has designed some glasses that are a bit more stylish and a bit more japanese.iguchi’s glasses aren’t really glasses – they are a piece of metal with a camera and a very small projector. the glasses are called telepathy one. since he first presented them to the public in texas, they have attracted $5 million from investors. like glass, you will be able to buy telepathy one in 2014.it’s a more simple version of google glass. glass has many uses – you can surf the internet, read emails, take photographs – but telepathy will be “more of a communication machine”. connected to your phone, it will allow real-time visual and audio sharing. you’ll be able to post photos and videos of what you see on facebook or send them as an email. or see and speak to a video image of a friend.“it will help bring you close to your friends and family. we are very focused on the communication and sharing possibilities,” says iguchi, who has worked in the japanese technology industry for 20 years. “i’m a visionary,” he says. “i have a dream that people will understand other people. when i go to london, i am a stranger. but i believe that everyone wants people to understand them and to understand other people. and, with the glasses, you can know more information about people before you even speak to them.”when iguchi was growing up, japanese technology ruled the world: they had the sony walkman, which was as popular as the iphone. now, to compete, he has had to leave tokyo and go to silicon valley. “tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture, but it’s still an island. it’s isolated. there is no way to expand. but, in silicon valley, everyone is from everywhere. it’s where you come to connect with the world.” they will make the glasses in japan and the software in the us.it was easy to build the prototype of telepathy one, iguchi says. “we have every sort of technology in tokyo. the problem is presenting it to the world.” the top manufacturers all want to work with him, he says, because they have the technology, they just find it difficult to sell it. “there needs to be a story to the product. apple had a story with the ipod – 1,000 songs in your pocket. and steve jobs was inspired by akio morita, the co-founder of sony, and he inspired me, so maybe it will come in a circle.”like steve jobs, iguchi is a confident man, but his strong japanese accent makes it difficult to understand him. it is possible that this fact helped him to find the idea for telepathy one. when he visited london, he stayed with someone he didn’t know. “he was not my friend, but i talked with him for three hours, and now he is my friend. that is how long it takes to understand each other, to share our feelings, and background, and career. maybe telepathy makes that quicker. if you are getting information from the cloud and social networks, that will happen more easily.”iguchi hopes that telepathy one will help people see other people’s point of view. as a student, he explains, he studied philosophy during the day and taught himself how to code at night. “and, one day, i opened the door of my apartment and i suddenly realized that everything is code. everything is coded and can be shared between humans. and everything can be encoded and decoded. and, if code can be exchanged between humans, that will end all war.”nannan
elementary	there are many quirky solutions to help make our cities better places to live, such as glow-in-the-dark trees, underground bike sheds and solar-powered bins. city living is good in many ways but it is not always possible to lead a sustainable lifestyle in a city. pollution, traf c and loss of green spaces are just some of the daily problems that people in cities have to live with. we look at ten quirky solutions that could make our cities better places to live.pop-up parks todayõs cities sometimes look like theyõre built for cars and not for people. the pop-up park is a simple idea. you need an empty car park, a small amount of money and a plant or two, and you can make your own private park. the park(ing) project started as an arts experiment in san francisco. it has since spread across the world.underground storage not everyone in a city has a car. bikes are in fashion but there is one problem: where to keep the bike safe? an engineering company in tokyo has a solution: an underground bicycle park. just seven metres wide, the bicycle park goes deep enough into the ground to keep 204 bikes.glow-in-the-dark trees when most people think of trees that glow in the dark, they usually think of christmas trees. not daan roosegaarde. the dutch designer-artist has invented a plant that is like a light. the technology joins dna from glowing marine bacteria with a plant to create a glow like a jelly sh. roosegaarde hopes that this technology could one day replace normal street lighting. pedestrian electricity every day, hundreds of people in the east london neighbourhood of west ham cross a pedestrian walkway close to the underground station. they probably donõt notice the springiness of the walkway. and they probably donõt know that the springy rubber surface powers the streetlights above. the  oor has tiles that capture the energy from pedestriansõ footsteps and turn it into electricity. there is a similar system at londonõs heathrow airport. supertrees singaporeõs gardens by the bay has a group of man-made trees. up to 50 metres high, these steel ôsupertreesõ have  owers growing up them. they collect rainwater and 11 of the 18 trees also have solar panels on their ôbranchesõ.
elementary	do you want your child to be good at sport, play for the school team and, maybe one day, even be in international competitions? well, try to make sure that your child is born in november or october. a study by a top expert on childrenõs physical activity has found that schoolchildren born in november or october are  tter than everyone else in their class.children born in november or october were  tter, stronger and more powerful than children born in the other ten months of the year. they are especially  tter, stronger and more powerful than children with birthdays in april or june. dr gavin sandercock of essex university and his colleagues found that children born in the autumn had òa clear physical advantageó over their classmates.the research involved 8,550 boys and girls aged between ten and 16 from 26 state schools in essex. all were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different things: stamina, handgrip strength and lower-body power. the results showed that a childõs month of birth could make big differences to their levels of  tness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate, all of which predict how good someone is at sport.november children were the  ttest because they had the most stamina and power and were the second strongest. children born in october were almost as  t ð they scored highest for strength and came third for power, with december children close behind.the gap in physical ability between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide. òfor example, we found that a boy born in november can run at least 10% faster, jump 12% higher and is 15% more powerful than a child of the same age born in april. this is a huge physical advantage,ó said sandercock. these gaps could decide who became a top-level athlete because òselection into elite sports may often depend on very small differences in a personõs physical performanceó.the study found that, when scores for the three kinds of  tness were put together, children born in april were the least  t, followed by children born in june. the  ndings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a double òautumn advantageó ð we already know that they have an academic advantage and, now, they also seem to be better at sport, too.the authors of the study believe that the most likely explanation is that children born in autumn get more vitamin d over the summer months towards the end of pregnancy. john steele, chief executive of the youth sport trust, said the quality of a young personõs introduction to sport at school can be òa major factoró in their sporting development. òchildren that get a high-quality  rst experience will have greater agility, balance and coordination, and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and be good at sport as they grow upó, he said.uk sport could not say if a majority of the 1,300 athletes it gives money to were born in november and october. natalie dunman, its head of performance, said that the differences shown in the new study were true for teenagers in junior-level competitions, but that the differences disappear before sportspeople were in adult competitions. she said: òwith adult athletes, there are many factors that make a champion and we donõt think that month of birth is one of the key ingredients.ónannannan
advanced	scientists have connected the brains of a pair of animals and allowed them to share sensory information in a major step towards what the researchers call the world’s first “organic computer”.the us team fitted two rats with devices called brain-to-brain interfaces that let the animals collaborate on simple tasks to earn rewards, such as a drink of water. in one radical demonstration of the technology, the scientists used the internet to link the brains of two rats separated by thousands of miles, with one in the researchers’ lab at duke university in durham, north carolina, and the other in natal, brazil.led by miguel nicolelis, a pioneer of devices that allow paralyzed people to control computers and robotic arms with their thoughts, the researchers say their latest work may enable multiple brains to be hooked up to share information. “these experiments showed that we have established a sophisticated, direct communication linkage between brains,” nicolelis said in a statement. “basically, we are creating what i call an organic computer.”the scientists first demonstrated that rats can share, and act on, each other’s sensory information by electrically connecting their brains via tiny grids of electrodes that reach into the motor cortex, the brain region that processes movement.the rats were trained to press a lever when a light went on above it. when they performed the task correctly, they got a drink of water. to test the animals’ ability to share brain information, they put the rats in two separate compartments. only one compartment had a light that came on above the lever. when the rat pressed the lever, an electronic version of its brain activity was sent directly to the other rat’s brain. in trials, the second rat responded correctly to the imported brain signals 70% of the time by pressing the lever.remarkably, the communication between the rats the rats collaborated on a task that required them to distinguish between narrow and wide openings using their whiskers. was two-way. if the receiving rat failed at the task, the first rat was not rewarded with a drink, and appeared to change its behaviour to make the task easier for its partner. in further experiments,in the final test, the scientists connected rats on different continents and beamed their brain activity back and forth over the internet. “even though the animals were on different continents, with the resulting noisy transmission and signal delays, they could still communicate,” said miguel pais-vieira, the first author of the study. “this tells us that we could create a workable network of animal brains distributed in many different locations.”nicolelis said the team is now working on ways to link several animals’ brains at once to solve more complex tasks. “we cannot even predict what kinds of emergent properties would appear when animals begin interacting as part of a ‘brain-net’,” he said. “in theory, you could imagine that a combination of brains could provide solutions that individual brains cannot achieve by themselves.” the research is published in the journal scientific reports.anders sandberg, who studies the ethics of neurotechnologies at the future of humanity institute at oxford university, said the work was “very important” in helping to understand how brains encode information. but the implications of the technology and its potential future uses are far broader, said sandberg. “the main reason we are running the planet is that we are amazingly good at communicating and coordinating. without that, although we are very smart animals, we would not dominate the planet.”“i don’t think there’s any risk of supersmart rats from this,” he added. “there’s a big difference between sharing sensory information and being able to plan. i’m not worried about an imminent invasion of ‘rat multiborgs’.”very little is known about how thoughts are encoded and how they might be transmitted into another person’s brain, so that is not a realistic prospect any time soon. and much of what is in our minds is what sandberg calls a “draft” of what we might do. “often, we don’t want to reveal those drafts; that would be embarrassing and confusing. and a lot of those drafts are changed before we act. most of the time i think we’d be very thankful not to be in someone else’s head.”
advanced	the senate intelligence committee has approved a bill that would provide for increased transparency of the national security agency’s bulk collection of us phone records but allow the controversial practice to continue. sponsored by chairwoman dianne feinstein, the bill lets the nsa continue to collect phone metadata of millions of americans for renewable 90-day periods and allows the government to retain it. some legislators have alternatively proposed letting phone companies hold the metadata. it passed the committee by an 11-4 vote, paving the way for a full senate vote.the bill allows analysts to search through the data if they suspect there is a ‘reasonable suspicion’ that a suspect is associated with international terrorism. additionally, the bill allows the nsa to continue surveillance begun on foreigners outside the us if they enter the country ‘for a transitory period not to exceed 72 hours’.the bill is a direct challenge to one introduced by senator patrick leahy that would end domestic phone-records collection. it was also opposed by leading intelligence committee member mark udall, who said it did not go far enough. “the nsa’s invasive surveillance of americans’ private information does not respect our constitutional values and needs fundamental reform, not incidental changes. unfortunately, the bill passed by the senate intelligence committee does not go far enough to address the nsa’s overreaching domestic surveillance programmes,” udall said.another democratic member of the committee, ron wyden, said the bill maintains “business as usual” and “remains far from anything that could be considered meaningful reform”. feinstein defended the nsa bulk collection programme, but said there was a need to rebuild public trust. “the nsa call-records programme is legal and subject to extensive congressional and judicial oversight, and i believe it contributes to our national security,” she said in a statement. “but more can, and should, be done to increase transparency and build public support for privacy protections in place.”in her statement, feinstein said the bill would also make a number of improvements to transparency and oversight on the nsa, including: • requiring an annual public report of the total number of queries of nsa’s telephone metadata database and the number of times the programme leads to an fbi investigation or probable cause order; • requiring that the foreign intelligence surveillance court impose limits on the number of people at nsa who may authorize or query the call-records database; • establishing criminal penalties of up to ten years in prison for intentional unauthorized access to data acquired under the foreign intelligence surveillance act (fisa) by the united states; • mandating the fisa court impose a limit on the number of contacts an analyst can receive in response to a query of bulk communication records.after the committee’s hearing had ended, feinstein strongly endorsed the nsa’s main domestic programme. “i think there’s huge misunderstanding about this nsa database programme, and how vital it is to protecting this country,” she told reporters.concern over the intelligence committee’s bill was expressed by independent legal experts, who said the stage was now set for a showdown with the usa freedom act, a bill introduced by leahy and jim sensenbrenner that would prohibit bulk collection of americans’ telephone records. elizabeth goitein of the brennan center for justice said: “the intelligence committee bill and the usa freedom act present two opposing visions of the relationship between law-abiding americans and the national security state. the fundamental question is: should the government have some reason to suspect wrongdoing before sweeping up americans’ most personal information to feed into its databases? leahy and sensenbrenner say yes; feinstein says no.”wyden suggested that recent concern about nsa spying on foreign leaders had distracted from the real focus on mass domestic surveillance in the us. “the statements that american intelligence officials have made about collecting on the intentions of foreign leadership, that’s consistent with the understanding i’ve had for years, as a member of the intelligence committee,” he said. “that has implications for foreign policy. my top priority is ending the mass surveillance, digital surveillance, of millions and millions of lawabiding americans.”feinstein unexpectedly announced that she was “totally opposed” to the foreign leader spying of the sort the nsa conducts of german chancellor angela merkel. feinstein has been a staunch supporter of the nsa’s bulk collection of americans’ phone records.“americans are making it clear, that they never – repeat, never – agreed to give up their constitutional liberties for the appearance of security,” wyden said. “we’re just going to keep fighting this battle. it’s going to be a long one.”separately, feinstein said that james clapper, the director of national intelligence, had agreed to provide her in writing with a statement about a washington post story that alleged the nsa had intercepted data in transmission between google and yahoo data centres. she said she was withholding judgement on the story until she saw clapper’s rebuttal. her strong endorsement of the domestic phone records collection indicates that the powerful senate democrat is not yet prepared to expand the criticism of the nsa that she has launched, “totally opposing” its surveillance of foreign allied leaders – a more traditional intelligence activity than bulk phone metadata surveillance.wyden would not comment on the washington post report on the google and yahoo intercepts. but the senators suggested it had implications for the privacy of americans’ communication. “decades ago, countries had their own kinds of communication systems. now that you’ve had the merger of global communications, i think you’re going to have a lot more challenges spying on foreigners with implications for us citizens,” wyden said.
advanced	the threatened extinction of the tiger in india, the perilous existence of the orangutan in indonesia, the plight of the panda: these are wildlife emergencies with which we have become familiar. they are well-loved animals that no one wants to see disappear. but, now, scientists fear the real impact of declining wildlife could be closer to home, with the threat to creatures such as ladybirds posing the gravest danger to biodiversity.climate change, declining numbers of animals, rising numbers of humans and the rapid rate of species extinction mean a growing number of scientists now declare us to be in the anthropocene – the geological age of extinction when humans finally dominate the ecosystems.wwf’s living planet index (lpi) 2014 seemed to confirm that grim picture, with statistics on the world’s wildlife population that showed a dramatic reduction in numbers across countless species. the lpi showed the number of vertebrates had declined by 52% over four decades. biodiversity loss has now reached “critical levels”. some populations of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians have suffered even bigger losses, with freshwater species declining by 76% over the same period. but it’s the creatures that provide the most “natural capital” or “ecosystem services” that are getting many scientists really worried. three quarters of the world’s food production is thought to depend on bees and other pollinators such as hoverflies. never mind how cute a panda is or how stunning a tiger – it’s worms that are grinding up our waste and taking it deep into the soil to turn into nutrients, and bats that are catching mosquitoes and keeping malaria rates down. a study in north america has valued the loss of pest control from ongoing bat declines at more than $22bn in lost agricultural productivity.“it’s the loss of the common species that will impact on people, not so much the rarer creatures because, by the very nature of their rarity, we’re not reliant on them in such an obvious way,” said dr nick isaac, a macroecologist at the centre for ecology & hydrology in oxfordshire. he says that recent work he and colleagues have been doing suggests that britain’s insects and other invertebrates are declining just as fast as vertebrates, with “serious consequences for humanity”. “the really interesting thing about this work is that we are learning that it’ s not just about the numbers of species going extinct, but the actual numbers in a population; that’ s the beginning of a fundamental shift in our understanding,” he says.he pointed to the fact that between 23 and 36% of all birds, mammals and amphibians used for food or medicine are now threatened with extinction. in many parts of the world, wildanimal food sources are a critical part of the diet, particularly for the poor.the blame, most agree, sits with unsustainable human consumption damaging ecosystems, creating climate change and destroying habitats at a far faster rate than previously thought. but, this time, it’s not just the “big, cuddly mammals” we have to worry about losing but the smaller, less visible creatures upon which we depend – insects, creepycrawlies and even worms. they might not be facing immediate extinction but a decline in their numbers will affect us all. “we are going to feel the impact of those losses. with the uk species, the pattern is much the same with invertebrates as it is with vertebrates. it’s not as simplistic as ‘fish die and people starve’ – it’s more complex,” said isaac.humans, said tv naturalist sir david attenborough in 2013, are a “plague on earth”, but wwf claims there is still time to stop the rot. its uk chief executive, david nussbaum, said: “the scale of the destruction highlighted in this report should act as a wake-up call for us all. we all – politicians, business and people – have an interest, and a responsibility, to act to ensure we protect what we all value: a healthy future for people and nature.“humans are cutting down trees more quickly than they can regrow, harvesting more fish than the oceans can restock, pumping water from our rivers and aquifers faster than rainfall can replenish them and emitting more carbon than the oceans and forests can absorb,” he said.
advanced	when two islanders spotted a small fibreglass boat washed up on a remote pacific atoll, they decided to take a closer look. what they found inside was a tale of adventure and unlikely survival to rival the blockbuster book and film life of pi: an emaciated man with long hair and a beard, who claimed to have been drifting for 16 months after setting out from mexico, more than 12,500km away.the man, dressed only in a ragged pair of underpants, told his rescuers that he had been adrift in the 7.3-metre fibreglass boat, whose engines were missing their propellers, since he left mexico for el salvador in september 2012. a companion had died at sea several months earlier, he said.“his condition isn’t good, but he’s getting better,” said ola fjeldstad, a norwegian anthropology student doing research on the isolated ebon atoll, part of the marshall islands archipelago. the man had said his name was josé ivan and he had indicated that he survived by catching turtles and birds with his bare hands, but, because he spoke only spanish, further details were sketchy. there was no fishing equipment on the boat, but a turtle was inside when it washed up. “the boat is really scratched up and looks like it has been in the water for a long time,” fjeldstad told reporters.according to the researcher, the islanders who found the man took him to the main island in the atoll – which is so remote it has only one phone line and no internet – to meet the mayor, ione de brum, who contacted the ministry of foreign affairs in majuro, the marshall islands capital. officials at the ministry said that they were awaiting more details and expected the man to be taken to the capital.the government airline’s only plane that can land at ebon is currently undergoing maintenance and is not expected to return to service for several days. officials are considering sending a boat to pick up the castaway. “he’s staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him,” said fjeldstad, who added that the man had a basic health check and was found to have low blood pressure, but did not appear to have any life-threatening conditions and was able to walk with the aid of men on the island. “we’ve been giving him a lot of water and he’s gaining strength.”fraser christian, who teaches maritime survival courses at his coastal survival school in dorset, said the man’s story, if true, would be remarkable but far from unique. it was entirely possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand, he said, since “they are inquisitive and they will approach a small boat to shelter underneath it”. christian advises clients who find themselves forced to eat turtles to start with their eyes – “lots of fluid” – then move on to the blood.the major problems the man would have faced were exposure and dehydration. “the basic rule is: no water, no food. you need water to digest protein. if you have no fresh water and it doesn’t rain for a few days, so you can’t collect rainwater, you have basically had it.” individual physiology also plays a part, he said, with some people better suited to survival than others. “the mental thing is key and that’s often down to people’s situation in life and how used they are to dealing mentally with hardship.”stories of survival in the vast pacific ocean are not uncommon. in 2006, three mexicans made international headlines when they were discovered drifting, also in a small fibreglass boat near the marshall islands. they claimed to have survived for nine months at sea on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds, with their hope kept alive by reading the bible. but cliff downing, who teaches sea survival to sailors, said he was sceptical about the latest tale. “it just doesn’t sound right to me. there are 1,001 hazards that would make his survival for so long very unlikely. one would want to know a lot more.”
advanced	more than a third of all women worldwide – 35.6% – will experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, usually from a male partner, according to the first comprehensive study of its kind from the world health organization (who). the report reveals the shocking extent of attacks on women from the men with whom they share their lives, with 30% of women being attacked by partners. it also finds that a large proportion of murders of women – 38% – are carried out by intimate partners.“these findings send a powerful message that violence against women is a global health problem of epidemic proportions,” said dr margaret chan, director general of the who. “we also see that the world’s health systems can and must do more for women who experience violence.”the highest levels of violence against women are in africa, where nearly half of all women – 45.6% – will suffer physical or sexual violence. in low- and middle-income europe, the proportion is 27.2%. yet, wealthier nations are not necessarily always safer for women – a third of women in high-income countries (32.7%) will experience violence at some stage in their lives. of the women who suffer violence, 42% sustain injuries, which can bring them to the attention of healthcare staff. that, says the report, is often the first opportunity for violence in the home to be detected and for the woman to be offered help. violence has a profound effect on women’s health. some arrive at hospital with broken bones, while others suffer pregnancy-related complications and mental illness.the two reports from the who – one on the prevalence of violence, the other offering guidelines to healthcare staff on helping women – are the work of dr claudia garcia-moreno, lead specialist in gender, reproductive rights, sexual health and adolescence at who, and professor charlotte watts, an epidemiologist who specializes in gender, violence and health, from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine.“for the first time, we have compared data from all over the world on the magnitude of partner violence and sexual violence by non-partners and the impact of these sorts of violence on health,” said garcia-moreno. these included hiv and other sexually transmitted infections, depression, women turning to alcohol, unwanted pregnancies and low-birthweight babies.there were variations in the rates of violence against women in different regions of the world but, said garcia-moreno, “in whatever region we looked at, it is unacceptably high”. even in high-income countries, 23.2% of women will suffer physical and/or sexual violence from a partner in their lives, their data from 81 countries shows. the global figure for women attacked by partners was 30%.more sexual assaults and rapes by acquaintances or strangers are reported in high-income countries than elsewhere – the report says that 12.6% of women in wealthy countries will be sexually attacked by a non-partner in their lives, which is higher than the african rate of 11.9%. but, the data on such crimes is not well collected in all regions.the authors say that their previous research shows that better-educated women are less likely to suffer violence, as are those who have jobs, although not in all regions. there is a need to tackle social norms, said watts. “what is society’s attitude concerning the acceptability of certain forms of violence against women?” she asked. “in some societies, it is not ok – but not all.”“i think the numbers are a wake-up call for all of us to pay more attention to this issue,” said garcia-moreno. over the past decade, there has been increasing recognition of the problem, she said, but “one has to recognize that it is a complex problem. we don’t have a vaccine or a pill”.the new who clinical and policy guidelines recommend training for healthcare staff in recognizing the signs of domestic violence and sexual assault, but they rule out general screening – there is not a case for asking every woman who arrives in a clinic whether she has been subjected to violence.“but, if you see a woman coming back several times with undisclosed injuries, you should be asking about domestic violence,” said garcia-moreno. “when i was training in medical school, it wasn’t something you learned or knew about. years later, i was sometimes in a situation where i could tell there was something else going on in the woman i was interviewing, but didn’t have any sense that domestic violence was the issue. now, i think i would handle the interview very differently.”
advanced	in homes and cafes across the country, a cup of tea, baked beans on toast and fish and chips have long played a key role in the british dining experience. but, the extent of a change in tastes over the generations has been captured in a dataset published recently in the national food survey, which was set up in 1940 by the government after concerns about health and access to food.despite the apparent british love of tea, consumption has more than halved since the 1970s, falling from 68g of tea per person per week to only 25g. with a teabag or portion of loose tea weighing around 3g, that means britons are drinking on average only eight cups of tea a week today, down from 23 cups in 1974. and, while tea remains the most drunk hot drink in the uk, households now spend more on coffee.the data, published by the department for environment, food and rural affairs as part of its “open data” scheme, is from 150,000 households who took part in the survey between 1974 and 2000, combined with information from 2000 to 2014. it shows some moves towards healthier diets in recent decades, with shifts to low-calorie soft drinks, from whole to skimmed milk and increasing consumption of fresh fruit. but, weekly consumption of chips, pizza, crisps and ready meals has soared.there has also been a dramatic shift from white to brown, wholemeal and other bread but the figures suggest the amount people are eating has fallen from 25 to 15 slices a week over the past four decades, based on a 40g slice from a medium sliced loaf. the consumption of baked beans in sauce has dropped by a fifth despite a rise in other types of convenience food, particularly italian dishes. adults in the uk now eat an average of 75g of pizza every week compared with none in 1974, while the consumption of pasta has almost tripled over the same period.fresh potatoes are also becoming less essential with a 67% decrease from 1974, when adults ate the equivalent of 188g every day. other vegetables such as cucumbers, courgettes, aubergines and mushrooms have gained space on the table. consumption of takeaway food has almost doubled since 1974, from 80g per person per week to 150g. around 33g of this amount is chips and 56g is meat, with kebabs (10g), chicken (7g), burgers (5g) and “meat-based meals” (32g) particularly popular.some trends suggest that british people are becoming more prudent in what they put on their plates, with the average consumption of fruit, both fresh and processed, increasing by 50% since 1974. in 2014, uk adults ate an average of 157g of fruit per day, equivalent to almost two portions of the five-a-day recommendation from the government. bananas have been the most popular fruit in the uk since 1996, reaching 221g per adult per week in 2014, well above apples (131g) and oranges (48g). low-calorie soft drinks represented half of all soft drinks consumed in 2014 for the first time.other social changes emerge from the survey, with questions about owning chickens and getting your own eggs being dropped in 1991 and a somewhat belated end in the same year to asking the “housewife” to fill out the questionnaire. britons are spending a smaller proportion of pay on food today – 11%, compared with 24% in 1974.the uk environment secretary, elizabeth truss, said: “food is the heart and soul of our society and this data not only shows what we were eating 40 years ago but how a change in culture has led to a food revolution. shoppers are more plugged in to where their food comes from than ever before, the internet has brought quality produce to our doorsteps at the click of a button, pop-up restaurants are showcasing the latest trends and exciting global cuisines are now as common as fish and chips.”“by opening up this data, we can look beyond what, where or how previous generations were eating and pinpoint the moments that changed our habits for good. we’ve only scraped the surface of what the national food survey can tell us and, from local food maps and school projects to predicting new food trends, i look forward to seeing how this data can be used to learn more about our past and grow our world-leading food and farming industry in the future.”
advanced	lego’s profits rose strongly in the first half of 2014, helped by the success of its lego movie, which has stormed box offices in the us and uk.the danish toy firm’s sales rose across europe, the americas and asia as children snapped up products linked to the film. the film, released in february, took more than $250m in the us and £31m in the uk by the first weekend in april.the movie cost about $60m to make and has been described as a near-flawless piece of content marketing by creating entertaining content aimed at consumers who are likely to go out and buy the company’s products.lego’s finance director, john goodwin, said: “the strong performance of the lego movie products had a positive effect during the first half of 2014, and it remains to be seen how the line will continue to develop behind the highly anticipated launch of the movie on dvd in the second half of 2014.”operating profit for the first six months of lego’s financial year increased by 12% to $630m. sales rose by 11% to more than three times the figure six years before.jørgen vig knudstorp, lego’s chief executive, said: “it is a very satisfactory result that shows our significant growth in recent years in a tough economic environment. the result for the first half of 2014 is an outcome of our ability to develop, launch and distribute lego products, which children all over the world put at the top of their wishlists.”lego, based in the small town of billund, started producing its plastic bricks in 1949 and became a staple children’s toy around the world by the 1970s. but the group lost its way and was on the brink of collapse in 2003. knudstrop took over as chief executive, ending 70 years of family rule, and ditched hundreds of surplus products to refocus the business on its trademark bricks.the company opened its first factory in china in april and opened an office in shanghai to spearhead expansion in the world’s secondbiggest economy.
advanced	the vast fortunes made by the world’s richest 100 billionaires are driving up inequality and hindering the world’s ability to tackle poverty, according to oxfam.the charity said the accumulation of wealth and income on an unprecedented scale, often at the expense of secure jobs and decent wages for the poorest, undermined the ability of people who survive on aid or low wages to improve their situation and escape poverty.oxfam said the world’s poorest could be lifted out of poverty several times over if the richest 100 billionaires would give away the money they made in 2012.without pointing a finger at individuals, the charity argued that the $240bn net income amassed in 2012 by the richest 100 billionaires would be enough to make extreme poverty history four times over.it is rare for charities to attack the wealthy, who are usually regarded as a source of funding. bill gates and warren buffett are among a group of 40 us billionaires who have pledged much of their wealth to aid projects, but there is little detail about the level of their annual donations. their actions have also not been matched by russian, middle eastern or chinese billionaires.in the report, the cost of inequality: how wealth and income extremes hurt us all, published just before the world economic forum in davos, the charity calls on world leaders to curb income extremes and commit to reducing inequality to at least 1990 levels.the report found that the richest 1% had increased their incomes by 60% in the past 20 years, with the financial crisis accelerating rather than slowing the process.barbara stocking, oxfam’s chief executive, said extreme wealth was “economically inefficient, politically corrosive, socially divisive and environmentally destructive”.she said studies show that countries suffer low levels of investment and growth as workers are forced to survive on a smaller share of total incomes.she said: “we can no longer pretend that the creation of wealth for a few will inevitably benefit the many – too often the reverse is true.”the report said the issue affected all parts of the world. “in the uk, inequality is rapidly returning to levels not seen since the time of charles dickens [the nineteenth-century novelist]. in china, the top 10% now take home nearly 60% of the income. chinese inequality levels are now similar to those in south africa, which is now the most unequal country on earth and significantly more unequal than at the end of apartheid.”in the us, the share of national income going to the top 1% has doubled since 1980 from 10 to 20%, the report says. for the top 0.01% the share of national income is above levels last seen in the 1920s.the world bank and international monetary fund have argued that extreme income inequality undermines growth and both organizations have attempted to tie their loans to programmes that limit the growth of inequality.members of the richest 1% are estimated to use as much as 10,000 times more carbon than the average us citizen.oxfam said world leaders should learn from countries such as brazil, which has grown rapidly while reducing inequality.stocking said: “we need a global new deal to reverse decades of increasing inequality. as a first step, world leaders should formally commit themselves to reducing inequality to the levels seen in 1990.”she said closing tax havens, which the tax justice network says hold as much as $31 trillion, or as much as a third of all global wealth, could yield $189bn in additional tax revenues.
advanced	scientists have created an òatlas of the brainó that reveals how the meanings of words are arranged across different regions of the organ. like a colourful quilt laid over the cortex, the atlas displays in rainbow hues how individual words and the concepts they convey can be grouped together in clumps of white matter.òour goal was to build a giant atlas that shows how one speci c aspect of language is represented in the brain, in this case semantics or the meanings of words,ó said jack gallant, a neuroscientist at the university of california, berkeley.no single brain region holds one word or concept. a single brain spot is associated with a number of related words. and, each single word lights up many different brain spots. together, they make up networks that represent the meanings of each word we use: life and love, death and taxes, clouds, florida and bra. all light up their own networks.described as a òtour de forceó by one researcher who was not involved in the study, the atlas demonstrates how modern imaging can transform our knowledge of how the brain performs some of its most important tasks. with further advances, the technology could have a profound impact on medicine and other  elds.òit is possible that this approach could be used to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking,ó said alexander huth, the  rst author on the study. one potential use would be a language decoder that could allow people silenced by motor neurone disease or locked-in syndrome to speak through a computer.to create the atlas, the scientists recorded peopleõs brain activity while they listened to stories read out on the moth radio hour, a us radio show. they then matched the transcripts of the stories with the brain activity data to show how groups of related words triggered neural responses in 50,000 to 80,000 pea-sized spots all over the cerebral cortex.huth used stories from the moth radio hour because they are short and compelling. the more enthralling the stories, the more con dent the scientists could be that the people being scanned were focusing on the words and not drifting off. seven people listened to two hours of stories each. per person, that amounted to hearing roughly 25,000 words ð and more than 3,000 different words ð as they lay in the scanner.the atlas shows how words and related terms exercise the same regions of the brain. for example, on the left-hand side of the brain, above the ear, is one of the tiny regions that represents the word òvictimó. the same region responds to òkilledó, òconvictedó, òmurderedó and òconfessedó. on the brainõs right-hand side, near the top of the head, is one of the brain spots activated by family terms: òwifeó, òhusbandó, òchildrenó, òparentsó.each word is represented by more than one spot because words tend to have several meanings. one part of the brain, for example, reliably responds to the word òtopó, along with other words that describe clothing. but, the word òtopó activates many other regions. one of them responds to numbers and measurements, another to buildings and places. the scientists have created an interactive website where the public can explore the brain atlas.strikingly, the brain atlases were similar for all the participants, suggesting that their brains organized the meanings of words in the same way. the scientists only scanned  ve men and two women, however. all are native english speakers and two are authors of the study published in nature. it is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different semantic brain atlases.armed with the atlas, researchers can now piece together the brain networks that represent wildly different concepts, from numbers to murder and religion. òthe idea of murder is represented a lot in the brain,ó gallant said.using the same data, the group has begun work on new atlases that show how the brain holds information on other aspects of language, from phonemes to syntax. a brain atlas for narrative structure has so far proved elusive, however. òevery time we come up with a set of narrative features, we get told they arenõt the right set of narrative features,ó said gallant. uri hasson, a neuroscientist at princeton university, praised the work. unlike many studies that looked at brain activity when an isolated word or sentence was spoken, gallantõs team had shed light on how the brain worked in a real- world scenario, he said. the next step, he added, was to create a more comprehensive and precise semantic brain atlas. ultimately, hasson believes it will be possible to reconstruct the words a person is thinking from their brain activity. the ethical implications are enormous. one more benign use would see brain activity used to assess whether political messages have been effectively communicated to the public. òthere are so many implications and we are barely touching the surface,ó he said. lorraine tyler, a cognitive neuroscientist and head of the centre for speech, language and the brain at cambridge university, said the research was a òtour de force in its scope and methodsó. but, the brain atlas in its current form does not capture  ne differences in word meanings. òwhile this research is path-breaking in its scope, there is still a lot to learn about how semantics is represented in the brain.ó
advanced	it began with a bogus scallop, but a menu scandal that has engulfed some of japan’s most prestigious hotels and department stores now threatens to undermine the international reputation of the country’s vaunted cuisine.since one luxury hotel chain admitted lying about the provenance of ingredients on its menus, japanese media have served up almost daily revelations of similar transgressions by restaurants run by well-known hotels and department stores.the frenzy began when the hankyu-hanshin hotel chain, based in osaka, admitted it had given false descriptions of dozens of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and october 2013, affecting an estimated 78,000 diners.among the chief menu misdemeanours was a red salmon ‘caviar’ dish that turned out to be the less sumptuous eggs of the flying fish.a televised attempt by the hotel group’s president, hiroshi desaki, to limit the damage by announcing a 20% pay cut for himself and 10% for other executives, failed to mollify angry consumers.days later, desaki resigned, conceding that the hotel group had “betrayed our customers”, although he added: “we never had the intention to deceive them.” one of the hotel’s head chefs later declined a medal of honour he was due to receive from the government.the company has so far refunded more than 10,000 consumers to the tune of 20m yen; the eventual bill is expected to reach 110m yen.japan’s version of the uk horsemeat scandal has since spread to several household names in catering. while, as in the uk, no one has fallen ill from eating mislabelled produce, the outbreak of anger shows no sign of abating.consumers who believed they had eaten prized kuruma shrimps, for example, were told they had in fact dined on the much cheaper black tiger version.the first incident went almost unnoticed. the prince hotel in tokyo was forced to come clean after a diner complained in a blogpost that a ‘scallop’ dish he had ordered contained a similar, but cheaper, type of shellfish.the hotel launched an investigation and went on to correct more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants. its report scared hankyu-hanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they, too, had hoodwinked diners who believed they were paying high prices for premium ingredients.the hotel okura chain – whose guests have included barack obama – confessed myriad sins, including injecting beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly describing tomatoes as organic.“we deeply apologize for betraying the expectations and confidence of our clients,” it said in a statement.the list of fraudulent ingredients continues to grow: orange juice from cartons sold as freshly squeezed; mont blanc desserts topped with korean chestnuts instead of the promised french ones; bought-in chocolate cream masquerading as home-made; imported beef sold as high-end wagyu.even the government’s top spokesman, yoshihide suga, was moved to comment on the scandal. “these incidents have surfaced one after the other and this inappropriate labelling has resulted in the loss of trust among consumers,” he told reporters. “these are clearly cover-ups.”the fraudulent menu scandal has exploded at just the wrong time. japan is trying to persuade south korea and other countries to lift bans on food imports imposed in response to the fukushima nuclear accident, while unesco is considering a request to add japanese cuisine to its intangible cultural heritage list.one local newspaper ran the headline, “japan’s proud food culture in tears,” while the mass circulation yomiuri shimbun said it was “astonished by the industry’s lack of morals.”the newspaper voiced concerns that the scandal could “harm the credibility of brand japan, products and services, which are praised by foreign countries and tourists for their safety and security.”industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 had forced luxury hotels to cut costs while attempting to woo diners with detailed menu descriptions“menu descriptions were created to meet consumers’ preference for brand products, and, when they couldn’t obtain the ingredients stated on the menu, hotels just used food from different places of origin,” hiroshi tomozawa, a hotel and restaurant consultant, told kyodo news.while they count the cost to their reputations, the hotels and restaurants involved are unlikely to face legal action. menus are not covered by the agricultural standards law or by a new food labelling law due to go into effect in 2015. the authorities’ only legal weapon is a law banning misleading representations of goods and services.the industry’s biggest nemesis will be japan’s discerning and demanding consumers. in a 2009 poll conducted by an online restaurant guide, 72% of respondents said provenance was the most important factor in selecting dishes from a menu, followed by calorific and nutritional details.
