intermediate	back in 2005, when blackberry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone, the company was just entering its boom times. while the iphone was still just an idea, blackberry’s innovations ensured its smartphone was one of canada’s biggest exports.six years later, in the summer of 2011, when there were riots in london and other uk cities, blackberry messenger (bbm) was so effective at mobilizing the rioters that politicians wanted the service to be temporarily shut down. but, two years later, it is the users themselves who are pulling the plug.demand for blackberry phones is falling. dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place, from facebook’s and apple’s instant messaging applications to independent apps such as whatsapp and kik (which is also canadian). they are free to download and use, and they use the internet to swap text messages, pictures, voice clips, ‘stickers’ and even videos between most types of phones.in an attempt to keep its customers, bbm has been released on android and apple phones. despite the competition from other apps, the response has been extraordinary, with more than 20 million downloads. but, despite this interest, many people believe bbm’s wider release will not save the service. “the move to bring blackberry to the iphone is four or five years too late,” says james gooderson, an 18-year-old student who blogs on technology. “whatsapp has made blackberrys unnecessary for young people.”bbm says it has 80 million monthly users after its upgrade, but whatsapp has 300 million. other services show bbm’s limitations: unlike skype and viber, it does not yet offer video or voice calls; unlike path, it does not do location sharing; there is no video sharing, as on imessage; and the stickers (a more sophisticated version of the smiley face), adored by kids all over the world, are also absent. even the contacts and calendar sharing that bbm made possible on blackberry phones are not on the apple and android versions.messaging is moving from verbal to visual. photos uploaded to instagram get instant comments and snapchat’s pictures, which selfdelete after ten seconds, have opened a world of other possibilities. like bbm, all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection. but as recently as 2011, bbm was so powerful it helped to start a revolution in egypt; and at the time of the london riots, it was a more immediate source of news than the television screen.“we could see on our blackberry messages where the rioters were going next; tv news would catch up four hours later,” said jean- pierre moore, 28. he manages a youth club in stockwell, south london, an area with some of the highest levels of crime and poverty in britain. moore mainly communicates on an ipad now. he does not agree with the idea that a shutdown of bbm would have stopped the looting. “the social networking wasn’t the reason,” he says.nearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application but two-thirds use more than one. among 16- to 24-year-olds, 60% use facebook every day, but 46% use alternatives. “it’s a much more complex, multifaceted environment,” says benedict evans, a digital media specialist. “all of these apps use your smartphone – they plug into your phone book and your photo library. apps rise and fall like fireworks. some, like instagram, last; others just disappear.”thirteen-year-old bennett has three phones. he keeps his blackberry for messaging, uses an iphone to play games, and makes phone calls on an android phone. his friends are still on bbm. at the touch of a few buttons, a single blackberry message can be sent to the phone owner’s entire contacts book – several hundred people, in some cases; on whatsapp, the limit for a broadcast message is 50. but, for bennett, instagram is now a major social network. “instagram is facebook without parents,” he says. “facebook has been taken over by the older generation. when i saw my mum on facebook, i deleted my account.”the low cost of buying and communicating on a blackberry is still an advantage. unlimited bbm messages are available to anyone with a secondhand was a belief that encrypted words sent over the company’s secure servers could not be traced back to their writers. arrests and prosecutions after the riots put an end to that belief. phone and a £7-a-month deal from a telecoms company. but people no longer trust the privacy of bbm. part of the attraction to business people, revolutionaries, demonstrators and riotersacross town from stockwell, outside the gates of a private school in the rich district of south kensington, the older pupils all have apple logos on their phones. they all use whatsapp. for many, bbm is a distant memory. “i still have a blackberry, but i’m the only one,” says a teenager standing with a circle of friends. and how does that make him feel? “isolated,” he replies.
intermediate	james bond films are one of the world’s longest running and most successful film series, with 23 movies and more than $6bn earned at box offices around the world. but james bond shows no signs of slowing down. in fact, bond is more popular than ever, after the record-breaking performance of skyfall, which became the biggest ever film at the uk box office in 2012, earning a total of $1.1bn.for this reason, there was a lot of interest surrounding the announcement of a few more details about the 24th bond film – especially its official title, spectre. the number one question is: can spectre repeat skyfall’s success?charles gant, film editor for heat magazine, says it is heading in the right direction. “skyfall was a brilliant strategic move,” he says. “it was simultaneously modern and retro. it appealed to fans of daniel craig and it also engaged the older, more nostalgic bond fans, who may have lost interest over the previous few films. with the new title,” he adds, “it is certain to be a success.”it seems that eon productions, the company originally founded in 1961 to make dr no and that is behind all the “official” bonds, is doing all it can to ensure another success – they are installing the key creative talent behind skyfall on spectre. daniel craig will play bond at least until film 25 and the same writers have produced the script.but it’s getting sam mendes as director again that gives bond fans the most hope. a director mainly known for character studies such as american beauty and revolutionary road, mendes has taken the bond series to new heights. gant says: “mendes managed to engage with both the modern and the traditional bond audience, and he also attracted top actors like ralph fiennes. actors like fiennes will only agree to be in a film if they like the director.”though the bond series was not in trouble before mendes’s arrival – and craig’s – there was a certain amount of staleness towards the end of pierce brosnan’s time as bond. the series had survived the drying up of original bond stories to adapt, and the movies were no longer anything like the ian fleming originals, but they were lacking dynamism.this cycle, however, was nothing new: the history of the bond series has been one of ebb and flow, revolving most obviously around the lead actor: first, sean connery; then, successively, george lazenby, roger moore, timothy dalton, brosnan and, now, craig. each new bond has been a response to the state of the series, and some have been more successful than others.lazenby only lasted a single film and dalton’s two efforts, the living daylights and licence to kill, were during a period in the late 80s when the 007 movie was eclipsed by more aggressive, slick hollywood action movies. according to gant, “the period of roger moore’s last films, and the dalton period, didn’t really excite audiences. brosnan was more successful commercially, but craig has taken bond to new levels. on the other hand, the early bonds were incredibly commercial films, sexy and exciting, and there was very little like them.”skyfall made more money than all the other bond films. however, the performance of some of the 1960s films was almost as brilliant by comparison. if you adjust the figures for inflation, the 1965 release, thunderball, is only just below skyfall, while goldfinger and you only live twice both did better than the other craig films (and the 70s bonds, the spy who loved me and live and let die, did better, too). by this calculation, licence to kill is the worst-performing of all bonds, with moore’s final film, a view to a kill, the second least successful.nevertheless, the bond brand has remained very powerful over the years and eon has had to fight off attempts by rival companies to capitalize on the popularity of the series. through a quirk of rights ownership, adaptations of casino royale (in 1967) and thunderball (as never say never again, in 1983) were released in competition with eon productions. after legal disputes that continued for many years, eon now has full control of both books.martin campbell was another experienced british director and he was able to plan one of the most elaborate stunts in bond history. in the famous opening scene of goldeneye (released in 1995), bond freefalls into a pilotless light aeroplane. this scene really helped modernize the series and increase its popularity. moreover, a whole new generation was reached through a hugely successful goldeneye video-game spin-off, which made a significant contribution to perceptions that the bond film was no longer stale and old-fashioned.nannannan
intermediate	the problem with google glasses, says takahito iguchi, is that they’re not cool. he may be right. there’s already a website dedicated to people wearing them looking either ridiculous or smug or, more often, both. search google images and one of the first hits is a picture of a large, naked man wearing them in the shower. and it’s this that iguchi, a japanese entrepreneur, hopes may be google’s achilles’ heel. he is launching a competitor that is a bit more stylish. a bit more blade runner. a bit more japanese.iguchi’s augmented reality glasses aren’t really glasses – they are more a single piece of metal with a camera and a tiny projector. they are called telepathy one and, since they were presented to the public for the first time in austin, texas, they have attracted $5m of venture capital. like glass, telepathy one is due to launch in 2014.it’s a simplified version of google glass. glass has a range of uses – you can surf the internet, read emails, take photographs – but telepathy will be “more of a communication device”. connected via bluetooth to your phone, it will focus on real-time visual and audio sharing. you’ll be able to post photos and videos from your line of vision on facebook or send them as an email, or see and speak to a video image of a friend.“it will help bring you close to your friends and family. we are very focused on the communication and sharing possibilities,” says iguchi, who has worked in the japanese technology industry for 20 years.of course, not everyone wants to get closer to the man in the futuristic headset, i tell him. iguchi shakes his head. “i’m a visionary. i have a dream that people will understand other people. when i go to london, i am a stranger. sometimes i feel fear. but i believe that everyone wants to be understood and to understand each other. and, with this device, you can know more information about people before you even speak to them.”compared to google, telepathy is a minnow, but iguchi doesn’t seem to worry. in his shared office space in san francisco – a cool, converted warehouse – he quotes sun tzu’s the art of war and says that even tiny armies can sometimes beat powerful forces. when he was growing up, japanese technology ruled the world: the sony walkman was the iphone of its day. now, to compete, he’s had to leave tokyo and go to silicon valley.“tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture but it’s still an island. it’s isolated. there is not any way to expand. whereas, in silicon valley, everyone is from everywhere. it’s where you come to connect globally.” the hardware will be made in japan, and he is putting together a team of software engineers in the us to develop its applications.building the prototype of telepathy one was easy, iguchi says. “we have every sort of technology in tokyo. it is presenting it to the world that is the challenge.” the top manufacturers all want to work with him, he says, because they have the technology, they just struggle to sell it. “there needs to be a story to the product. like apple did with the ipod – 1,000 songs in your pocket. and steve jobs was inspired by akio morita, the co-founder of sony, and he inspired me, so maybe it will come in a circle.”maybe. he certainly has the confidence of jobs, but, with a thick japanese accent, he sometimes struggles to make himself understood, a fact that may have contributed to his idea for telepathy one. when he went to london to present the headset, he stayed in an airbnb. “the house owner was not my friend but i talked with him for three hours, and now he is my friend. that is how long it takes to understand each other, to share our feelings, and background, and career. maybe telepathy makes that quicker. if you are getting info from the cloud and social networks, that will happen more easily.”iguchi hopes that seeing somebody else’s i suddenly realized that everything is code. everything is coded and is shareable between humans. and everything can be encoded and decoded. and, if code is exchangeable between humans, that will end all war.” literal point of view will help you to see their metaphorical point of view. as a student, he explains, he studied philosophy by day and taught himself how to code by night. “and, one day, i opened the door of my apartment and
intermediate	chemists have waited a long time for a new element to turn up and, now, four have been discovered by researchers in japan, russia and the us. the four new elements are the first to be added to the periodic table since 2011, when elements 114 and 116 were included. the new elements, all highly radioactive, complete seventh row of the periodic table and mean that science textbooks around the world are now out of date.the us-based international union of pure and applied chemistry (iupac), the global organization that controls chemical names, terminology and measurement, verified the elements on 30 december, 2015 after examining studies dating back to 2004. the scientists who found them must now come up with formal names to replace the latin-based temporary names – ununtrium, ununpentium, ununseptium and ununoctium – which reflect their atomic numbers, 113, 115, 117, and 118. the atomic number is the number of protons found in an element’s atomic nucleus.iupac announced that a russian-american team of scientists at the joint institute for nuclear research in dubna and lawrence livermore national laboratory in california had produced enough evidence to claim the discovery of elements 115, 117 and 118. the organization gave credit for the discovery of element 113, which had also been claimed by the russians and americans, to a team of scientists from the riken institute in japan. the decision means japan becomes the first asian country to name an element. under iupac rules, new elements can be named after mythological concepts, minerals, a place or country, or a scientist.when elements 114 and 116 were given formal names in 2012, scientists chose flerovium and livermorium respectively, after the flerov lab at dubna’s joint institute of research and the lawrence livermore lab in the us, where the elements were discovered. kosuke morita, who led the research at riken, said his team now planned to “look to the uncharted territory of element 119 and beyond”. jan reedijk of iupac, said: “the chemistry community is eager to see the table finally completed down to the seventh row.”the japanese team is considering three names for ununtrium: japonium, rikenium and nishinarium, after the nishina center for accelerator-based science, where the element was found. “they have been thinking about it for a while already,” said polly arnold, professor of chemistry at edinburgh university. “this is painstaking work. the work helps us with our models and with understanding radioactive decay. if we understand it better, hopefully we can improve how we deal with nuclear waste and things that are important in the real world. it also leads to fantastic technological advances in building the kit to make these observations.”along with new names, the scientists must suggest two-letter symbols for the elements. when iupac has received the researchers’ suggestions, they will go to public review for five months. that allows scientists and others to raise any objections. in 1996, the symbol cp was suggested for copernicium, or element 112, but it was changed to cn when scientists complained that cp referred to another substance.to discover the elements, researchers at the three labs slammed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for radioactive decays that should come from the new elements. ununtrium and ununpentium are thought to be metals. ununseptium could be a metalloid. the fourth element, ununoctium, may be a gas, like other elements, helium, neon and argon. it is hard to know for sure because so few atoms of each element have ever been made.paul karol, chair of the iupac panel that verified the elements, said: “it will be a long time before we can find practical uses for the new elements.”
intermediate	he had the tastes of a typical millionaire. he owned a gold and silver rolex and lots of expensive cars. he liked to buy modern art. but, although this chinese businessman had several companies and a large villa in madrid, he had almost no money in the bank. this detail interested the spanish authorities.gao ping supplied 4,000 chinese bazaars across spain. but, authorities suspected he was not paying taxes on the clothes, furniture and other goods he was importing from china.when police searched his warehouses in 2012 they found piles of cash: €100, €200 and €500 notes were wrapped in elastic bands. around €12m was taken away, the largest amount of cash ever found by spanish police. gao’s gang is accused of laundering up to €300m a year, as well as selling counterfeit goods and toys with fake safety marks.law enforcement officials have been worried about €500 notes for a long time. small and easy to transport relative to their value, they are the payment method that tax dodgers, money launderers and drug barons prefer to use. the sum of €1m in €500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag. the same amount in €50 notes would need a small suitcase.the uk stopped distribution of the €500 note in 2010 because it was used “almost entirely by criminals”. in 2009, italy’s central bank warned that the notes were widely used by mafia money launderers and terrorists. other countries have limited their own high-denomination notes due to links to organized crime – canada got rid of its $1,000 note in 2000 on the advice of law enforcement officers.now, with electronic payment systems and contactless cards, people are asking whether we should print these notes. peter sands, the former head of standard chartered bank, said we should get rid of high-denomination notes, including the €500, the $100, the 1,000 swiss franc note and the £50. in a report for the harvard kennedy school of government, sands said it was time to get rid of high-value notes that make life easier for “bad guys”. criminals would instead use smaller-denomination bills, or gold or diamonds, but these are too big to be carried easily and more traceable. this makes it more likely they will get caught, he said.at a conference on terrorist financing in london, the head of europol, rob wainwright, asked the european central bank to look at whether it “should continue to produce these notes that make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide their business and to provide money for illegal activities”. according to europol, the purple €500 note makes up 30% of the value of all the euro notes, although most people have never seen one.the €500 note was introduced in 2002 when the euro was born: it replaced the 1,000 deutschmark, the 10,000 belgian franc and the 500,000 italian lira. in germany and austria, more than half of all transactions are still made with paper money and coins.europol would like to see central banks take more responsibility for what happens with €500 notes. luxembourg, for example, issued more than twice its annual gdp in banknotes in 2013 alone. europol asked luxembourg’s central bank to explain. the reply from luxembourg was that they simply issue the notes that are asked for and do not ask or know why people want them, said jennifer macleod, a specialist in europol’s financial intelligence group. “i find it surprising that a central bank does not consider itself to have a responsibility in this area.”this could be changing. eu finance ministers have asked policymakers to think about “appropriate limits” on high-value notes and report back by 1 may 2016.nannan
intermediate	the world shares him and london claims him but stratford-upon-avon intends to spend 2016 celebrating william shakespeare as their man: the bard of avon, born in the warwickshire market town in 1564, who died there 400 years ago.stratford remained hugely important during shakespeareõs life, says paul edmondson, the head of learning and research at the shakespeare birthplace trust. òpeople often see shakespeare as someone who turned his back on stratford and his family, went to london to earn his fortune and only came back to die,ó he said. òbut stratford is where he bought land and property, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought. we are going to spend the year re-emphasizing the importance of shakespeare, the man of stratford.óthe anniversary of the death of the man from stratford, the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world, will be celebrated across britain and the globe. macbeth will open in singapore, romeo and juliet in brussels. shakespeareõs globe is completing the  rst world tour in the history of theatre. it has taken hamlet to every country except north korea. in london, they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema, one screen to showcase each of shakespeareõs plays.the national theatre, the royal shakespeare company and nearly every other theatre production company in the country will celebrate the anniversary. interpretations of the plays will range from the highly traditional to the experimental. there will also be hundreds of lectures, recitals, international academic conferences,  lms, concerts, operas and major exhibitions.for a man famous in his own lifetime, there is little documentary evidence for shakespeareõs life and times. the plays would probably not have survived if his friends and fellow actors had not gathered together every bit of every play they could  nd ð drafts, prompt scripts, scribbled actorsõ parts and 17 plays not known in any other version ð into the precious first folio published in 1623, seven years after shakespeareõs death.the actor mark rylance has called it his favourite book in the world and most of the surviving first folios will be on display ð including those belonging to the british and bodleian libraries, and a tattered copy recently discovered in france. some of the most precious surviving documents will be collected together in an exhibition at somerset house in london, including four of his six known signatures, which are all slightly different.the exhibition, by me, william shakespeare, will include his will, the court papers relating to the audacious move when shakespeare and his fellow actors dismantled a theatre on the north side of the thames and rebuilt it as the globe on the south bank, and accounts showing payments from the royal treasury for boxing day performances for james i and queen anne.the director of the globe, dominic dromgoole, recently jokily claimed shakespeare was a true londoner. stratford, however, will be insisting that the town made and educated shakespeare. they are restoring his old school room. it will open as a permanent visitor attraction.shakespeare bought the splendid new place, the second best house in the town, where he died, according to literary legend, on st georgeõs day, 23 april, the same day as his birth. òyou donõt buy a house like new place and not live there,ó paul edmondson said. òthe general public and many academics have consistently underestimated the importance of stratford to shakespeare.óedmondson believes that, after shakespeare bought the house in 1597, all his thinking time was spent there and that the late plays, including the tempest, were at least planned in his library and probably written there. the shakespeare birthplace trust describes new place as òthe jewel in the crown of the 400th anniversary celebrationsó.however, shakespeareõs house was demolished 300 years ago and the house that replaced it was demolished in 1759 by a bad-tempered priest, francis gastrell, in an argument over taxes. he had already cut down shakespeareõs mulberry tree, under which the writer is said to have sat and worked, because he was irritated by all the tourists peering into his garden.the gap where the house was has never been  lled. but the news that shakespeareõs kitchen had been found in the partly surviving cellars went round the world. the whole site is being displayed for the anniversary, with the oundations marked and the garden restored. òwithout stratford,ó edmondson said, òthere would have been no shakespeare.ónan
intermediate	water scientists have given one of the strongest warnings ever about global food supplies. they say that the world’s population may have to change almost completely to a vegetarian diet by 2050 to avoid catastrophic shortages.humans get about 20% of their protein from animal-based products now. however, this may need to decrease to just 5% to feed the extra two billion people expected to be alive by 2050, according to research by some of the world’s top water scientists.“there will not be enough water to produce food for the expected nine-billion population in 2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards diets common in western nations,” the report by malik falkenmark and colleagues at the stockholm international water institute (siwi) said.“there will be just enough water if the proportion of animal-based foods is limited to 5% of total calories.”warnings that water scarcity could limit food production come at the same time as oxfam and the un prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years. prices for items such as corn and wheat have risen nearly 50% on international markets since june. the price increase has been caused by severe droughts in the us and russia, and weak monsoon rains in asia. more than 18 million people are already facing serious food shortages across the sahel.oxfam says that the price increase will have a devastating effect in developing countries that rely heavily on food imports, including parts of latin america, north africa and the middle east. food shortages in 2008 led to fighting and riots in 28 countries.changing to a vegetarian diet is one way to increase the amount of water available to grow more food in a world where the climate is becoming increasingly erratic, the scientists said. animal protein-rich food uses five to ten times more water than a vegetarian diet. one third of the world’s arable land is used to grow crops to feed animals. other options to feed people include stopping waste and increasing trade between countries that have a food surplus and countries that don’t have enough food.“nine hundred million people already go hungry and two billion people are malnourished although per-capita food production continues to increase,” they said. “seventy per cent of all water is used in agriculture, and growing more food to feed an extra two billion people by 2050 will place greater pressure on water and land.”the report is being released at the start of the annual world water conference in stockholm, sweden, where 2,500 politicians, un groups, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries meet to discuss global water supply problems.competition for water between food production and other uses will increase pressure on essential resources, the scientists said. “the un predicts that we must increase food production by 70% by mid-century. this will put additional pressure on our water resources, which are already stressed, at a time when we also need more water to satisfy global energy demand and to create electricity for the 1.3 billion people who are without it,” said the report.overeating, malnourishment and waste are all increasing. “we will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future,” said the report’s editor, anders jägerskog.nannannannan
intermediate	‘fit in four minutes’ sounds like a headline from a health magazine or an impossible promise on late-night satellite tv. then you try dr izumi tabata’s training programme – 20 seconds of allout effort, ten seconds of rest, repeat eight times – and, after collapsing on the floor, you realize you were wrong.tabata has seen it all before. “they were dead!” he laughs as he remembers the first time he tried out his system on his university students in the early 1990s. “after four minutes’ hard exercise they were completely exhausted. but after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised. we all were.”he began his research after he watched japan’s speed skating team in the early 1990s – he noticed that short bursts of incredibly hard exercise seemed to be at least as effective as hours of moderate training. tabata tried to prove this with a simple experiment. one group of moderately trained students did an hour of steady cardiovascular exercise on an exercise bike five times a week. the other group did a ten-minute warm-up on the bike, followed by four minutes of tabata training, four times a week – plus one 30-minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of tabata.the results were very surprising. after six weeks of testing, the group following tabata’s plan – exercising for just 88 minutes a week – had increased their anaerobic capacity by 28% and their vo2 max, something that shows your cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power, by 15%. the control group, who trained for five hours every week, also improved their vo2 max, but by 10% – and their training had no effect on anaerobic capacity.”we also measured increases in heart size after three weeks of doing the exercises,” says tabatabut you have to work very, very hard. you can’t sit on a cross trainer, chewing gum and reading the latest issue of hello! the programme demands intensive bursts on a stationary bike or rowing machine; explosive bodyweight exercises, sprints and so on. remember how you felt after doing a 100m sprint at school? imagine doing eight of them with only a tensecond break to recover.“all-out effort at 170% of your vo2 max is the basis of the programme,” says tabata. “if you feel ok afterwards, you’ve not done it properly. the first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossibly hard. in the original plan the aim was to get to eight, but some only managed six or seven.”one person on an online forum wrote: “when done correctly you should meet god. most people are incapable of doing it correctly and shouldn’t even try.” tabata doesn’t completely agree. “everyone can do it but beginners should start with educated trainers so that they can work at the correct intensity for them,” he explains. he adds that his programme burns an extra 150 calories in the 12 hours after exercise, even at rest. so, although it is used by most people to get fit – or by fit people to get even fitter – it also burns fat.it’s slightly surprising, therefore, that only serious athletes follow the programme at the moment. but that may change now that tabata has agreed a deal that will lead to a network of instructors and a dvd range released towards the end of the year. “i decided to do this because i often go on youtube and, while i am pleased that people are doing it, some are doing it wrong because they don’t realize how hard they need to work,” says tabata.so should we all start following this plan? richard scrivener, a former rugby fitness coach, says that while the benefits are clear, tabatas are an addition, not a replacement, to a favoured sport or training method. “runners, for instance, need a high level of running economy, which comes from learning the skills and running for many miles,” says scrivener, “but they could reduce the number of long runs and the overall mileage by introducing tabata training. this will give joints the chance to rest and recover, especially if you have a history of injuries – and you would probably therefore get more benefit from the long runs when you do them.”gym rats can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three tabatas a week. and the rest of us can slowly increase the number of sessions, although we know that it will never get easier because every session needs maximum effort. that’s the cruel genius of the programme: it is hard – and effective.nannan
intermediate	according to american researchers, a nasal spray containing the ‘love hormone’ oxytocin could help children with autism behave more normally in social situations. scans of autistic children showed that a single dose of the chemical improved brain responses to facial expressions. this is something that could make social interactions feel more natural and rewarding for them.the researchers said oxytocin might increase the success of behavioural therapies that are already used to help people with autism learn to cope with social situations. “over time, what you would expect to see is more normal social responding, being more interested in interacting with other people, more eye contact and more conversation,” said kevin pelphrey, of yale university.autism is a developmental disorder that more than one in 100 people have. the condition affects people in different ways, but leads to difficulties in social interaction and communication. so far, there is no established treatment for the social problems caused by autism.researchers at yale have studied the brain chemical oxytocin as a possible treatment for the social problems caused by autism because it plays an important role in bonding and trust. results have been mixed, though: one recent study found no significant benefit for young people given the chemical over several days. but pelphrey said oxytocin might help the brain learn from social interactions; it would work best when used with therapies that encourage people with autism to interact more socially, he said.the scientists scanned the brains of 17 young people aged eight to 16 with autism while they looked at images of cars or the eyes of people expressing different emotions. the scans were given 45 minutes after the young people inhaled a placebo or oxytocin through a nasal spray.the scans showed that the reward circuits in the children’s brains behaved more normally after a dose of oxytocin: that is, they were more active when the person was looking at faces and less active when looking at the inanimate cars. the study appears in the latest issue of the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences in the united states.“the study suggests that oxytocin might treat something for which we don’t have a treatment in autism, and that’s the core social motivation,” said pelphrey. he warned that it was too early to use oxytocin as a treatment for the social difficulties caused by autism and said people should not buy oxytocin online. “we don’t want them trying oxytocin at home. it’s impossible to say what they are buying. we are nowhere near thinking this is a ready treatment. it needs more follow-up,” he said. “this is an important new study in identifying changes in brain activity in key areas of the brain,” said simon baron-cohen, director of the autism research centre at cambridge university.a surprising finding, however, is that oxytocin nasal spray did not change performance in social recognition tasks. and, it is also not yet clear if oxytocin only has benefits for people with autism or has any unwanted side effects. finally, oxytocin effects only last about 45 minutes, so there may be practical considerations as to whether this could be used as a treatment.“from a scientific perspective, this study has a lot of evidence from animal and human work to justify serious attention, but more research is needed. doctors should be cautious about the potential of this hormone until we know much more about its benefits and risks, in much larger studies.” said simon baron-cohen.uta frith, who studies autism at university college london, said: “according to this study, oxytocin may have the effect of making faces more interesting. disappointingly, this effect is seen only in brain activity and not in behaviour. demonstrating an effect on behaviour will be critical if nasal spray treatment is to be of any value.”nan
intermediate	until the end, david bowie, who has died of cancer, was still full of surprises. his latest album, blackstar, appeared on his 69th birthday on 8 january 2016 and proved that he hadn’t lost his gift for making dramatic statements as well as challenging, disturbing music.throughout the 1970s, bowie was a trailblazer of musical trends and pop fashion. he became a singer-songwriter, a pioneer of glam-rock, then got into what he called “plastic soul”, before moving to berlin to create innovative electronic music. his ability to mix brilliant changes of sound and image is unique in pop history.bowie was born david robert jones in south london. in 1953, the family moved to kent, where david showed talent for singing and playing the recorder. later, he studied art, music and design.at 15, david formed his first band, the kon-rads. it was clear that david’s talents and ambition meant that he should go solo. david took the name bowie to avoid confusion with davy jones of the monkees.bowie’s first album, released in june 1967, was titled simply david bowie. in july 1969, bowie released space oddity, the song that would give him his first commercial breakthrough. timed to coincide with the apollo 11 moon landing, it was a top five uk hit.in march 1970, bowie married art student, angela barnett. the man who sold the world was released in the us in late 1970 and in the uk the following year. with its daring songwriting and broody, hard-rock sound, it was the first album to really show his writing and performing gifts. the album’s themes included immortality, insanity, murder and mysticism, which showed that bowie was a songwriter who was thinking outside of pop’s usual boundaries.he followed it with 1972’s hunky dory, a mix of wordy, elaborate songwriting. it was an excellent collection that met with only moderate success but that all changed with the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars later that year.this time, bowie appeared as a science-fiction character – an intergalactic glam-rock star visiting planet earth. the hit single starman brought instant success for the album.everything bowie touched turned to gold. he had his first uk number 1 album with aladdin sane (1973), which included the hit singles the jean genie and drive-in saturday. but bowie was already planning his next career moves.his increasing interest in funk and soul music could be heard on the album young americans (1975), which gave him a us chart-topper with fame (with john lennon as a guest vocalist).with the album station to station (1976), bowie introduced a new persona, the thin white duke. this persona was the same as his role as a sad space traveller in nicolas roeg’s film the man who fell to earth.bowie’s relationship with his wife had been suffering under the pressures of success and the couple divorced in 1980. this was a year of further creative triumph, bringing a fine album, scary monsters (and super creeps), and its chart-topping single, ashes to ashes, followed by a period playing the title role in the elephant man on the broadway stage.he achieved a number 1 single with his 1981 partnership with queen, under pressure, and became increasingly involved with different media. he appeared in the german movie christiane f (1981) and wrote music for the soundtrack. he had another chart hit with cat people (putting out fire) from paul schrader’s movie cat people (1982).1983 was the year in which he put his energy into the album let’s dance and follow-up concerts. let’s dance turned bowie into a crowd-friendly global rock star, with the album and its singles let’s dance, china girl and modern love all becoming huge international hits.this was the heyday of mtv and bowie’s talent for eye-catching videos increased his popularity, while the six-month serious moonlight tour drew massive crowds. it was to be the most commercially successful period of his career.at the 1985 live aid famine relief concert at wembley stadium, bowie was one of the best performers. in addition, that year, he teamed up with mick jagger to record the fundraising single dancing in the street, which quickly went to number 1.a few days after his appearance at the freddie mercury tribute concert at wembley stadium in april 1992, bowie married the somalian model iman and the couple bought a home in new york.for the album black tie white noise (1993), he included elements of soul, electronica and hip hop. it topped the uk album chart and gave him a top 10 single, jump they say.new media and technology influenced his recordings, too. his 1999 album hours… was based around music he had written for a computer game called omikron, in which bowie and iman appeared as characters. the birth of bowie and iman’s daughter, alexandria, followed in august 2000.as an adopted new yorker, bowie was the opening act at the concert for new york city in october 2001, where he joined paul mccartney, jon bon jovi, billy joel, the who and elton john in a benefit show six weeks after the 9/11 attacks.during his reality tour in 2004, bowie had chest pains while performing in germany and needed emergency surgery in hamburg.he saw the medical emergency as a warning and started to slow down. in february 2006, he was given a grammy lifetime achievement award. he was entered into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1996.the next day (2013) was his first album of new material in a decade. it included the single where are we now?, which gave him his first uk top 10 hit since 1993. the album went to the top of the charts in britain and around the world. in 2014, bowie was given the brit award for best british male, making him the oldest person to get the award.he is survived by iman, their daughter, alexandria, his stepdaughter, zulekha, and his son, duncan, from his first marriage.
elementary	water scientists have given a very strong warning about the world’s food supplies. they say that everyone may have to change to a vegetarian diet by 2050.we believe there will be an extra two billion people in the world by 2050. humans get about 20% of their protein from animal-based products now, but this may need to decrease to just 5% to feed these extra people, say the world’s top water scientists.“there will not be enough water to produce food for the nine-billion population in 2050 if more people start eating like people in the west,” the report by malik falkenmark and colleagues at the stockholm international water institute (siwi) said.“there will be enough water if the percentage of animal-based foods is limited to 5% of total calories.”there are warnings that water shortages will limit food production. at the same time, oxfam and the un prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years. prices for food items such as corn and wheat have increased nearly 50% on international markets since june. the price increase has been caused by very bad droughts in the us and russia, and weak monsoon rains in asia. more than 18 million people already have serious food shortages across the sahel.oxfam says that the effects of price increases will be very bad in developing countries that need to buy food from other countries, including parts of latin america, north africa and the middle east. food shortages in 2008 led to fighting in 28 countries.changing to a vegetarian diet is one way to keep more water to grow food, the scientists said. animal protein-rich food uses five to ten times more water than vegetarian food. one third of the world’s farmland is used to grow crops to feed animals.“nine hundred million people already don’t have enough food and two million people are malnourished, even though we are producing more food,” they said. “70% of all water is used in farming, and growing more food to feed an extra two billion people by 2050 will put more pressure on water and land.”the report was released at the start of the annual world water conference in stockholm, sweden, where 2,500 politicians, un groups, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries met to discuss global water supply problems.eating too much, malnourishment and waste are all increasing. “we will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future,” said the report’s editor, anders jägerskog.nannannannannan
elementary	james bond films are one of the world’s oldest and most successful film series. twenty-three bond films have been made so far. they have earned more than $6 billion at cinemas around the world. james bond is not slowing down. in fact, the films are more popular than ever – skyfall, which broke all records and became the biggest ever film at uk cinemas in 2012, earned a total of $1.1 billion.so, there was a lot of interest when they announced more details about the 24th bond film – especially its title, spectre. the number one question is: can spectre be as successful as skyfall?charles gant, film editor for heat magazine, thinks it can. “they were very clever when they made skyfall,” he says. “it was both modern and retro. daniel craig fans liked it and, also, older, more nostalgic bond fans, who lost interest over the previous few films. with the new title,” he adds, “it is certain to be a success.”eon productions is the company, started in 1961, that made dr no and all the “official” bond films. the company really wants the next film to be successful so it is using the same people that worked on skyfall in the new film. daniel craig will play bond and the same people have written the script. most importantly, sam mendes will again be the director. according to gant, mendes is the best bond director. gant says: “mendes attracted top actors like ralph fiennes. actors like fiennes will only be in a film if they like the director.”the bond series was not in trouble before the arrival of mendes – and craig – but the films were becoming a bit boring towards the end of pierce brosnan’s time as bond. there were no longer any more original bond stories to adapt and the films no longer had enough energy.this was nothing new: the history of the bond series has been one of constant change, especially of the lead actor: first, sean connery; then, george lazenby, roger moore, timothy dalton, brosnan and, now, craig. each new actor has been different and some have been better than others.lazenby only did one bond film. dalton’s two films, the living daylights and licence to kill, were during a period in the late 80s when more aggressive hollywood action movies were more popular. according to gant, “the period of roger moore’s last films and dalton’s films didn’t excite audiences. brosnan was more successful but craig is the best. on the other hand, the early bond films were sexy and exciting.”skyfall made more money than all the other bond films. but some of the 1960s bond films were almost as successful. with figures adjusted for inflation, the 1965 film thunderball is only a little bit below skyfall. and goldfinger and you only live twice both did better than the other craig films. licence to kill made the least money of all bond films and moore’s final film, a view to a kill, the second least.martin campbell is an experienced british director and he planned one of the most elaborate stunts in bond history. in the famous first scene of goldeneye (released in 1995), bond falls into a light aeroplane without a pilot. this scene helped to make the bond series more modern and popular. also, a very successful goldeneye video game created new, younger fans of bond and made people think that the bond film was no longer boring and old-fashioned.nannannannannan
elementary	the duke and duchess of cambridge have won the first part of their fight for privacy. a french magazine was told to stop selling or reusing photos of the royal couple. the pictures show the duchess sunbathing topless while on holiday in the south of france.it is possible that the magazine editor and the photographer or photographers will also have to go to a criminal court.the french magazine closer was told to give digital files of the pictures to the couple within 24 hours.closer’s publisher, mondadori magazines france, was also told to pay €2,000 in legal costs. the magazine will have to pay €10,000 for every day it does not give the couple the files.the court decided that every time mondadori – the publishing company owned by the ex italian prime minister silvio berlusconi – publishes a photograph in the future in france, they will get €10,000 fine.the couple welcome the judge’s decision. “they always believed the law was broken and that they had a right to their privacy.”the royal couple are pleased with the decision, but they want to have a much more public criminal trial against the magazine and photographer or photographers.under french law, if you do not respect someone’s privacy, you may have to spend a maximum of one year in prison and pay a fine of €45,000.this punishment would send a message to the world and, the couple hope, stop paparazzi taking photos like this in the future.on saturday the irish daily star also published the photos. and the italian celebrity magazine chi published a special edition of 26 pages with the photos of the future queen.nannannannannannannan

elementary	the last time she performed, we did not have mobile phones. now, 35 years later, as she performs again, singer kate bush sees a very different world.these days, most concerts are now lit up with phones and tablets, but bush does not want her fans to watch her shows through a screen.in august, before her concerts at the hammersmith apollo in london, bush asked her fans to put down their mobile phones at her gigs.bush wrote on her website: “i have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows. we have chosen a theatre, not a large venue or stadium. please do not take photos or videos during the shows.“i very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iphones, ipads or cameras.”bush is not the first singer or musician to say she doesn’t like phones at concerts. roger daltrey from the who recently said it was “weird” that people looked at their screen and not the artist on stage.he said: “i feel sorry for them, i really feel sorry for them. looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally – if you’re doing that, you’re 50% there, right? it’s weird.”in 2013, beyoncé told a fan, “you can’t even sing because you’re too busy filming. put that damn camera down!”recently, dutch football fans at psv eindhoven protested against the introduction of wi-fi in their stadium. they held up banners that said “no wi-fi. support the team,” and “you can sit at home.” manchester united have also told fans to leave their “large electronic devices” at home.singer jarvis cocker said, “it seems stupid to have something happening in front of you and look at it on a screen that’s smaller than a cigarette packet.”even in the world of classical music, one of the world’s top pianists surprised the audience in june 2013 when he left the stage because a fan was filming his performance on a smartphone. krystian zimerman returned moments later and said: “the destruction of music because of youtube is enormous.”but sam watt says that filming at concerts makes the experience even better. he works for vyclone, a phone app that puts together many videos uploaded by fans to create one long video of a show.“fans filming is now part of the concert experience – that is a just a fact. we take the videos that people are filming at concerts and mix them together with everybody else who was filming. the result is a really fantastic video,” he said.“we think that filming at concerts adds to the experience, and i think that, if kate bush came round for a cup of tea, we could have a really interesting discussion about this,” he added. “people are going to film and they want those memories – you’ve got to accept it.”nannannannannannan
elementary	mcdonaldõs is the worldõs biggest burger chain and a symbol of american consumer capitalism. but, these days, the golden arches of mcdonaldõs are not looking so golden. the company has got much bigger since 2003 but, now, the numbers of customers are falling. mcdonaldõs says that its worldwide sales have fallen by 3.3%.the company has problems almost everywhere. in china, sales fell by 23%. in europe, sales fell by 4%, mostly because of problems in ukraine and the anti-western mood in russia. health inspectors have investigated around 200 of mcdonaldõs 450 restaurants in russia and they have closed ten restaurants.but the worst crisis is in the us, where mcdonaldõs has around 40% of its restaurants. almost 60 years since ray kroc opened his  rst restaurant in des plaines, illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a big mac and fries. sales have fallen every month for 12 months in the us. many younger diners are eating at rival companies such as chipotle mexican grill. the number of 19-to-21-year-olds who visit mcdonaldõs once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011.another problem is that mcdonaldõs hamburgers were recently named the worst in america in a poll of more than 32,000 american diners ð they said they would rather eat a burger at five guys, smashburger or fuddruckers. many people also believe that mcdonaldõs is less healthy than most of its rivals, especially chipotle. chipotle uses antibiotic-free meat and òlocally sourced, seasonaló ingredients.mcdonaldõs asked customers for their opinions in the us in october. someone asked òhave you ever used pink slime in your burgers?ó ð ôpink slimeõ is the beef  ller that is used for dog food. mcdonaldõs stopped using this meat product in 2012 but mcdonaldõs chief executive don thompson said the company still had to improve peopleõs opinions about the freshness and quality of its ingredients.mcdonaldõs has always had a reputation for fast service at low prices. but, since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, people think it is more expensive than its rivals and many consumers complain that service is slower.but mary chapman at food analysts technomic said that it wasnõt fair to say that mcdonaldõs was more expensive than its rivals. òprices have gone up but they havenõt gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-food chains in the us.ó prices at mcdonaldõs have increased by 4.8% since 2009, much less than the fast-food average (up 19.4%).but people are right when they complain that the queues are longer. mcdonaldõs has a bigger menu than some other restaurants, with more complicated items ð its chicken mcwrap takes 60 seconds to make. òi think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not,ó said chapman.mcdonald managers are promising to improve peopleõs opinions about its food in the us. thompson has promised more organic food and òbuild your own burgersó. but, to reduce queues, he also wants to introduce simpler menus. how can the company have simpler menus and, at the same time, a larger selection of  llings? òthey want to simplify the menu but also offer ôbuild your own burgersõ ð that sounds tricky,ó said consumer expert mark kalinowski. only four out of mcdonaldõs 14,000 us restaurants have tested òbuild your own burgeró, he said. òright now, we are sceptical; we would like to see more detail.ósales are falling but mcdonaldõs continues to expand around the world: by the end of 2014, it expects to open 1,400 new restaurants. kalinowski thinks that mcdonaldõs sales will continue to fall but he thinks it will be number one for many years.nannannan
elementary	the small room looks like a classroom. the posters on the walls show letters of the alphabet and a map of bangladesh.but, it is hard to concentrate – there is the loud hammering and chemicals in the air that hurt the throat and eyes. but, the children who learn in this three-square-metre room are lucky. they have escaped working in the factories opposite.for 14 years, sohay, a non-governmental organization (ngo), has worked in slums in dhaka to send child workers to school. it especially tries to help children who do dangerous work.the classroom is one of 23 centres that sohay has set up in dhaka. the classes at the centres help children enter primary school. when they are in school, the children get extra help with their homework at the centres.alamin, ten years old, used to work in a plastic factory. he now goes to one of the centres. his parents are happy that he’s now in school and not doing dangerous work. his friend rabi says he wants to forget his past in the factory. “i like school,” he says.sohay also has classes for parents and managers to stop child labour. it can be very difficult for working children to go to school. they are not like other children. after they stop working, they sometimes find it difficult to make friends and adapt to school. it is also difficult to make sure they stay in school – lots of these children don’t finish school.seven-year-old zhorna akter sumayya has two older brothers – they both work (one at a restaurant, one at a local club). but, she went to a sohay centre and she now goes to school. her family live in the slum and her parents need the money their sons make but they want their daughter to go to school.in 2015, sohay helped 1,540 children to leave dangerous work and helped 2,125 more children – those who would soon start work – to go to school. about 780 more children are preparing to start school in 2017.the labour law of bangladesh 2006 does not allow children younger than 14 to work but unicef says that, in bangladesh, 4.7 million children younger than 14 are employed and 1.3 million children aged five to 17 do dangerous work.nannannannannannan
elementary	many of us know we donõt get enough sleep but imagine if there was a simple solution: getting up later. in a speech at the british science festival, dr paul kelley from oxford university said schools should stagger their starting times to work with the natural rhythms of their students. this would improve exam results and studentsõ health (lack of sleep can cause diabetes, depression, obesity and other health problems).dr kelley said that, when children are around ten, their natural wake-up time is about 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and, at 18, a personõs natural waking hour is 9am, although you may think they are just a lazy teenager. the normal school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not for 16- to 18-year-olds. for the older teenagers, it might be better to start the school day at 11am or even later. òa 7am wake-up time for older teenagers,ó says kelley, òis the same as a 4.30am start for a teacher in their 50s.óhe says the solution is not to tell teenagers to go to bed earlier. òthe bodyõs natural rhythm is controlled by a particular kind of light,ó says kelley. òthe eye has cells that report to a part of the brain that controls our sleep rhythms over a 24-hour cycle. itõs the light that controls it.óbut it isnõt just students who would bene t from a later start. kelley says the working day should be more linked to our natural rhythms. describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: òbetween 14 and 24, people lose more than two hours. for people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35, they lose about an hour and a half. that can continue up until youõre about 55 when itõs in balance again. the 10-year-old and 55-year-old wake and sleep naturally at the same time.óso, should workplaces have staggered starting times, too? should people in their 50s and above come in at 8am, people in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage apprentice at 11am? kelley says that synchronized hours could have òmany positive effects. the positive side is that peopleõs performance, mood and health will improve. itõs very positive because itõs a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.óthere would probably be fewer accidents because drivers would be more awake, he says. it could mean the end of rush hour because people would stagger their work times and the times of their school run. a later start to the day for many, says kelley, òis something that would bene t all people, particularly families. parents go and try to wake up teenagers who are waking up three hours too early. it creates problems for everybody.óso, what time does kelley start work? òi am 67 so that means iõm like a 10-year-old and i get up just after six. i wake naturally.ó and, yes, he says he  nds the start of his working day much easier now than when he was younger.
elementary	the international monetary fund (imf) has asked the usa to manage its money better. hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work after the government shut down for 16 days.us president barack obama said that the us has to be more careful with how it manages its money. the imf’s managing director, christine lagarde, asked for more stability.the senate wrote a peace deal, which included almost nothing that the conservatives asked for. the conservative republicans nearly caused a new financial crisis because they did not agree to obama’s healthcare reforms. the house of representatives agreed the deal at the last minute.the world bank was also pleased that the world’s economy had “avoided a catastrophe”. its president, jim yong kim, asked politicians in all countries to continue to make policies that improve the economy and give jobs and opportunity to all.the shutdown cost the us $24 billion.obama signed the legislation shortly after midnight on thursday. the bill passed easily, with support from all parties in the senate, where democratic and republican leaders wrote the agreement. it is a temporary solution. it gives the government money until 15 january and allows the government to borrow more money if they want to until 7 february.but the president made clear that he did not expect another serious budget fight and shutdown in 2014.at the white house, obama said he hoped the deal would “lift the cloud of uncertainty” that had hung over the country in recent weeks.“when this agreement arrives on my desk, i will sign it immediately,” he said. “hopefully, next time, it won’t be in the eleventh hour. we must manage our money better.”a journalist asked the president if the crisis would happen again in a few months. obama replied: “no.”earlier, the republican senator mike lee said there would be more trouble: “the media keeps asking: ‘was it worth it?’ my answer is, it is always worth it to do the right thing.” he added: “this is not over.”but the political deal on wednesday was one of the worst of all possible results for republicans. they did not achieve any of their goals and most people blamed them for the crisis.nannannan
elementary	more than one million british workers might be employed on zero-hours contracts. this number comes from a poll of more than 1,000 employers by the chartered institute of personnel and development (cipd).recently, some uk organizations ð from shops to buckingham palace ð have been criticized for employing staff without a guarantee of work and pay each week. employees on zero-hours contracts often get no holiday or sick pay and have to ask permission before looking for extra work with another company.the cipd found that 38% of zero-hours contract workers describe themselves as employed full-time. they say they typically work 30 hours or more a week. one-third of voluntary sector employers use the contracts and one in four public sector organizations.the retail company sports direct employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on zero-hours contracts. other companies using the contracts include cinema chain cineworld and buckingham palace, which uses the contracts for its 350 summer workers. pub group j d wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff ð 80% of its workforce ð on zero-hours contracts.vidhya alakeson, from the resolution foundation, said: òif itõs true that there are around one million people on zero-hours contracts, then that would be a big part of the workforce.óunions say that employers put pressure on staff to sign the contracts. in this way, the employers can avoid their responsibilities to employees and reduce staff bene ts.dave prentis, of the trade union unison, said: òthe majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice.óworkers on zero-hours contracts are often only told how many hours they will work when weekly or monthly rotas are created. but they have to be available for extra work at short notice. they may get holiday pay, but they do not get sick pay.the charity national trust, which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts, said it gives the same pay and bene ts to workers on zero-hours contracts as to full-time staff.òwe believe zero-hours contracts are essential in our organization, because we are very weather-dependent,ó the national trust said. òitõs important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.ópolitician chuka umunna said, òwhile some employees welcome the  exibility of zero-hours contracts, for many, zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come,ó he said.the poll shows that 17% of employers in the private sector use zero-hours contracts, lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.industries where employers were most likely to have at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).nannannannan
advanced	from all across rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring burundi, people  ock to the southern town of butare to a little shop called inzozi nziza (sweet dreams). they come for a taste of the unknown, something most have never tasted ð the sweet, cold, velvety embrace of ice cream.here, at the central african countryõs  rst ice- cream parlour, customers can buy scoops in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple  avours. toppings include fresh fruit, honey, chocolate chips and granola. black tea and coffee are also on sale.the shop, which has òice cream, coffee, dreamsó across its signage, is milking local curiosity about the dessert ð and òchanging livesó in the process, says inzozi nzizaõs manager, louise ingabire.òice cream is important,ó she says between mouthfuls of a honey- avoured offering. òsome rwandans like ice cream, but itõs a new thing. we still have some work to do, to tell others that theyõll enjoy it.ótrue to inzozi nzizaõs motto, the shop can certainly make dreams come true. òi didnõt have a job before: i just stayed at home. now, i have a vision for the future. i am making money and i can give some of it to my family,ó says the 27-year-old.butare, which has 89,600 residents and is located 135km south of the capital, kigali, is the home of the national university of rwanda. inzozi nziza has become a hub for tired students looking to treat themselves to something cool and different.òitõs something uniting people here,ó kalisa migendo, a 24-year-old agriculture student, says. òif you need to go out and talk to a friend, a girl or a boy, you come to inzozi nziza for an ice cream.ómost of the ingredients are sourced locally and the milk comes from a depot in nearby nyanza. the vanilla beans and cocoa are imported.inzozi nziza was opened by the theatre director odile gakire katese. she met alexis miesen and jennie dundas, co-founders of blue marble ice cream in brooklyn, new york, and formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010.òan ice-cream shop, katese proposed, might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits, hopes and family traditions,ó miesen says.at the start, miesen and dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative and non-pro t. they did not set  nancial targets, but waited for 18 months before they transferred their shares to the women, who had by then proved their business credentials.the shopõs success is no exception, says fatuma ndangiza, deputy chief executive of the rwanda governance board. òsmall businesses are mostly managed by women but when it comes to big business where you have to compete for big tenders, very few women are there. women are newcomers to big business,ó she points out. òwe have more women entrepreneurs. itõs an area where women are taking an interest, both in and outside kigali.óthough ice cream is somewhat new to rwanda, ndangiza is enthused by the idea of the shop. òi think itõs great. it requires a lot of skills and changing peopleõs mindsets because selling and eating ice cream is not part of our culture. i think being able to innovate and introduce this on the market, and the process of making it, is quite interesting.óthe butare shop employs nine women, who spend their spare time practising with ingoma nshya, rwandaõs  rst and only female drumming troupe, which was established by katese ten years ago.the musicians are hutu and tutsi women, some survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million tutsis and moderate hutus were killed.some members of ingoma nshya are widows, some orphans. others have been affected by the massacre in different ways.historically, says ingabire, rwandan women were forbidden to drum and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry. òbut itõs something which brings unity.óingabireõs father, two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide. òsome of us are survivors; some know someone who was killed,ó she says. òwhen iõm drumming with them, it gives me power because weõre still alive and survivors.óthe popular eatery features in a documentary by rob and lisa fruchtman, sibling  lm-makers. sweet dreams, which tells the story of how the women have forged a promising post-genocide future, also includes the female drummers.the  lm, which has been screened in more than a dozen countries, including the us, uk and several african states, premieres in rwanda in 2014. òwe feel the  lm is about resilience, hope, bravery, resourcefulness and the ability to change the course of your own life,ó says lisa fruchtman, who won an academy award for  lm- editing in 1984.
advanced	he is not the first person to express scepticism about mars one, a vastly ambitious private mission aiming to settle humans on mars from 2025. but joseph roche is different from most critics: he’s on the shortlist of astronauts.roche, an astrophysicist at trinity college dublin who was announced in february as among the 100 people in line for the mission, has written for the guardian expressing his grave doubts about the viability of mars one.the selection process, roche writes, “was not rigorous enough to reach the requisite standard of more traditional astronaut selection programmes”. he also says the dutch mars one team have displayed “a certain naivety” in believing they can succeed alone in the supposed $6bn mission and should now accept it is very unlikely to happen.he writes: “more openness and transparency would benefit mars one greatly but i think that the shortcomings of the selection process, coupled with their unwillingness to engage and collaborate with the scientific community mean that the time might have come for mars one to acknowledge the implausibility of this particular venture and turn their efforts towards supporting other exciting and more viable upcoming space missions.”roche also expressed worries about the way the mission organizers publicized a so-called top-ten candidates. the ranking, he said, didn’t mean these were the most likely potential astronauts but was, instead, based on how many “supporter points” each had earned through acts such as buying official merchandise.he writes: “these points are mars one’s supporter points which ‘represent the degree of your support to mars one’s mission’.” these points play no role in the selection process and serve only to show how much each supporter has donated to mars one.”the official timeline for the mission says the group plans to dispatch a stationary lander and satellite to mars in 2018, followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022. humans would start arriving in 2025 and crews of four would be sent every two years to add to the settlement. they would not return to earth.in february, a prominent supporter of the project, gerard ’t hooft, a dutch nobel laureate in physics, said he did not believe this timetable was realistic. he said: “it will take quite a bit longer and be quite a bit more expensive. when they first asked me to be involved, i told them: ‘you have to put a zero after everything’.”roche also spoke to medium, a us blogging platform that has previously expressed grave sceptism about mars one, reporting among other things that the supposed 200,000 applications to be astronauts in fact totalled 2,761.he told medium about the selection process in more detail: “i have not met anyone from mars one in person. initially, they’d said there were going to be regional interviews; we would travel there, we’d be interviewed, we’d be tested over several days and, in my mind, that sounded at least like something that approached a legitimate astronaut selection process.“but then they made us sign a non-disclosure agreement if we wanted to be interviewed and then, all of a sudden, it changed from being a proper regional interview over several days to being a ten-minute skype call.”roche told the guardian he did not want to give more interviews as he was wary about being negative about the idea of space travel.in his comment piece he writes: “i am passionate about pushing the boundaries of scientific endeavour and that is why the ambitiousness of the mars one plan appealed to me. although mars one were never likely to overcome the financial and technical barriers during their proposed timeline, it was refreshing to hear a new idea that challenges us to think about our own role in the future of space exploration.“being part of the subsequent public debate over the ethics and morality of future missions has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable aspects of my candidacy with mars one. if a one-way mission to mars ever became possible, then i would always volunteer. for an astrophysicist, that is not a difficult decision to make but it is also a moot point because i do not think we will see a one-way mission in my lifetime.”
advanced	they are the darkness seekers – and they are growing in number. on black fell, looking down on northumberland’s beautiful kielder water reservoir, a group of people wait in a car park next to a strange wooden building with a minimalist design beamed down from the future. this is kielder observatory, the centre of britain’s nascent astrotourism industry. and those waiting outside were the lucky ones. many more had applied for a night of stargazing at the observatory but numbers are strictly limited.inside, next to a woodburner and under dimmed lights, the observatory’s founder and lead astronomer, gary fildes, a former bricklayer with tarzan hair, delivers a pep talk to his colleagues and volunteers. the team discusses the prospect of seeing the northern lights but fildes is doubtful. instead, they decide to train their powerful telescopes on jupiter and venus and later to pick out stars such as capella and betelgeuse. an additional attraction is the appearance of the international space station.“remember,” fildes tells his team, “it’s about interaction, it’s about entertainment, it’s about inspiring people.” he puts on some music. pink floyd, the jam, the pogues. “by 9.30, the sky is going to be sexy,” fildes says. “it’s going to be epic.”fildes, 49, is at the forefront of the uk’s burgeoning astrotourism industry. the pivotal moment for northumberland came in 2013 when the entire national park housing hadrian’s wall, along with kielder water and forest park, some 1,500 sq km, was awarded dark sky park status, the only one in england. dark sky parks are rare. the 2013 star count revealed that only 5% of the uk population can see more than 31 stars on a good night.the tucson, arizona-based international dark-sky association (ida) confers the status only on places that take major steps to avoid light pollution. recipients must also prove their night skies are sufficiently dark. in northumberland dark sky park, as the area was rebadged, it is so dark that venus casts a shadow on the earth.duncan wise, visitor development officer for the northumberland national park authority, helped to spearhead the campaign for dark-sky status after the council for the protection of rural england found it was one of britain’s most tranquil places. “we tend to look at landscape as everything up to the horizon,” wise said. “but what about what’s above it?” wise and others spent years drawing up their submission to the ida, collecting reams of light readings and forming an alliance of local councils, parks’ bodies and community groups to produce an exterior lighting master plan that influences the construction of new developments in the area.their efforts have been vindicated. many of the 1.5 million who visit northumberland each year are now aware of its dark sky status. “we get a lot of people coming here to see the sky now,” says the man at the car-hire firm in newcastle. “they come in autumn and winter, when it’s darkest. good for the b&bs as they get business all year round now.” local hoteliers now issue guests with night-vision torches and put out deckchairs at night. those who have acquired some knowledge of astronomy can receive a badge confirming that their hotels are “dark sky friendly”.wise acknowledges that northumberland needs to do more to capitalize on its scarce resource and believes the region needs a couple more observatories to ensure that visitors will see what they came for. a £14m national landscape discovery centre, which he describes as the north’s answer to the eden project, will have an observatory when it is completed in a couple of years.fildes has grand designs. he is planning britain’s first “astrovillage”, one that would house the largest public observatory in the world and boast a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, a one-metre aperture telescope, and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes. the multimillion-pound project would feature a hotel and draw in 100,000 people a year, four times the number currently able to use the observatory. fildes is cryptic about his backers but believes the astrovillage will be a reality by 2018.however, northumberland faces competition. galloway forest park in scotland also has dark sky park status. since exmoor was designated europe’s first international dark sky reserve – one notch below dark sky park – in 2011, a range of local businesses offering stargazing breaks and safaris has sprung up. the uk will have to go some way to eclipse northern chile, which boasts more than a dozen tourist observatories and has some of the clearest skies in the world. the teide national park in tenerife is also becoming a major astrotourism destination.so, what is driving the desire to look upwards? the media have helped. tv presenters like brian cox have attracted a new generation of stargazers. “brian cox has made astronomy accessible,” says wise. “it’s no longer seen as the province of professors in studies with brass telescopes.” technology has also played a part. apps such as stellarium now turn smartphones into pocket-size planetariums. ultimately, though, fildes believes people are starting to appreciate what lies above. “if you had to build a visitor attraction from scratch, what could be better than the universe?”
advanced	the mass collection of telephone records by government surveillance programmes poses a clear threat to the personal privacy of ordinary citizens, according to us researchers who used basic phone logs to identify people and uncover confidential information about their lives.armed with anonymous “metadata” on people’s calls and texts, but not the content of the communications, two scientists at stanford university worked out individuals’ names, where they lived and the names of their partners. but that was not all.the same data led them to uncover potentially sensitive information about some individuals. one man was found to own a rifle, while another had recently been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. other data pointed to a new pregnancy and a person with multiple sclerosis.the results highlight the extraordinary power of telephone metadata – the number called, when and for how long – particularly when it is paired with public information available from services such as google, yelp and facebook. the value of the data, which is not subject to the same legal protections as the content of people’s communications, has long been recognized by the security services. as stewart baker, the former general counsel at the us national security agency (nsa), put it in the aftermath of edward snowden’s revelations: “metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody’s life.”patrick mutchler, a computer security researcher at stanford, said that while the power of metadata was understood by those gathering the information, the public was largely in the dark because so few published studies have revealed how rich the data is. “that makes it difficult for people with strong opinions about these programmes to fight them. now, we have hard evidence we can point to that didn’t exist in the past,” he said.for the study, the researchers signed up 823 people who agreed to have metadata collected from their phones through an android app. the app also received information from their facebook accounts, which the scientists used to check the accuracy of their results. in all, the researchers gathered metadata on more than 250,000 calls and over 1.2m texts.analysts who logged into the nsa’s metadata-gathering system were initially allowed to examine data up to three hops away from an individual. a call from the target individual’s phone to another number was one hop. from that phone to another was two hops. and so on. the records available to analysts stretched back for five years. the collection window has now been restricted to two hops and 18 months at most.writing in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences, mutchler describes how, on a shoestring budget, he and fellow graduate student, jonathan mayer, uncovered a wealth of personal information, some of it sensitive, about people who took part in the study. through automatic and manual searches, they identified 82% of people’s names. the same technique gave them the names of businesses the people had called. when these were plotted on a map, they revealed clusters of local businesses, which the scientists speculated surrounded the person’s home address. in this way, they named the city people lived in 57% of the time, and were nearly 90% accurate in placing people within 50 miles of their home. mutchler believes some of the misses came from people not updating their facebook page when they moved out of their parents’ home, for example, to go to college.the scientists next delved into more personal territory. using a simple computer program to analyse people’s call patterns, they inferred who among the study volunteers was in a relationship. once they knew the owner of a particular number had a partner, identifying the significant other was easy, they report.for the final part of the study, the researchers delved even deeper, to see what sensitive information they could glean from telephone metadata. they gathered details on calls made to and from a list of organizations, including hospitals, pharmacies, religious groups, legal services, firearms retailers and repair firms. from these, they pieced together some extraordinary vignettes from people’s lives.the metadata from one person in the study showed they had a long call from a cardiology centre, spoke briefly with a medical laboratory, answered a number of short calls from a local pharmacy and then made calls to a hotline for abnormal heart-rate monitoring devices. another participant made frequent calls to a local gun supplier that specialized in semiautomatic rifles and later placed a number of long calls to the customer support hotline run by a major gun manufacturer that produced the rifles. the metadata from two others suggested one had multiple sclerosis and the other had just become pregnant.“all of this should be taken as an indication of what is possible with two graduate students and limited resources,” said mutchler, who argues that the findings should make policymakers think twice before authorizing mass surveillance programmes. “large-scale metadata surveillance programmes, like the nsa’s, will necessarily expose highly confidential information about ordinary citizens,” the scientists write, adding: “to strike an appropriate balance between national security and civil liberties, future policymaking must be informed by input from relevant sciences.”ross anderson, professor of security engineering at cambridge university, said the study provided numbers that discussions can now be based on. “with the right analytics running over nationscale communications data, you can infer huge amounts of sensitive information on everyone. we always suspected that, of course, but here’s the data.”
advanced	europe is to become the first place in the world to force ‘real-world’ emissions tests on car makers, opening up a new front in the fight to tackle air pollution. new regulations will introduce the tests to reveal what cars’ emissions are like when driving on roads and in traffic rather than in ideal, laboratory-like conditions, as is currently the case.green lit by european commission vice president, frans timmermans, the tests are designed to enforce a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre, a level met by only one car out of 16, according to researchers. other countries, such as china and korea, which are also considering real-world emissions tests, will be watching what happens next closely.pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and particulates are thought to be responsible for at least one quarter of the 29,000 annual pollution-related deaths in the uk alone. that figure is likely to rise, when the committee on the medical effects of air pollutants publishes what it calls “strengthening evidence” of damage to public health from nitrogen oxide emissions later in 2015.but the current ‘new european drive cycle’ laboratory test for measuring these emissions is a quarter of a century old and has been outpaced by technological developments in the car industry. studies have shown that the results of lab techniques to measure car emissions can easily be fixed by using techniques such as taping up doors and windows to minimize air resistance, driving on unrealistically smooth roads and testing at improbably high temperatures. campaigners say that car makers also use tricks such as programming vehicles to go into a low emissions mode when their front wheels are spinning and their back wheels are stationary, as happens in such lab experiments.“the commission is finalizing a proposal to introduce a new emissions testing procedure that will allow proper assessment of the vehicles in real driving,” said lucia caudet, a commission spokesperson. the proposal still needs approval from other commissioners and a technical committee but “we don’t expect any major internal hurdles,” a european union (eu) source added.“one key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 citizens annually is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars, causing many times more pollution on the road,” said greg archer, the clean vehicles manager for transport and environment. “the development of a new, real-world driving emission test is an important step forward in tackling urban air pollution. eu states should now support the commission’s proposals and ignore the whingeing from car makers that the rules are too tough.”according to research by the international council on clean transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg/km standard, with some models running at 22 times above the recommended limit. only one car out of 16 met the 80g target. around one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport – mostly diesel – and, in urban areas, concentrations can rise as high as 64%, european environment agency figures indicate.campaigners say that the car industry has tried to delay reforms to car test cycles but industry groups deny this, arguing that a five-year lead-time is necessary for technical and economic reasons. “real driving emissions (rde) is a totally new regulation that will force significant emission control hardware changes that may be demanded in the middle of a vehicle’s production lifetime,” said cara mclaughlin, a spokesperson for the european automobile manufacturers association (acea). “however, acea fully accepts that rde will apply to new types of cars from september 2017.”in an unusual move, the car association sent timmermans a draft regulation of their own for him to consider, after eu representatives finally agreed a regulation to implement the nitrogen oxide limits with beefed-up road trials and strict monitoring of exhaust fumes. acea’s draft regulation would have covered fewer pollutants and further delayed the regulation’s phased introduction until 2020. test distances would have been shortened from 1,300m to below 700m, minimum temperatures would have been raised from -7c to -3c and more rural roads would have been used. “the lobbyists were all over this,” archer said. “this was a real attempt at subversion of the legislative process.”after timmerman’s apparent rejection of the acea proposal, the regulation will now pass to commissioners for a rubber stamp, and member states for final amendments, before an expected introduction in september. by 2017, the first real-world car emissions tests are expected to begin in earnest. with a similar battle already looming over the testing of co2 emissions for cars at the end of 2015 – and with comparable debates in other countries – the introduction of the eu’s new emissions tests will be watched closely.
advanced	not just the identity of the man in the car park with the twisted spine, but the appalling last moments and humiliating treatment of the naked body of richard iii in the hours after his death have been revealed at an extraordinary press conference at leicester university.there were cheers when richard buckley, lead archaeologist on the hunt for the king’s body, finally announced that the university team was convinced “beyond reasonable doubt” that it had found the last plantagenet king, bent by scoliosis of the spine, and twisted further to fit into a hastily dug hole in grey friars church, which was slightly too small to hold his body.but, by then, it was clear the evidence was overwhelming, as the scientists who carried out the dna tests, those who created the computer-imaging technology to peer onto and into the bones in extraordinary detail, the genealogists who found a distant descendant with matching dna, and the academics who scoured contemporary texts for accounts of the king’s death and burial outlined their findings.“what a morning. what a story,” said philippa langley, of the richard iii society. she had been driving on the project for years, in the face of incredulity from many people, and finding funds from all over the world when it looked as if the money would run out before the excavation had even begun.work has started on designing a new tomb in leicester cathedral, only 100 yards from the excavation site, and a ceremony will be held to lay him into his new grave there, probably next year. leicester’s museums’ service is working on plans for a new visitor centre in an old school building overlooking the site.richard died at bosworth on 22 august 1485, the last english king to fall in battle, and the researchers revealed how for the first time. there was an audible intake of breath as a slide came up showing the base of his skull sliced off by one terrible blow, believed to be from a halberd, a fearsome medieval battle weapon with a razor-sharp iron axe blade weighing about two kilos, mounted on a wooden pole, which was swung at richard at very close range. the blade probably penetrated several centimetres into his brain and, said the human bones expert jo appleby, he would have been unconscious at once and dead almost as soon.the injury appears to confirm contemporary accounts that he died in close combat in the thick of the battle and unhorsed – as in the great despairing cry shakespeare gives him: “a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!” another sword slash, which also went through the bone and into the brain, would also have proved fatal. but many of the other injuries were after death, suggesting a gruesome ritual on the battlefield and as the king’s body was brought back to leicester, as he was stripped, mocked and mutilated.one terrible injury, a stab through the right buttock and into his pelvis, was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour. it suggests the story that his naked corpse was brought back slung over a horse, mocked and abused all the way, is true. bob savage, a medieval arms expert from the royal armouries who helped identify the wounds, said it was probably not a war weapon but the sort of sharp knife or dagger any workman might have carried.michael ibsen, the canadian-born furniture maker proved to be the descendant of richard’s sister, heard the confirmation on sunday and listened to the unfolding evidence in shocked silence. “my head is no clearer now than when i first heard the news,” he said. “many, many hundreds of people died on that field that day. he was a king, but just one of the dead. he lived in very violent times and these deaths would not have been pretty or quick.”it was mathew morris who first uncovered the body, in the first hour of the first day of the excavation. he did not believe he had found the king. the mechanical digger was still chewing the tarmac off the council car park, identified by years of research by local historians and the richard iii society as the probable site of the lost church of grey friars, whose priests bravely claimed the body of the king and buried him in a hastily dug grave, probably still naked, but in a position of honour near the high altar of their church. the leg bones just showing through the soil were covered up again.ten days later, on 5 september, when further excavation proved morris had hit the crucial spot, he returned with lin foxhall, head of the archaeology department, to excavate the body. “we did it the usual way, lifting the arms, legs and skull first, and proceeding gradually towards the torso – so it was only when we finally saw the twisted spine that i thought: ‘my word, i think we’ve got him.’”as far as langley is concerned, richard was the true king, the last king of the north, a worthy and brave leader who became a victim of some of the most brilliant propaganda in history, in the hands of the tudors’ imagemaker, shakespeare. there remains the dark shadow of the little princes in the tower, an infamous story even in richard’s day: the child edward v and his brother richard were declared illegitimate when richard iii claimed the throne, imprisoned in the tower of london and never seen alive again. although it is by no means certain that the bones found at the tower centuries later are theirs, there may be more dna detective work to be done there.
advanced	we may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm back to the future ii, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched. experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally altering the transportation landscape. òitõs a very dynamic time,ó said robert puentes, of the brookings institutionõs metropolitan policy program think- tank. òthereõs a focus on a tighter connection between the role of transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people.óas the average us commute lengthens and the countryõs infrastructure ages badly, cities across the us are being forced to rede ne what transportation is. increasingly, urban planners, transportation experts and scientists are realizing that old auto-centric models focused on easing traf c congestion arenõt enough to tackle issues like population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now, more than ever, an integral component of a cityõs larger sustainability efforts.big us cities like los angeles, seattle and chicago are working to make better use of their streets by adding more bus lanes, augmenting pedestrian walkways and expanding their rail options, while at the same time working with the private sector on advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment, essentially making transportation intelligent. òthe most sustainable places to live are those places that have multi-modal transport systems,ó puentes said. òyou canõt be a global competitive city if you donõt have a robust transportation network.óhere are three of the key trends that experts predict will shape the transportation industry over the coming years. connectivity the rise of ride-sharing services like uber and lyft ð essentially taxis booked at the click of a smartphone button ð and apps like waze, which uses real-time traf c data to  nd the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people get around and affecting the very way in which traf c moves through a city. communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era, according to allan clelland, an expert on transportation technology.according to a recent study from the uclaõs institute of transportation studies, vehicle travel has declined among millennials ð individuals born roughly between the early 1980s and early 2000s ð compared to previous generations. according to the study, those born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives.meanwhile, those still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to waze. experts say the traf c app has eased congestion on motorways and reduced travel times for drivers but also led to a problematic rise in cars moving through residential neighbourhoods. this has angered residents, who claim the increased traf c on their quiet roads reduces their quality of life.this trend could continue as vehicle-to-vehicle data communication, as well as communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure, grows. currently, a traf c light can detect when a car is approaching but thatõs about it. companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.automation driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. however, the partial automation of cars is already underway. alexandre bayen of the university of california expects automation will progress in stages:  rst, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: essentially, vehicles that are connected electronically and travel in single  le.the idea of a fully automated transportation system is intriguing because it has the potential to improve safety by removing human error and increase the ef ciency of car owners, who can get on with other tasks during a long commute. it can also help reduce carbon emissions and traf c congestion and allow more people access to cars. but, even if driverless technology were ready to hit the roads now, it would take a long time to get fully automated given the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.to see what driverless cars might look like in action, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.environmental concern as the world races to avoid catastrophic climate change, and countries, states and cities work to meet ambitious emissions goals, these policies could also have a big impact on the future of transportation, spurring everything from zero- and low-emission vehicles to apps that encourage more walking, biking and carpooling.sharon feigon, executive director of the shared use mobility center, envisages a future where a person can use a transit pass that gives them access to numerous modes of transport in a given day. if their train is delayed, for instance, they can access a city bike, take a shuttle or rent a vehicle through a car share programme using the same pass. òweõre going to see these systems packaged together and make it as easy as possible to connect them up with each other so people can transfer seamlessly between them,ó she said.when considering the future of transportation, itõs also important to keep in mind why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. technologies and trends that reduce the need for those trips ð say, virtual meetings or telecommuting ð could also have a big impact on transportation.there was a time when the idea of a  ying car represented the height of innovation but the technologies being imagined and developed now could be seen as even more sophisticated ð and more useful in tackling the social and environmental threats that we face over the coming decades.ó
advanced	seaworld has suffered an 84% collapse in pro ts as customers have deserted the controversial aquatic theme park company following claims it mistreated orca whales.the company, which trains dolphins and killer whales to perform tricks in front of stadiums full of spectators, has reported declines in attendance, sales and pro ts because of òcontinued brand challengesó.seaworld has been in the headlines since the 2013 documentary black sh detailed claims that its treatment of orca whales provoked violent behaviour, contributing to the deaths of three people. following the release of the documentary, attendance collapsed, the company lost more than half of its market value on wall street and its former ceo was forced out.the company has since launched a nationwide marketing campaign to combat animal rights activists claims that, among other things, captive orcas die at a younger age than their wild counterparts.despite cutting ticket prices and spending $10m on the marketing blitz, which features its veterinarians caring for whales, seaworld ceo joel manby was forced to admit that the company is still struggling to convince the public that it treats its whales well.òwe realize we have much work ahead of us to recover more of our attendance base, increase revenue and improve our performance, as returning to historical performance levels will take time and investment,ó manby said. òon the reputation side, early feedback on our campaign has been positive. however, we recognize that fully resolving our brand challenges in california will require sustained focus and commitment to correct misinformation.óòwe will continue to  ght with the facts because the facts are on our side,ó he said recently on a conference call with journalists and analysts. manby, who joined the company as ceo in 2015 to help the company rehabilitate itself, said he would set out his vision for the future of the company at a special event on 6 november.already in the pipeline are plans for a new shark exhibition in orlando and an attraction in san antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a ònaturalisticó setting.the companyõs  nancial report, released on 6 august, showed net income in the second quarter dropped from $37.4m in 2014 to $5.8m in 2015, an 84% decrease. revenue fell from $405m to $392m. attendance dropped by more than 100,000 from 6.58 million to 6.48 million.analysts will now be closely watching seaworldõs sales and attendance numbers in the third quarter, which is traditionally the companyõs most pro table and covers the summer holiday season. attendance may suffer from a fresh scandal in july 2015, in which a seaworld employee was alleged to have in ltrated animal rights protest groups against the company.jared goodman, director of animal law for people for the ethical treatment of animals (peta), which has been leading campaigns against seaworld, said: òseaworld is in the midst of a spying scandal, animals are dying in its tanks and tens of thousands of people have opposed its bid to build a new orca prison so it should come as no surprise that seaworldõs quarterly earnings have plummeted yet again in the second quarter. families just donõt want to buy tickets to see orcas going insane inside tiny tanks and seaworldõs pro ts, like the orcas, wonõt recover until the abusement park empties its tanks and builds coastal sanctuaries.óseaworldõs shares, which were worth $39 in 2013, were changing hands for just under $18 in august 2015.
advanced	margaret thatcher, the most dominant british prime minister since winston churchill in 1940 and a global champion of the late 20th-century free market economic revival, has died. the british government announced that she would receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours at st paul’s cathedral.the british prime minister, david cameron, who is cutting short his trip to europe to return to london following the news, said: “it was with great sadness that l learned of lady thatcher’s death. we’ve lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great briton.” he added: “as our first woman prime minister, margaret thatcher succeeded against all the odds, and the real thing about margaret thatcher is that she didn’t just lead our country, she saved our country, and i believe she will go down as the greatest british peacetime prime minister.”in a statement, president barack obama said, “here in america, many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with president reagan, reminding the world that we are not simply carried along by the currents of history – we can shape them with moral conviction, unyielding courage and iron will.”the first woman elected to lead a major western state, lady thatcher, as she became after the longest premiership since 1827, served 11 unbroken years at no 10 downing street.thatcher, who was 87, had been in declining health for some years, suffering from dementia. after a series of mini-strokes in 2002, thatcher withdrew from public life, no longer able to make the kind of waspish pronouncements that had been her forte in office – and beyond.her death was greeted with tributes from across the political spectrum.as labour sources announced the party would suspend campaigning in local elections as a mark of respect, its leader, ed miliband, said: “she will be remembered as a unique figure. she reshaped the politics of a whole generation. she was britain’s first woman prime minister. she moved the centre ground of british politics and was a huge figure on the world stage. the labour party disagreed with much of what she did and she will always remain a controversial figure. but we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength.”the deputy prime minister, nick clegg, said: “margaret thatcher was one of the defining figures in modern british politics. whatever side of the political debate you stand on, no one can deny that as prime minister she left a unique and lasting imprint on the country she served.”describing her as a political phenomenon, the former tory prime minister sir john major said: “her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.”the “iron lady” proved a significant cold war ally of the us president ronald reagan in the final showdown with the soviet union, which broke up under reformist pressures led by mikhail gorbachev, a kremlin leader with whom thatcher famously declared she could “do business”. as a result, many ordinary voters in ex-soviet bloc states saw her as a bold champion of their liberty, a view widely shared across the spectrum of mainstream us opinion – though not at home or among key eu partners.thatcher was an unremarkable mid-ranking conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975. within a decade, she had become known around the world – both admired and detested – for her pro-market domestic reforms and her implacable attitudes in foreign policy, including her long-running battle with the ira, which almost managed to murder her when it placed a bomb in the grand hotel, brighton, in 1984.at home, the emerging doctrine of thatcherism meant denationalization of state-owned industry – the new word “privatization” came into widespread use in many countries – and defeat of militant trade unionists, notably the national union of miners, whose year-long strike (1984– 85) was bitter and traumatic.boosted by the newly arrived revenues from britain’s north sea oil fields, thatcher had room to manoeuvre and change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies – including moderate members of her own party.but she also deployed her notorious “handbaggings”, or verbal attacks, in the european union to obtain a british rebate – “my money” as she called it. she was less successful in fending off the centralizing ambitions of the “belgian empire”, her description of the european commission, especially in the years when it was headed by the french socialist jacques delors.her allies in the tabloid press egged her on. and, as the british economy recovered from the severe recession that her monetarist medicine had inflicted on it – to tame the unions and cure inflation – she briefly seemed invincible.but untrammelled power, with the defeat or retirement of allies who had kept her in check, led to mistakes and growing unpopularity. when sir geoffrey howe, nominally her deputy, finally fell out with thatcher – chiefly over europe – his devastating resignation speech triggered a leadership challenge. thatcher made way for john major rather than risk losing to him in a ballot.in retirement, she wrote highly successful memoirs in two volumes and campaigned energetically on behalf of the thatcher foundation, which sought to promote her values around the world.
advanced	jmw turner, one of britain’s greatest painters, is to be the face of the new £20 note, following a nationwide vote.it will be the first time an artist has appeared on a british banknote, after the governor of the bank of england, mark carney, asked the public to nominate a deceased cultural figure they felt deserved the high honour.turner, renowned for his dramatic seascapes, beat off competition from 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, film-makers and actors put forward by 30,000 members of the public.the list included alfred hitchcock, alexander mcqueen, derek jarman, laura ashley, william morris and vanessa bell, which was then narrowed down by a panel of artists, critics and historians to a final choice of five.the final five – barbara hepworth, charlie chaplin, josiah wedgwood, william hogarth and turner – were selected on the basis of their “unquestioned” contribution to both the visual arts and british society as a whole, as well as their enduring influence.fittingly, the announcement of the new banknote was made at the turner contemporary gallery in margate, which stands on the former site of mrs booth’s lodging house, where turner would always stay when he visited. the announcement was made jointly by carney and the artist tracey emin, who grew up in the town.carney said it had been “so important to get this right and have a proper process that involved the public,” adding that, far from banknotes being purely a practical necessity, “if done properly, they can be a piece of art in everyone’s pocket”.“money is memory for a country and its people,” said the bank of england governor. “banknotes of the bank of england are a celebration of the uk’s heritage, a salute to its culture, a testament to its great achievements, including those of its most notable citizens. in short, money has not just economic value, it has cultural value as well.“the fact that we will have turner on the £20 note shows now that the british people are a nation of people who appreciate creativity and appreciate the arts,” said emin.the note will feature turner’s 1799 self-portrait, which currently hangs in tate britain, as well as one of his most recognizable works, the fighting temeraire, a tribute to the ship that played a distinguished role in nelson’s victory at the battle of trafalgar in 1805.emblazoned on the note will also be a quote from the artist – “light is therefore colour” – as well as his signature, taken from his will, in which he bequeathed many of his works to the nation.the new £20 note, which replaces the one featuring social philosopher and economic theorist adam smith, will enter circulation by 2020. this is the first time the public have been given a say over whose face appears on a british banknote.carney overhauled the process in 2013, following a high-profile campaign to ensure that women, apart from the queen, remained on banknotes, after the bank decided to phase out the elizabeth fry £5 note.historical figures were first introduced onto banknotes in 1970. turner joins winston churchill and jane austen as the significant figures who will feature on the new polymer notes – a plastic-type material that the new notes will all be made from – churchill on the £5 and austen on the £10 note. following in the footsteps of florence nightingale and elizabeth fry, the pride and prejudice author is only the third woman to be the face of british currency.turner was born in 1775 in london, the son of a barber, and he entered the royal academy schools at the age of 14. it was 1786, when he was sent to margate, that his love affair with painting and drawing the north-east kent coast began. he would return to that coast throughout his life and it was where he painted some of his most dramatic oils and watercolours, describing its skies as “the loveliest in all europe”.turner was a particularly prolific artist, producing more than 550 oil paintings and 2,000 watercolours over his lifetime. his life was also the subject of a film, in 2014, by mike leigh, with timothy spall taking on the role of the complex artist.victoria pomery, the director of turner contemporary, said: “the decision to celebrate jmw turner, one of the greatest technical pioneers in the history of british art, is extraordinary, not least because it has proven by a public vote that turner is the nation’s favourite artist. brilliantly, it is an official acknowledgment of the immense historical value of the visual arts to the uk.“but it is also a stark reminder that we must place increasing value on our future as a nation of creative minds. we must invest to support the next great artists and innovators.”
