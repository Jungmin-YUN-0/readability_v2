intermediate	women have traditionally played a minor role in professional football, but this may be changing. france has just appointed its first female professional team manager. it did not matter that it was a second-division club. it did not matter if it was, as some people suggested, just a publicity stunt for a minor team, clermont foot 63, which is currently 14th out of the 20 teams in its league.what mattered was that helena costa had been given the top job – an act that saw her make football history by becoming the first female manager to be appointed in the highest two divisions of any professional european league. “as a woman, it’s made me happy,” véronique soulier, president of the club’s supporters’ association, told journalists. “when i first heard the news, i was rather surprised, but, once that passed, we were pretty unanimous that it’s good news. we all agree that a woman at the head of a group of men is no bad thing.”the new manager of clermont foot 63, whose average home crowd is around 3,800, was born in alhandra, portugal and graduated with a master’s degree in sports science. she is also a uefalicensed coach. she previously coached benfica’s male youth teams, the qatar women’s team and, more recently, the iranian women’s national side, which she left in september 2013.costa, 36, was appointed on a two-year contract by the president of clermont foot 63, claude michy, who is a champion at grabbing the headlines for his club. in 2013, he announced the team had signed messi. they had. not the argentinian and fc barcelona record-breaking striker lionel messi, but junior messi enguene, a 20-year-old midfielder from cameroon. france’s women’s minister, najat vallaud- belkacem, tweeted: “bravo to clermont foot for understanding that giving women a place is the future of professional football.”carolina morace, an italian who was the only previous woman coach of a men’s professional team, said: “i don’t know helena, but if she has been hired by a team then it means that she knows how to do her job. i hope that, one day, this can become normal.” morace was an outstanding player in the women’s game, playing for italy in 153 internationals. in 1999, she was named as the coach of the men’s team viterbese. but, after only two games, she resigned from the job because of a disagreement with the club’s proprietor. she added: “for the time being, i see too many men, even in the women’s game, who are working despite not having the same expertise as women, who, by contrast, are not working.”raymond domenech, former manager of the french national team, said: “women know how to play football and how to manage and are good at doing it. why shouldn’t they manage men’s teams? the opposite happens and doesn’t cause any problems. it’s a natural choice and reflects our society in which women are equal to men. i say well done to president michy. i told myself that, if i took charge of a club again, i’d hire a woman as my number two. he beat me to it.”a statement on clermont foot 63’s website said costa’s appointment would allow the club to enter “a new era”. on the club supporters’ website, reaction to costa’s appointment was a mix of surprise and a certain cynicism. “in my opinion, it’s just a publicity stunt to get people talking about the club and she won’t last the season. i find it hard to believe she’ll be able to get the players’ respect, above all when she’s the same age as the oldest,” wrote one fan. “her cv isn’t bad, but now the question is: will she be good enough?” added another. a third wrote: “i wish her welcome and success but i think it’ll be hard for her to make her mark as a woman in such a macho business.”but soulier was hopeful: “hopefully, with the new manager, the club can find the motivation they’re lacking at the moment,” she said. “the boys in the team can be difficult to manage. with a woman in charge, maybe they’ll be less demanding.”if costa’s reputation is anything to go by, she will be the one making the demands. after doing work experience at chelsea during her compatriot josé mourinho’s first time as manager of the club between 2004 and 2007, she was described as “mourinho in a skirt”. costa quickly dismissed the description. “like mourinho, i always want to win. as far as that’s concerned, yes, i’m happy to be compared with him,” she said.nannan
intermediate	when the taliban sent a gunman to shoot malala yousafzai in october 2012 as she rode home on a bus after school, they knew what they wanted: to silence the teenager and kill off her campaign for girls’ education.nine months and countless surgical operations later, she stood up at the united nations on her 16th birthday on friday to give a defiant reply. “they thought that the bullet would silence us. but they failed,” she said.it was an unusual 16th birthday. instead of blowing out candles on a cake, malala sat in one of the main council chambers at the united nations in the central seat usually reserved for world leaders.she listened quietly as ban ki-moon, the un secretary-general, described her as “our hero, our champion”; and as the former british prime minister and now un education envoy, gordon brown, said what he called “the words the taliban never wanted her to hear: happy 16th birthday, malala”.the event, named malala day, was the culmination of an extraordinary four years for the girl from mingora in pakistan. she was thrust into the public glare after she wrote a blog for the bbc urdu service describing her experiences of struggling to get an education under the rising power of taliban militants.by 11, she was showing exceptional determination, calling personally on the us special representative to pakistan, richard holbrooke, to use his influence against the taliban’s efforts to stop education for girls. by 14, she was on the radar of archbishop desmond tutu, who suggested her for the international children’s peace prize, and, by 15, she became the youngest nobel peace prize nominee in history.but all this global attention came at a price. death threats followed, and, on 9 october 2012, following a meeting of pakistani taliban leaders, the gunman was sent to silence her.multiple operations in pakistan and the uk followed the attack on the bus, including the fitting of a titanium plate on her left forehead and a cochlear implant to restore her hearing. she now lives with her family in birmingham and does what the taliban tried to stop her doing: she goes to school every day. “i am not against anyone,” she said in the un chamber, having taken this day out from the classroom. “neither am i here to speak in terms of personal revenge against the taliban or any other terrorist group.”malala responded to the violence of the taliban with words against bullets. “i do not even hate the talib who shot me. even if there was a gun in my hand and he stood in front of me, i would not shoot him.”she spoke confidently, with only an injured eye and a slightly drooping left side of her face to hint at such fresh traumas. there was one other allusion to the horror of her past: she wore a white shawl belonging to a woman who was also targeted by extremists but who, unlike malala, did not survive: benazir bhutto, the former prime minister of pakistan.“the extremists are afraid of books and pens,” the teenager continued. “the power of education frightens them. they are afraid of women. the power of the voice of women frightens them.”she talked about the attack in june on a hospital in quetta, capital of baluchistan, and killings of female teachers in khyber pakhtunkhwa. “that is why they are blasting schools every day – because they were and they are afraid of change, afraid of the equality that we will bring to our society.”and she gave her own opposing interpretation of islam to the taliban’s. “they think that god is a tiny, little conservative being who would send girls to hell just because they go to school. the terrorists are misusing the name of islam and pashtun society for their own personal benefits. islam is a religion of peace, humanity and brotherhood. islam says that it is not only each child’s right to get education but their duty and responsibility.”such ability to say what normally remains unsaid – to give voice to young people who are normally silenced – has created its own response. the “stand with malala” petition, demanding education for the 57 million children around the world who do not go to school, has attracted more than four million signatures – more than a million were added after malala’s speech.at the start of her speech, malala said: “i don’t know where to begin my speech. i don’t know what people are expecting me to say.” she did not need to worry.
intermediate	scientists have connected the brains of two animals and allowed them to share sensory information. it is a major step towards what the researchers call the world’s first “organic computer”.the us team fitted two rats with devices called brain-to-brain interfaces that let the animals collaborate on simple tasks to earn rewards, such as a drink of water. in one important demonstration of the technology, the scientists used the internet to connect the brains of two rats separated by thousands of miles – one in north carolina, usa, and the other in natal, brazil.the researchers were led by miguel nicolelis, a pioneer of devices that allow paralyzed people to control computers and robotic arms with their thoughts. they say their latest work could make it possible for multiple brains to be connected to share information. “these experiments showed that we have established a sophisticated, direct communication connection between brains,” nicolelis said. “basically, we are creating what i call an organic computer.”the scientists first demonstrated that rats can share, and act on, each other’s sensory information by electrically connecting their brains via tiny grids of electrodes that reach the part of the brain that processes movement.the rats were taught to press a lever when a light went on above it. when they did the task correctly, they got a drink of water. to test the animals’ ability to share brain information, they put the rats in two separate compartments. only one compartment had a light above the lever. when the rat pressed the lever, an electronic version of its brain activity was sent directly to the other rat’s brain. in tests, the second rat responded correctly to the imported brain signals and pressed the lever 70% of the time.incredibly, the communication between the rats was two-way. if the receiving rat failed at the task, the first rat did not get the reward of a drink, and appeared to change its behaviour to make the task easier for its partner. in further experiments, the rats collaborated on a task that required them to tell the difference between narrow and wide openings using their whiskers.in the final test, the scientists connected rats on different continents and used the internet to send their brain activity back and forth. “even though the animals were on different continents, they could still communicate,” said miguel pais-vieira, the first author of the study. “this tells us that we could create a workable network of animal brains distributed in many different locations.”nicolelis said the team is now working on ways to connect several animals’ brains at once to solve more complex tasks. “we cannot even predict what might happen when animals begin interacting as part of a ‘brain-net’,” he said. “in theory, you could imagine that a combination of brains could find solutions that individual brains cannot achieve by themselves.”anders sandberg, who studies the ethics of neurotechnologies at oxford university, said the work was “very important” in helping to understand how brains encode information. but the potential future uses of the technology are much wider, said sandberg. “the main reason we are running the planet is that we are amazingly good at communicating and coordinating. without that, although we are very smart animals, we would not dominate the planet.”“i don’t think there’s any risk of supersmart rats from this,” he added. “there’s a big difference between sharing sensory information and being able to plan. i’m not worried about an invasion by smart rats.”very little is known about how people encode thoughts and how they might be sent to another person’s brain – so that will not happen any time soon. and much of what is in our minds is a “draft”, as sandberg calls it, of what we might do. “often, we don’t want to reveal those drafts, because that would be embarrassing and confusing. and we change a lot of those drafts before we act. most of the time i think we’d be very thankful not to be in someone else’s head.”
intermediate	during a momentous day at liverpool cathedral for the families of the 96 people who died so needlessly at sheffield wednesday’s hillsborough football ground, you could hear one phrase again and again: the truth. these were the words used in a headline in the sun newspaper. we now know that the story in the newspaper was given to the paper by the south yorkshire police to move the blame for the disaster onto the innocent victims.margaret aspinall’s son james, then 18, died at the match between liverpool and nottingham forest. she said the families had had to fight for 23 years for the truth. aspinall, chairperson of the hillsborough family support group, said that the families’ loss would never go away, but she was “delighted” that the prime minister gave a “profound” apology for hillsborough.an independent panel studied 450,000 documents created by the police, sheffield wednesday and all other bodies responsible. then it produced a 395-page report, criticizing official mistakes and highlighting the fact that the victims and other fans were not responsible. some of the causes of the disaster have been exposed before but the depth of the cover-up was still shocking, in particular the police campaign to falsely blame the supporters.the panel found that the south yorkshire police, led by the chief constable, peter wright, told their story that drunken supporters or those without tickets had caused the disaster. the victims’ blood was tested for alcohol levels. this was “an exceptional decision”, the panel said, and it found “no rationale” for it. when victims had alcohol in their blood, the police then checked to find if they had criminal records. the report found there was “no evidence … to prove the serious allegations of exceptional levels of drunkenness, ticketlessness or violence among liverpool fans”.the report found that wright met his police federation in a sheffield restaurant to prepare “a defence” and “a rock-solid story”. the meeting was held just four days after the disaster. it was the day that the sun newspaper published its headline “the truth” over lies told to it by four senior south yorkshire police officers.the panel found that officers’ statements were changed to delete criticism of the police and emphasize misbehaviour by supporters. the panel found that 116 of 164 statements were changed to remove or change negative comments about south yorkshire police. the police had claimed they changed statements only to remove “opinion”, but the panel had no doubt they did more than that. “it was done to remove criticism of the police,” the report said.this propaganda did not convince the original inquiry. it found in august 1989 that the police stories of fan drunkenness and misbehaviour were false, and criticized the police for making the claims. it revealed that sheffield wednesday’s football ground was unsafe, that the football association had chosen it as the stadium for the match without even checking if it had a valid safety certificate (it did not).but it was the mismanagement of the crowd by the police, led by an inexperienced chief superintendent david duckenfield, that was “the main cause” of the disaster. the police lost control outside the ground, where 24,000 liverpool fans had to go through just 23 turnstiles, so duckenfield ordered a large exit gate to be opened and a large number of people to be allowed in. his mistake, according to the inquiry, was the failure to close the tunnel that led to the central section behind the goal, which was already overcrowded.but the police still repeated their claims at the inquest. the coroner decided not to take evidence of what happened after 3.15pm on the day of the disaster, so the chaotic emergency response was not examined. the panel found that 41 of the 96 who died could possibly have been saved if the police and ambulance service had done their jobs properly.following the panel’s report, the attorney general will now decide whether to have a new inquest. there may be prosecutions too, after all these years, of sheffield wednesday, south yorkshire police and sheffield city council, which failed in its duty to oversee safety of the football ground. trevor hicks, president of the hillsborough family support group, whose two teenage daughters died in the disaster, said: “the truth is out today. tomorrow is for justice.”nannannannan
intermediate	hundreds of young cubans are using the first known free, open-access internet service in the communist island nation. it has been made possible by one of cuba’s most famous artists. a small cultural centre in the capital city, havana, has suddenly become a rare source of free wi-fi. the internationally known cuban artist kcho is providing the service. perhaps more surprisingly, the service has been approved by the state-owned telecommunications company, etecsa.people say the service is very slow, especially when the centre gets crowded. but, in a country where only about 5% of the population has unrestricted access to the internet, a facility that is both free of charge and free of restrictions is being welcomed.the chance to click on international news websites, communicate with friends and family overseas and use sites like facebook and twitter has created a lot of excitement. “i come as often as i can,” said adonis ortiz, 20, while video-chatting with his father, who lives in the us and whom he has not seen in nine years.as diplomatic and trade relations between the us and cuba improve, american tech giants such as google and apple are expected to enter the cuban market as soon as they are permitted. in the meantime, cuba has installed a high-speed fibre-optic cable under the sea from venezuela and internet users have some access to chinese equipment.another estimate, that a quarter of cubans have access to the internet – still one of the lowest rates in the western hemisphere – in fact measures residents who use a restricted domestic intranet that only features certain websites and has limited email.kcho has offered the public admission to his own personal internet connection. but this is not the action of a counter-revolutionary or free-market rebel. kcho was probably chosen as the acceptable face of a government recognizing the inevitable attractions of the internet.kcho, who has close ties to the cuban government, announced that his actions had been approved by the ministry of culture. the artist said he wanted to encourage cubans to familiarize themselves with the internet. “it’s only possible if you are determined and if you absorb the costs,” kcho told the associated press. “it is expensive but the benefit is tremendous. i have something that is great and powerful. i can share it and i am doing so.”kcho’s real name is alexis leiva machado. he became famous internationally for his painting, sculpture and drawings after winning the grand prize at a prominent art biennial in south korea. he is currently preparing for the havana biennial in may. born on one of cuba’s islands, he is known for contemporary art with rustic, seaside and patriotic themes and imagery.in the centre’s courtyard, tech-savvy young people lounge throughout the day or just sit outside when it’s crowded, tapping away on laptops and tablets or glued to their smartphones.cuba has some of the lowest connectivity rates on the planet, with dial-up accounts closely restricted and at-home broadband almost unheard of except in the case of foreigners – they pay hundreds of dollars a month for the service in a country where the average salary is between $17 and $20 a month. kcho is believed to be paying $900 a month to provide the free wi-fi.since 2013, cuban authorities have opened hundreds of internet salons, where an hour online costs $4.50, at speeds far lower than those at kcho’s studio of around 2mbps. a 2014 report found average internet connectivity speeds to be around 10.5mbps in the us and 23.6mbps in world-leading south korea. globally, the average was about 3.9mbps.with dozens of users at one time, the signal strength of kcho’s wi-fi is diluted. one user said he sometimes visits in the middle of the night, when nobody else is around, and finds it to be unbelievably fast.
intermediate	according to a new scientific study, temperature rises caused by uncontrolled global warming could be at the high end of current estimates. the scientist who led the research said that, unless emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced, the planet will heat up by a minimum of 4c by 2100. this is twice the level the worldõs governments consider to be dangerous.the research indicates that fewer clouds form as the planet warms, which means less sunlight is reflected back into space. this forces temperatures up even higher. the way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change.professor steven sherwood, at the university of new south wales in australia, who led the new work, said that the study broke new ground in two ways. first, it identified what controls the cloud changes and, second, it rejected the lowest estimates of future global warming and favoured the higher and more damaging estimates.ò4c would be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous,ó sherwood said. òfor example, it would make life difficult, if not impossible, in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the greenland ice sheet and some of the antarctic ice sheetó, with sea levels rising by many metres as a result.the research reduces the uncertainty about how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions, according to scientists commenting on the study, published in the journal nature. experts at japanõs national institute for environmental studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was òconvincingó and agreed that this indicated future climate change would be greater than expected.scientists measure the sensitivity of the earthõs climate to greenhouse gases by estimating the temperature rise that would be caused by a doubling of co2 in the atmosphere compared with pre-industrial levels ð which is likely to happen within 50 years. for two decades, those estimates have run from 1.5c to 5c:  wide range. the new research narrowed that range down to between 3c and 5c, by closely examining the biggest cause of uncertainty: clouds.computer climate models are the only tool researchers have to predict future temperatures and it was important to make sure that the way clouds are formed was represented accurately in those models. when water evaporates from the oceans, the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight; or, it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds. in reality, both processes happen and climate models that included the second possibility predicted significantly higher future temperatures than models that only included the nine-mile-high clouds.òclimate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the first to admit they are not perfect,ó said sherwood. òbut what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by the models that predict less warming, not those that predict more.ó he added: òsceptics may also point to the ôhiatusõ of temperatures since the end of the 20th century, but there is increasing evidence that this hiatus is not seen in other measures of the climate system and is almost certainly temporary.óglobal average air temperatures have increased quite slowly since a high point in 1998, which was caused by the ocean phenomenon el nin_o. but, observations show that heat is continuing to be trapped in increasing amounts by greenhouse gases, with over 90% disappearing into the oceans. furthermore, a study in november 2013 suggested the òpauseó may be mainly an illusion ð a result of the lack of temperature readings from polar regions, where warming is greatest.sherwood accepts his teamõs work on the role of clouds cannot definitely rule out that future temperature rises will be at the lower end of projections. but, for that to be the case, there would need to be some major missing ingredient for which there is currently no evidence. he added that a 4c rise in global average temperatures would have a serious impact on the world and the economies of many countries if emissions were not reduced.
intermediate	organic food has more of the antioxidants linked to better health than regular food, and lower levels of toxic metals and pesticides, according to the most comprehensive scienti c analysis so far. the international team behind the work suggests that switching to organic fruit and vegetables could give the same bene ts as adding one or two portions of the recommended ô ve a dayõ fruit and vegetables.the team, led by professor carlo leifert, concludes that there are òstatistically signi cantó differences, with a range of antioxidants being òsubstantially higheró ð between 19% and 69% ð in organic food. it is the  rst study to demonstrate clear differences between organic and conventional fruits, vegetables and cereals.the researchers say the increased levels of antioxidants are equivalent to òone to two of the  ve portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be signi cant in terms of human nutritionó.the  ndings will add to the controversy over organic food and whether it is better for people. tom sanders, a professor of nutrition at kingõs college london, said the research did show some differences. òbut the question is are they within natural variation? and are they nutritionally relevant? i am not convinced.ó he added, òleifert has had a lot of disagreements with a lot of people.ó he also said that research showed organic cereals have less protein than conventional crops.the results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 studies from around the world ð more than ever before ð which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit, vegetables and cereals. òthe important thing about this research is that it shatters the myth that how we farm does not affect the quality of the food we eat,ó said helen browning, chief executive of the soil association, which campaigns for organic farming.leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants òhave previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancersó. the researchers also found much higher levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, in conventional crops. pesticide residues were found on conventional crops four times more often than on organic food.the research is certain to be criticized: the inclusion of so many studies in the analysis could mean poor-quality work makes the results unreliable. also, the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in conventional produce were still far below recommended limits. but, the researchers say cadmium accumulates over time in the body and that some people may wish to avoid this, and that pesticide limits are set individually, not for the cocktail of chemicals used on crops.a further criticism of the research is that the differences seen may result from different climates, soil types and crop varieties, and not from organic farming. the greatest criticism, however, will be over the suggestions of possible health bene ts. the most recent major analysis, which included 223 studies in 2012, found little evidence. òthe published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are signi cantly more nutritious than conventional foods,ó it found.this was also the conclusion of earlier, smaller studies published in 2009 in a scienti c journal and by the uk food standards agency. the 2012 study did note that eating organic food might help people avoid pesticide residues. sanders said he was not persuaded by the new work. òyou are not going to be healthier if you eat organic food,ó he said. òwhat is most important is what you eat, not whether itõs organic or conventional. itõs whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all.óopinion polls show healthy eating (55%) and avoiding chemical residues (53%) are key reasons given by shoppers for buying organic produce. but, many also say care for the environment (44%) and animal welfare (31%) are important, and also taste (35%). browning said: òthis research con rms what people think about organic food. in other countries, there have, for a long time, been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming. we hope these  ndings will bring the uk into line with the rest of europe.ónan
intermediate	loneliness has finally become a hot topic. the office for national statistics has found britain to be the loneliest place in europe. british people are less likely to have strong friendships or know their neighbours than people anywhere else in the european union. and research at the university of chicago has found that loneliness is twice as bad for older people’s health as obesity and almost as great a cause of death as poverty.this is shocking but such studies do not examine the loneliness epidemic among younger adults. in 2010, the mental health foundation found that loneliness was a greater concern among young people than among the elderly. the 18- to 34-year-olds surveyed were more likely to feel lonely often, to worry about feeling alone and to feel depressed because of loneliness than the over-55s.“loneliness is a recognized problem among the elderly and there are day centres and charities to help them,” says sam challis, of the mental health charity mind, “but, when young people reach 21, they’re too old for youth services.” this is problematic because of the close relationship between loneliness and mental health – it is linked to increased stress, depression, paranoia, anxiety, addiction and it is a known cause of suicide.but what can young people do to prevent loneliness? one researcher at the oxford internet institute points out that social media and the internet can be both a good thing and a problem. they are beneficial when they enable us to communicate with distant loved ones but not when they replace face-to-face contact. “people present an idealized version of themselves online and we expect to have social lives like those we see in the media,” says challis. comparing the perfect lives of our friends with our own lives can lead us to withdraw socially.meditation techniques and apps such as headspace are trendy solutions frequently recommended for a range of mental health problems, but they’re not necessarily helpful for loneliness, as they actively encourage us to be alone with our thoughts. “it is better to address the causes of your loneliness first – what’s stopping you going out and seeing people?” says challis.indeed, a study of social media at the university of michigan in 2013 found that using technology to help you meet new people can be beneficial. and, if you are unable to go out for some reason, the internet can help you. for example, mumsnet, an online network for parents, can help you feel less alone when bringing up young children.helplines can also reduce loneliness, at least in the short term. one in four men who call the emotional support charity samaritans mention loneliness or isolation and get connected is a free confidential helpline for young people, where they can get help with emotional and mental health problems often linked to loneliness. there are also support services on websites such as mind’s that can remind you you’re not alone.at work, it can be beneficial to tell your employer how you’re feeling. john binns advises businesses on mental health and well-being. he was admitted to hospital for stress-related depression in 2007 and took two months off work. he felt as if there was no one to talk to and wasn’t close enough to colleagues for them to notice the changes in his behaviour. more openness with his employer and colleagues made his return to work easier. office chit-chat may seem like a waste of time but it helps to protect us from the emotional and psychological effects of work strain.“we treat the networks we have as incidental but they’re fundamental to our well-being,” says nicky forsythe, a psychotherapist and the founder of talk for health, an organization that trains people to give and receive support in groups. “the most important thing is to have a regular time and place to reflect on your life and to have an empathetic listener.”if we believe recent research, loneliness is killing the elderly and, with an ageing population, we should aim to reduce our isolation before it is too late. “getting older doesn’t have to mean getting lonelier,” says ruth sutherland, the chief executive of the relationship counselling service relate. “but it is very important to lay the foundations to good-quality relationships earlier in life.”nannan
intermediate	vienna is the worldõs best city to live in, baghdad is the worst and london, paris and new york do not even enter the top 35, according to international research into quality of life.german-speaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th mercer quality of life study, with vienna joined by zurich, munich, dusseldorf and frankfurt in the top seven.paris has dropped down the table ð it has fallen ten places to 37th, just ahead of london at 39th, mostly because of the terrorist attacks on the city.the study examined social and economic conditions, health, education, housing and the environment. it is used by big companies to decide where they should open of ces and factories and how much they should pay staff.helena hartlauer, 32, from vienna, said she was not surprised at her cityõs top position. the cityõs social democratic government has a long tradition of investing money in high-quality social housing, which makes vienna less expensive than other major cities.òi live in a 100sq-metre apartment in a good area about 20 minutesõ walk from the city centre. but my rent is just û800 (£625) a month.ó a similar apartment in london would cost over £2,000 and even more in new york, ranked 44th in the table.us cities perform relatively badly in the study, mostly because of issues around personal safety and crime. the highest ranking city in the us is san francisco, at 28th; boston is 34th. canadian cities, led by vancouver, do much better than their us rivals in the table.òyou donõt realize how safe vienna is until you go abroad,ó said hartlauer. òwe also have terri c public transport, with the underground working 24 hours at weekends and it only costs û1 per trip.óvienna bene ted enormously from the fall of the berlin wall, becoming the gateway to eastern european countries that often have historic connections to the former austro-hungarian empire.òour big usp (unique selling point) is our geographical location,ó said martin eichtinger, austrian ambassador to london, who lived in vienna for 20 years. òthe fall of the berlin wall helped make vienna a hub for companies wanting to do business in central europe.óaccording to the world bank, austria has one of the highest  gures for gdp (gross domestic product) per person in the world, just behind the us and ahead of germany and britain, although below neighbouring switzerland.mercer says zurich in switzerland has the worldõs second highest quality of life but the viennese say their city is far more fun. òthere are more students in vienna than any other german-speaking city,ó said hartlauer. òitõs a very fast growing, young and lively city,ó she added.vienna has long been overlooked by british weekend city break tourists, who instead go to barcelona or berlin and tend to think of austria as somewhere for skiing, lakes and mountains.but, after an increase in budget  ights from british cities such as manchester and edinburgh, vienna is becoming a more popular destination. in 2015, there were 588,000 british visitors to vienna, 18% more than the year before.òvienna has ranked top in the last seven surveys,ó said mercer. òit scores highly in a number of categories; it provides a safe and stable environment to live in, a high standard of public transport and good recreational facilities.ólondon has never been in the quality-of-life top ten, says mercer, damaged by its poor scores for air pollution, traf c congestion and climate. after london, edinburgh is the next-ranking british city, in 46th place.paris has suffered the biggest fall in the most recent rankings. òparis has remained stable for several years but has, this year, dropped ten places,ó said mercer. òthe drop was mostly due to the terrorist attacks in 2015 because safety is a very important factor in the survey.óauckland in new zealand was the highest ranking english-speaking city in the survey, in third place, followed by vancouver in  fth. australian cities also do well in the survey, with sydney 10th and melbourne 15th.war and political unrest are behind all the worst- ranked cities in the world. surprisingly, damascus is named as only the seventh worst, ranked better than baghdad, bangui in central african republic, sanaõa in yemen, port-au-prince in haiti, khartoum in sudan and nõdjamena in chad.nannan
intermediate	a lonely old man living on the moon is the unusual focus of john lewis’s 2015 christmas advert.there is increasing hype around john lewis’s seasonal ad, which has come to mark the beginning of the christmas shopping season for many. the department store will aim to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for age uk. it will also encourage staff and customers to join up with their local branch of the charity to care for elderly people who might be alone over the holiday.the department store has spent £7m on a campaign that ranges from the tv ad to a smartphone game and merchandise, including glow-in-the-dark pyjamas, as well as making areas that look like the surface of the moon in 11 of their stores.after two years of successful ads with cuddly animals – a bear and hare, then a penguin – this time, the store is tugging at the heartstrings with a story of a young girl, lily, who spots an old man living in a shack on the moon through her telescope. the determined child tries sending him a letter and firing a note via bow and arrow, before floating him a present of a telescope tied to balloons, which finally allows them to make contact.the ad’s message is: “show someone they’re loved this christmas”, which echoes age uk’s own campaign: “no one should have no one at christmas”. profits from three products – a mug, gift tag and card – will go to the charity.rachel swift, head of marketing at john lewis, said that people talk about the charity at this time of year and the ad makes you think about someone who lives on your street that might not see anybody.the campaign features the oasis track half the world away reinterpreted by norwegian artist aurora.the ad cost £1m to make. the moon scenes were shot at the warner bros studios, where the harry potter films were made, and the specially built set was created by one of the team behind the latest star wars film, the force awakens.as in the last few years, john lewis has drummed up interest in their most recent ad with a teaser campaign on tv and social media using the hashtag #onthemoon. a full moon will fall on christmas day 2015 – a complete coincidence, according to swift.in 2014, the retailer also spent £7m on a campaign with a realistic animated penguin and a young boy playing together to the tune of john lennon’s real love, sung by british singer-songwriter tom odell. it had drummed up 22m views on youtube by the first week of january – more than the 16.6m views of sainsbury’s ad with first world war soldiers sharing a bar of chocolate, the uk’s second most popular ad of 2014.swift said that, despite the hype, john lewis had kept the same strategy for the last five years. “it’s all about thoughtful gifting and going the extra mile for someone you love at christmas,” she said. “we don’t go into it thinking, ‘this is going to be huge,’ just getting something right for the brand at this time of year and something we hope customers really love.”sarah vizard, news editor of trade journal marketing week, said john lewis appeared to have simplified efforts this time, with a lower-key presence in stores despite a growing number of competitors. “there are definitely a lot more brands doing christmas ads this year but i think a lot of those brands who tried to compete with john lewis by doing something emotional and creative have gone back to what you can buy in store,” she said. “john lewis still does the emotional piece the best. this campaign is another great way of communicating that in a way that customers can relate to. i think people will think it is really cute.”nannannannan
elementary	passing clouds one of the good things about flying is seeing clouds very close. they seem to be light, but they carry a lot of water – around 500 tonnes in a small cloud. and water is heavier than air. so why don’t clouds fall out of the sky like rain? they do, but they take a very long time. an average cloud would take a year to fall one metre.on cloud nine most of us are happy to call clouds “fluffy ones” or “nasty black ones”, but there are more than 50 cloud types. the 50 cloud types fit into nine categories. cloud nine is the very big cumulonimbus, so to be “on cloud nine” means that you are on top of the world or very, very happy.around the rainbow the best place to see a rainbow is from a plane. rainbows are made when sunlight hits raindrops. we see a bow because the earth is in the way, but, from a plane, a rainbow is a complete circle.mr blue sky sunlight is white. it includes all the colours of the spectrum. as it passes through air, some of the light is scattered. blue light scatters more than other colours, so the blue looks like it comes from the sky.there’s life out there we usually only see clouds and other planes from a flying aircraft’s window, but the air is full of bacteria – 1,800 different types of bacteria.turbulence terror even someone who flies all the time can feel sick because of turbulence. the good news is that no modern airliner has ever crashed because of these sudden and violent movements of air. people have been hurt when they are not strapped in or falling luggage may hit them – but the plane is not going to fall out of the sky.you can’t cure jet lag the world is divided into time zones. when you take a long flight, the difference between local time and your body’s time causes jet lag. but jet lag can be reduced if you keep food bland for 24 hours before travel, drink a lot and live on your destination time from the moment you get on the aircraft.supersonic 747s many of us have travelled faster than sound. there are many jet streams in the air around the earth, especially on the journey from the us to europe. a jet stream can move as fast as 250 miles per hour. if an airliner flying at 550mph enters a jet stream, the result can be that the plane flies at 800mph. that’s faster than the speed of sound.flying through time flying across time zones means that we travel through time. but this time travel is so small that crossing the atlantic every week for 40 years would only move you 1/1,000th of a second into the future.terrible tea don’t blame the cabin attendant if your tea isn’t great. water should be just under 100°c when you pour it on to tea leaves – but that isn’t possible on a plane. it’s impossible to get water hotter than 90°c during flight – so choose coffee.i can’t hear my food people often say that airline food is bland and without taste. but some of the problem may not be bad food. a plane is a noisy place and food loses some of its taste when there are loud noises.needle in a haystack with modern technology, it seems strange that malaysian flight mh370 could disappear – but finding a missing aircraft is a needle-in-ahaystack problem. the plane knows where it is but it does not send this information anywhere. the problem is not technology – the problem is that there is no law that says that planes must send this information.volcanic fallout air travel can be cancelled by volcanic activity. ash melts in the heat of the engine, then solidifies on the rotors. it is very dangerous to ignore the volcanic ash.the wing myth for many years, we taught the wrong explanation for the way wings keep planes in the air. but now we know that a plane stays in the air because of newton’s third law of motion. the shape of the wing pushes air down. as the air is pushed down, the wing gets an equal and opposite push up, and this lifts the plane.nannannannan
elementary	a subway system has billions of inhabitants: the bacteria of swiss cheese and kimchi, plague and human skin. now, for the  rst time, scientists have started to study the bacteria in a cityõs subway ð and they have found many interesting results.dr christopher mason, a scientist at weill cornell medical college, led a team that tested the new york city subway system for 18 months. his team found meningitis at times square, a trace of anthrax on a train carriage and bacteria that cause plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown manhattan.the team said the  ndings of plague and anthrax are not serious. they said that there was only a very small trace of anthrax, that rats probably carried the plague and that no one has become ill with plague in new york for years.òthe results do not show that people in new york are at risk,ó the study says. in fact, most of the bacteria the team found are harmless to humans.some of the results were not a surprise. they showed that people òshould wash their handsó, mason said. he also said that they found many bacteria that are helpful, like the bacteria used for making cheese.all around the subway, there were bacteria from cheeses ð brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella found on new york pizza. the bacteria of swiss cheese were found in midtown manhattan and the  nancial district, and the bacteria used to make kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the  nancial district and bay ridge.bacteria that can cause illness and infections were very common. bacteria that cause diarrhoea and nausea, as well as e.coli, and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city. the scientists found bacteria that cause tetanus in soho and bacteria that cause dysentery at a station in the bronx and in harlem.mason and his team collected more than 1,000 samples from all of new yorkõs 466 open subway stations. they found 15,152 different species, nearly half of which were bacteria.the good news, they said, is that these bacteria are not spreading sickness or disease in new york and that the subway and city are as safe as everyone thought.òin fact,ó mason added, òiõve become much more confident riding the subway.ómany  ndings made sense: stations like grand central and times square, where there are more people, had more bacteria. the bronx, with its diverse neighbourhoods and stations, had the greatest diversity of bacteria; staten island, with just three stops, had the lowest diversity of bacteria.the researchers found sea and  sh bacteria at south ferry, a station that  ooded during hurricane sandy.the next steps, mason said, are studies of other cities, which have begun in paris, sa_o paolo and shanghai. they also want to do more studies of new york. he said he hoped the research would help health of cials to prevent and track diseases.nannannan
elementary	scientists have designed a mirror that sends heat into cold space. if you use the mirror, you donõt need to use air-conditioning units that keep buildings cool on earth.the scientists believe that the mirror could reduce by a lot the amount of energy we use to control air temperatures in of ces and shopping centres.around 15% of the energy used by buildings in the us goes on air conditioning. the researchers say that the mirror could mean that we no longer need air conditioning.scientists in stanford, california, found that a roof painted black was 60c hotter than the air temperature in sunlight. they found that aluminium was 40c hotter. but the mirror was 5c cooler than the air temperature.òif you cover large parts of the roof with this mirror, you can save a lot of power,ó said shanhui fan, an expert in the study of light at stanford university. he led the development of the mirror.buildings warm up in different ways. hot-water boilers and cooking areas release heat. in hot countries, warm air comes in through doors and windows. then, there is visible light and infrared radiation from the sun, which also heat up buildings.the stanford mirror re ects 97% of the visible light that falls on it. but, more importantly, it releases heat. when the mirror is warmed up, it releases heat at a speci c wavelength of infrared light that goes easily through the atmosphere and out into space.the mirror is made from several layers of very thin materials. these layers help the mirror to release heat. the mirror sends the heat as infrared light out to space.òthe mirror can use the cold darkness of the universe, even during the hottest hours of the day,ó the scientists say.shanhui fan says the mirrors costs between $20 and $70 per square metre. he says that a mirror on a three-storey building could save 100mwh of electricity per year.fanalsosaidthatthemirrorcouldcoolbuildings but it would not slow down global warming. but it would reduce the amount of electricity that businesses use. òiõm really excited by this,ó said marin solja__i__, a physicist at the massachusetts institute of technology. òyou could use the mirrors on buildings and spend much less money on air conditioning or maybe you wouldnõt need it at all. you could put the mirrors on top of shopping malls.ónannan
elementary	he was a normal millionaire. he had a gold and silver rolex watch and lots of expensive cars. he liked to buy modern art. this chinese businessman had many companies and a large villa in madrid. but, he had almost no money in the bank. this interested the spanish authorities.gao ping sold goods to 4,000 chinese markets in spain. but, authorities suspected he was not paying taxes on the clothes, furniture and other goods he was bringing in from china.when police went to his warehouses in 2012, they found lots of cash: €100, €200 and €500 notes. police took away around €12m, the most cash ever found by spanish police.police have been worried about €500 notes for a long time. small and easy to transport, they are the favourite banknotes of criminals. the sum of €1m in €500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag. the same amount in €50 notes would need a small suitcase.the uk stopped using the €500 note in 2010 because they were used “almost entirely by criminals”. in 2009, italy’s central bank said that mafia money launderers and terrorists used the notes. canada got rid of its $1,000 note in 2000 because the police advised them to.these days, we have electronic payment systems and contactless cards so people are asking why it is still necessary to have these banknotes. peter sands, the former head of standard chartered bank, said we should get rid of large notes, including the €500, the $100, the 1,000 swiss franc note and the £50. sands said it was time to get rid of high-value notes that make life easier for “bad guys”. criminals would instead use smaller banknotes, or gold or diamonds, but these are big so criminals cannot carry them easily”, he said.the purple €500 note was introduced in 2002: it replaced the 1,000 deutschmark, the 10,000 belgian franc and the 500,000 italian lira. in germany and austria, people still pay with paper money and coins more than half the time.europol would like central banks to take more responsibility for what happens with €500 notes. eu finance ministers have asked banks and authorities to look at whether countries should limit high-value notes or get rid of them.nannannannan
elementary	volcanoes, hurricanes and earthquakes can make a city totally disappear. but there are two other things that can make it disappear, too ð water and sand.one hundred years ago, venice ð one of the most beautiful and low-lying cities in the world ð used to  ood about ten times a year. now, its lowest point, piazza san marco (only three feet above sea level)  oods approximately 100 times a year.but rising sea levels are not the only cause. in many parts of the world, the land is also sinking. in venice, the city sank by 20cm between 1950 and 1970. ho chi minh city in vietnam is also sinking by about 2cm a year ð but the situation in jakarta is much worse ð it is sinking 10 to 20cm every year. in the past three decades, the city has sunk four metres.the indonesian capital has pumped out so much water to support its population that the land above is too dry. this is creating a bowl.there are many plans to save venice, and ho chi minh city and jakarta are taking the problem seriously. but it is not same in miami where politicians will not accept that the city has a serious problem.there are three main problems in miami. it is less than ten feet above sea level; an increasing number of tropical storms are  ooding the city; and it is built on porous rock, which absorbs the rising seawater. this water then  lls the cityõs foundations and comes up through drains and pipes. this forces sewage upwards and pollutes the cityõs fresh water. it is possible that it may, one day, be impossible to live in miami.in the maldives, the populations of whole islands may leave their homes. the capital is male. it has a population of 153,379 and is only four feet above sea level. male has built a ten-foot sea wall, which cost $63 million. but, in the long term, male and the rest of the islands will only be safe if sea levels stop rising.in africa, the sahara is getting bigger ð it is moving south at a rate of 30 miles per year. this is a problem for people who live in northern mauritania.people may have to leave the californian resort of rancho mirage, near palm springs, in the next decade. the problem in california is not caused by global warming ð the problem is that there are too many people there. in 1870, the total population was only half a million but, now, the state is home to 38 million people. and these people have 32 million cars.every person in rancho mirage uses more than 200 gallons of water every day. this is causing a man-made drought. they have reduced water use by 25% but this will probably not make much difference. the long-term answer in californiaõs desert is for people to leave some cities.fire is a growing problem to towns and cities in america ð in fact, forest  res cause the most damage after bad storms. there were 800 major  re disasters there between 1953 and 2014. a new report by the usda forest service shows the increasing number of towns and cities that are particularly vulnerable to wild re.many cities are  ghting a losing battle against nature but is it possible to choose the worlds most vulnerable city? natural disasters are very dif cult to predict  but the future for male does look very bad. its new sea wall might continue to work but the islands around the maldives capital are going to disappear soon. and, if they disappear, males reason for existing disappears, too.nannannannan
elementary	there are bird droppings in one of britain’s most expensive houses. pigeon skeletons lie among broken mirrors and water is coming through the walls. this is the tower, a £30m palace in “billionaires’ row” in north london.it is one of ten mansions in the middle of the bishops avenue that have been empty for many years. the saudi arabian royal family bought it. their grecian columns are cracking into pieces and mosaic-tiled swimming pools are filled with broken stones. nature has taken control and owls have moved in.you see the same thing again and again on the avenue. lloyds bank says the bishops avenue is the second most expensive street in britain. house prices in london are rising at 11.2% a year. more and more people find it difficult to buy a house, but 16 mansions on the most expensive part of the bishops avenue are empty. their gates are locked and there are guard dogs in their overgrown gardens.across the street stands another empty mansion worth £18m. it has broken windows and its walls are painted with anti-climb paint. metal bars block the windows of another mansion, which has sold for £20m.for people who find it very difficult to keep a roof above their heads in one of the world’s most expensive cities, seeing the empty houses can be painful. one security guard who works on the avenue said it was annoying to see so many mansions – enough for many people to live in – falling apart.rich royals from nigeria and saudi arabia came to this road near hampstead heath first. iranians came here after the fall of the shah. now, chinese house hunters are following russians and kazakhs who have spent millions to get an address that estate agents tell them is as world famous as the champs elysées and rodeo drive. recently, two mansions have been on sale for £65m and £38m.but in the grounds of the empty mansions, stone fountains crumble. inside one mansion, the ceiling has collapsed and water drips through a huge crystal chandelier onto a thick carpet, which is rotting. moss grows through bricks and mirrored tiles are lying on a bathroom floor. the swimming pool is filled with dirty water and has flowers growing through its tiles. the wood in the sauna is coming off the walls.but it is the ruin of the towers, a grand mansion, that is most dramatic. there are pigeons in its huge, high-ceiling halls and its walls are bright green with algae.today, very few people live on the bishops avenue all the time. a security guard outside one mansion said that the owners were not there. another guard outside royal mansion would not say if anyone was home and a member of staff at another mansion warned the guardian about the guard dogs.magdy adib ishak-hannah, who has £45m, said he is one of the few residents who lives there all the time.“i have never seen what my neighbours look like. next door, a saudi princess spent £35m on a new house and i’ve never seen her. there are about three houses that are lived in 24/7 and half of the houses are lived in three to six months a year. the other half, who knows if they come or not?” he said.the reason for the multimillion-pound ruins is that some of the world’s richest people see british houses as an investment.anil varma, who develops homes and then sells them, wants to build £5m apartments, instead of £50m mansions, to try to bring people back.he has decided to rebuild one of the most expensive sites on the avenue as a collection of 20 apartments with a concierge, maid service, 25-metre pool, spa and cinema.nannannan
elementary	two scientists at stanford university, in the usa, used metadata on people’s telephone calls and texts to find out people’s names, where they lived and the names of their partners. the metadata told them what number people called, when and for how long but it didn’t tell them what people said.but, that was not all. with the same metadata, they could find out private information about some people. they discovered that one man had a gun and that another man had a heart problem. other data told them that someone was having a baby and someone had a serious illness.the results show the extraordinary power of telephone metadata. it is particularly powerful when you use it together with information from google, yelp and facebook.stewart baker, who worked at the us national security agency (nsa), said “metadata tells you everything about somebody’s life.”patrick mutchler, a researcher at stanford, said that people who collect the information understand the power of metadata but that the public was in the dark.for the study, 823 people agreed for researchers to collect metadata from their phones using an app. the app also received information from their facebook pages, which the scientists used to check their results. the scientists collected metadata on more than 250,000 calls and over 1.2 million texts.with very little money, mutchler and jonathan mayer found out a lot of personal information about the people in the study. some of the information was private. they found out 82% of people’s names. the same method gave them the names of businesses the people called. when they marked these on a map, they showed groups of local businesses, which the scientists guessed were near the person’s home address. in this way, they named the city people lived in 57% of the time and were nearly 90% correct in guessing, within 50 miles, where people lived.then, the scientists used a simple computer program to analyse people’s calls and this helped them to see who was in a relationship. once they knew the owner of a particular phone number had a partner, it was easy to find out who the partner was, they said.for the final part of the study, the researchers looked even deeper to see what private information they could get from telephone metadata. they collected details on calls made to and from places such as hospitals, pharmacies, religious groups, legal services and gun shops. from these, they produced interesting pictures of people’s lives.mutchler said the study showed how easy it is to find out private information about people. he says that the results should make governments think twice before they record this information. “metadata programmes, like the nsa’s, will show very private information about ordinary people,” the scientists said.nannannan
elementary	some cities have pigeons. lima has black vultures. they fly in groups over the city and sit on the city’s buildings. with their wrinkly heads and small, round eyes, they remind lima residents of the poverty and filth in their city.but the vultures’ taste for dead and decaying things has become a good thing. environmental authorities are putting gopro video cameras and gps trackers on the birds – the birds now work in the fight against fly-tipping and illegal dumping.samuel is one of the project’s ten black vultures that are looking for rubbish. he wears his tracker and flies above the city, where he finds secret or hidden dumps. the exact positions of the rubbish dumps are recorded on a live map.his trainer at lima’s huachipa zoo, alfredo correa, says, “they can eat dead animals because their bodies protect them from viruses and bacteria,” he says.usaid and the peruvian environment ministry are working together on this project to try to solve lima’s rubbish problem. the vultures are fighting disease, while most humans ignore the danger.lima has nearly ten million inhabitants but just four landfills so there are many illegal dumps. a fifth of the city’s rubbish goes into the illegal dumps, according to the environment ministry. the rubbish makes the water of lima’s main water source, the rimac river, dirty. it also makes the water of the chillon and lurin rivers, which flow into the bay of lima, dirty.three poorer districts have only 12% of lima’s population but they have much more illegal rubbish than other neighbourhoods: villa maria del triunfo (39.4%), villa el salvador (25.3%) and el agustino (18.3%).part of the problem is unpaid taxes. many residents don’t pay their taxes. that means some of the 43 districts of the city do not have enough money for rubbish collection.it also means that it is possible that nobody is going to clean up where the vultures find illegal rubbish. “we tell the local governments where the vultures found illegal dumps,” says javier hernandez, the project director. “it’s their job to collect the rubbish and to try and change the habits of their residents.”nannannan
elementary	bb king was most famous for blues music but he was always interested in other types of music and different cultures. perhaps it is too early to say he is òthe last of the bluesmenó but it is hard to imagine that any future blues artist will have the in uence as bb king. he in uenced thousands of musicians and millions of music fans in a career that lasted 65 years.riley b king was born in mississippi, the son of african-american farm workers. he learnt the guitar from a family friend and learnt to sing with a quartet of gospel singers. in his early 20s, he moved to memphis.he was soon playing regularly at a bar in west memphis and he also became a disc jockey, with a show on a local radio station. he was known as òthe beale street blues boyó but this was shortened to òblues boy kingó and then to òbbó. in 1950, king began recording for modern records.he had his  rst hit in 1952 with three oõclock blues. it was number one in the r&b chart for 15 weeks; it was the  rst of many hits. king developed a style that was new and different but had its roots in blues history. he often praised the musicians who in uenced him and he usually mentioned t-bone walker  rst. he also mentioned the earlier blues guitarists blind lemon jefferson and lonnie johnson and the jazz players charlie christian and django reinhardt.he once explained that his guitar technique was partly the result of his lack of skill: òi started to bend notes because i could never play in the bottleneck style. i loved that sound but just couldnõt do it.ó during the 1950s, king was the leading blues artist in many series of concerts. in 1956, he played 342 concerts. in 1962, he tried to change that working pattern by signing with a major label, abc. but the  rst records under that contract were not very successful with his fans or with the record company. but his 1965 album, live at the regal, has become famous and in uenced many younger musicians. he had more r&b hits with blues songs and, in 1969, he was near the top of the pop charts ð where no blues artist had been for many years ð with a song called the thrill is gone.it was a long time before he became known to a rock audience but musicians who admired him brought him to the attention of rock fans. òabout a year and a half ago,ó he said in 1969, òkids suddenly started saying to me, ôyouõre the greatest blues guitarist in the world.õ and iõd say, ôwho told you that?õ and theyõd say, ômike bloom eldõ or ôeric claptonõ. these young musicians made me popular again.ófrom then on, king was well known as a leading blues artist. he went on international concert tours to japan, australia, china and russia. he also gave concerts to prisoners in chicago and at san quentin. in 1990, doctors told king he had diabetes and he reduced his touring. he now had to play sitting down but his singing and playing were almost as good as ever. the celebrations for his 80th birthday, in 2005, included an award-winning album with clapton, mark knop er, roger daltrey, gloria estefan and others, tributes from bono, amadou bagayoko and elton john, and a ògoodbye touró that was not a goodbye at all.in 2009, king received a grammy award, for best traditional blues album, for one kind favor. in 2012, he performed at a concert at the white house, where the us president, barack obama, joined him to sing sweet home chicago. king was twice married and twice divorced. he is survived by 11 children by various partners; four others died before him.nannan
elementary	according to a new survey, there are more tigers in nepal than at any time since the 1970s. the number of big cats has been decreasing in south asia for 100 years, but conservationists now hope that we can save them.the number of wild royal bengal tigers in nepal has increased to 198 – a 63.6% increase in five years – the survey showed. “this is very good news,” said maheshwar dhakal, an ecologist with nepal’s department of national parks and wildlife conservation.the survey looked at pictures from more than 500 cameras in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors. more than 250 conservationists and wildlife experts worked on the survey, which cost about £250,000. dhakal said that there was a similar survey in india and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013. “it will take a few more months for india, which now has 1,300 big cats in several huge protected areas, to finish the survey,” he added. nepal says it will double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 to 242.some rich people want tiger skins. tiger body parts are used in traditional chinese medicine. international gangs pay poor local nepali people large amounts of money to kill the cats. the skin and bones are taken through the border to india, where the big dealers are.one big problem is that some senior officials help the mafia who are involved in the illegal buying and selling. conservation experts believe that tiger numbers have increased because the police are controlling national parks better, and because there is now better management of tiger habitats in nepal, where forests cover 29% of the land. but they say nepal must do more to protect the habitat and animals that tigers eat so the big cats have enough space to move around and food to eat.the number of tigers has increased but attacks on villagers have increased, too. seven people were killed in attacks by tigers around national parks in 2012 compared to four in 2011, park officials said. villagers also want better protection. “the government is making conservation plans for tigers. but it should also make plans to protect people from tigers,” krishna bhurtel, a village leader, told a nepali newspaper. recently, a tiger was captured after it killed two people, including a villager who was pulled from his bed in may.thousands of tigers used to lived in the forests in bangladesh, india and nepal. but their numbers have decreased to about 3,000, a 95% decrease in one hundred years. chitwan national park in central nepal has the most adult tigers, with 120, followed by bardiya national park (50) and shukla phanta wildlife reserve (17).tiger skins are popular in tibet, where rich people use them as festival costumes. in nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins for special occasions. some rich nepali have tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms. tiger bones are in high demand for use in traditional chinese medicine. people can make a lot of money selling tiger skins and bones illegally.nan
advanced	a major international row with wide-ranging 1 implications for global drugs policy has erupted over the right of bolivia’s indigenous indian tribes to chew coca leaves, the principal ingredient in cocaine. bolivia has obtained a special exemption from the 1961 single convention on narcotic drugs, the framework that governs international drugs policy, allowing its indigenous people to chew the leaves.bolivia had argued that the convention was 2 in opposition to its new constitution, adopted in 2009, which obliges it to “protect native and ancestral coca as cultural patrimony” and maintains that coca “in its natural state … is not a narcotic”.south american indians have chewed coca 3 leaves for centuries. the leaves reputedly provide energy and are said to have medicinal qualities. supporters of bolivia’s position praised it for standing up for the rights of indigenous people. “the bolivian move is inspirational and groundbreaking,” said danny kushlick, head of external affairs at the transform drug policy foundation, which promotes drug liberalization. “it shows that any country that has had enough of the war on drugs can change the terms of its engagement with the un conventions.”however, the un’s international narcotics control 4 board (incb), which monitors implementation of the global drug treaties, has accused bolivia of threatening the integrity of the international drug control regime. a number of countries – including the uk, the us, italy, sweden, the netherlands and russia – opposed bolivia’s demands.the uk’s submission to the un, which oversees 5 the convention, said that it “acknowledges and respects the cultural importance of the coca leaf in bolivia”, but it adds: “the united kingdom is … concerned that the reservation could lead to increases in coca production and – crucially – the amount of coca diverted to the cocaine trade. as such, the reservation would weaken international law as it relates to the global effort to tackle the drugs trade and could weaken the international community’s response to that trade.”the right of indigenous communities in south 6 america’s andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed up to the convention. but, under the terms of the agreement, bolivia was given 25 years to implement the ban. this expired in 1989 and since then the issue has been under dispute.in 2011, bolivia – whose president, evo morales, 7 is a former coca producer – formally notified the un of its withdrawal from the convention. on friday it reacceded to the convention, but with an exemption from the prohibition on the chewing of coca leaves.the move is the first of its kind in the history 8 of un drug-control treaties and has sparked concerns that other countries may apply for amendments. the russian government has argued that the move will lead to “an increase in illegal circulation of cocaine” and warned that “it also sets a dangerous precedent that could be used by other states in creating a more liberal drug-control regime”.the british parliament’s home affairs select 9 committee has recommended that bolivia’s request should be backed by the uk government, arguing that it was important that countries remained within the single convention. bolivia’s re-accession could be blocked only if a third or more of the 184 countries that have signed up to the convention opposed its request. there are suspicions that the us and uk are frantically lobbying other countries to gain sufficient numbers to block bolivia’s request.nancie prud’homme, projects director at the 10 international centre on human rights and drug policy, criticized the co-ordinated opposition to bolivia’s demands. “these objections are legally questionable,” she said. “they support an arbitrary and over-broad provision and apply international drug laws in a vacuum. this is not appropriate. no state has paid any attention to decades of developing international norms on cultural and indigenous rights, which support bolivia’s efforts.”the decision to ban coca chewing was based on 11 a 1950 report produced by the un commission of inquiry on the coca leaf, which proponents of drug liberalization say was not based on supporting evidence. in an interview in 1949, the head of the commission, howard b fonda, signalled his opposition to the chewing of coca leaves before his inquiry had begun. fonda told an interviewer: “we believe that the daily, inveterate use of coca leaves by chewing … is not only thoroughly noxious and therefore detrimental, but is also the cause of racial degeneration in many centres of population, and of the decadence that visibly shows in numerous indians … our studies will confirm the certainty of our assertions and we hope we can present a rational plan of action … to attain the absolute and sure abolition of this pernicious habit.”the growing of coca leaves is legal and licensed 12 in bolivia. the policy has been credited with a fall in cocaine production in the country, leading some experts to see the bolivian model as a way forward for other countries.
advanced	it has been called ‘the hotel of mum and dad’ but few guesthouses have such favourable terms. as the housing crisis bites, a fifth of young adults are staying in the family home until they are at least 26 and the same proportion are not paying a penny towards their keep. a recent survey found that the proportion of adults living at home varied around the country, from just under 9% in the east midlands to more than double that in london, where house prices and rents are highest. while many around the country contributed financially, the survey found that 20% were paying nothing at all.young adults are being squeezed by low wages and rents, which have hit record highs, while those who want to buy a property are finding the monthly cost of renting is preventing them from saving enough to get on the housing ladder. research published by the homeless charity shelter showed half of tenants were unable to save a penny towards a deposit, while a quarter could only put by £100 or less each month. mortgages are cheaper than ever before thanks to record low interest rates but the best deals are still reserved for borrowers with large deposits.faced with this, young adults are increasingly returning to the family home in order to save money and parents who cannot afford to offer their offspring a lump sum seem willing to help. the survey found that 28% of adults were living at home because they were trying to save for a deposit. however, it also found that 30% were not saving any money.a spokesman for the company conducting the survey commented: “the hotel of mum and dad is often staying open for longer than many anticipated, our latest research shows. rental costs and deposits or the need to save for a mortgage deposit mean that some children understandably have to wait before flying the nest. and, for some, moving out may never be an option.”michael day, 30, who lives with his parents in bristol, says he has been caught between paying high rents and saving for a mortgage deposit. rents for a one-bedroom home in the city are between £500 and £800 a month, while buying a similar property would cost about £130,000. “i don’t really want to move out to rent as it’s more than a mortgage but you need such a big deposit to get a mortgage so it’s been a bit of a vicious circle.”day does not want to share with strangers so his options are limited. at home, he pays a nominal rent to cover bills and is able to keep the rest of his earnings from his job at a candle retailer. he plays golf at county level and he admits that, instead of saving, he spends his spare cash on golf and holidays. “you need so much money that i will have to save for the foreseeable future,” he said. “because it’s been so difficult, i’ve been going on holiday and enjoying it.”sue green, of saga, a business that sells insurance and products to the over-50s, said the majority of parents may not have planned to have their children living with them well into their 20s or 30s. “most will be more than happy to house them in the family home rent-free because it might help their kids get on the property ladder sooner,” she said. “children who don’t pay rent may contribute in other ways like buying groceries, family takeaways or doing odd jobs around the home.”angus hanton, co-founder of a thinktank called the intergenerational foundation, said older generations were “the architects of the housing crisis” and children should not be blamed for staying at home. “the under-30s have suffered a fall in average incomes of about 20% since the 2008 downturn. rents and car insurance have never been so high and mortgage lending rules have been tightened for the young but not for older buy-to-let investors, who squeeze out the young,” he said. “student-fee debt is rising rapidly yet many jobs on offer – zerohour and short-term contracts – are turning younger workers into second-class citizens. rather than blaming the young, we should be standing up for their interests so they can afford to build lives of their own.”jenna gavin, 29, lives in southport, merseyside, in the family home where she grew up. she moved out for a year to go to university but has been living with her parents ever since. she works as a medical receptionist nearby so she wants to stay in the area. but renting a one-bedroom flat would cost more than £420 a month before bills, which would take up a lot of her earnings. “i don’t want to rent – i don’t want to spend all that money and have nothing at the end,” she said. “i’ve looked at buying and seen mortgage advisers but i just can’t borrow enough to get on the property ladder.”gavin is trying to save but is struggling to amass the necessary funds. “you don’t really see it building up as much as you need – even a 5% deposit is such a lot of money and i would like to put down more,” she said. her parents are happy not to charge her rent. “they want me to try to save up and i contribute in other ways – i bring food in and i do things around the house.”gavin gets on with her parents and has her own space in a room that she moved into when she was 14 but she said she had always imagined she would have her own place by the time she was 30. “i don’t see that happening as it’s next year. but, hopefully, in a couple of years, i’ll have moved out.”
advanced	there comes a time in some men’s lives when the days seem darker, mortality more certain, and the only sensible response is to blow the life savings on a sportscar.radical and often ill-advised changes in lifestyle have become the calling cards of the midlife crisis but, if it is more than a myth, then humans may not be the only animals to experience it.now an international team of scientists claims to have found evidence for a slump in well-being among middle-aged chimpanzees and orangutans. the lull in happiness in the middle years, they say, is the ape equivalent of the midlife crisis.the study, which was published in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences, has raised eyebrows among some scientists but, according to the authors, the findings suggest that the midlife crisis may have its roots in the biology humans share with our closest evolutionary cousins.“there’s a common understanding that there’s a dip in well-being in middle age,” alex weiss, a psychologist at edinburgh university, told the guardian.“we took a step back and asked whether it’s possible that instead of the midlife crisis being human-specific, and driven only by social factors, it reflects some evolved tendency for middle-aged individuals to have lower well-being,” he said.the team from the us, japan, germany and the uk asked zookeepers, carers and others who worked with male and female apes of various ages to complete questionnaires on the animals.the forms included questions about each ape’s mood, the enjoyment they gained from socializing, and their success at achieving certain goals. the final question asked how carers would feel about being the ape for a week. they scored their answers from one to seven.more than 500 apes were included in the study in three separate groups. the first two groups were chimpanzees, with the third made up of orangutans from sumatra or borneo. the animals came from zoos, sanctuaries and research centres in the us, australia, japan, canada and singapore.when the researchers analyzed the questionnaires, they found that well-being in the apes fell in middle age and climbed again as the animals moved into old age. in captivity, great apes often live to 50 or more. the nadir in the animals’ well-being occurred, on average, at 28.3 and 27.2 years old for the chimpanzees, and 35.4 years old for the orangutans.“in all three groups we find evidence that well-being is lowest in chimpanzees and orangutans at an age that roughly corresponds to midlife in humans,” weiss said. “on average, well-being scores are lowest when animals are around 30 years old.”the team explains that the temporary fall in ape well-being may result from watching depressed apes dying younger, or through age-related changes in the brain that are mirrored in humans.weiss conceded that, unlike men, apes are not known to pursue radical and often disastrous lifestyle changes in middle age.robin dunbar, professor of evolutionary psychology at oxford university, was dubious about the findings. “what can produce a sense of well-being or contentedness that varies across the lifespan like this? it’s hard to see anything in an ape’s life that would have that sort of pattern, that they would think about. they’re not particularly good at seeing far ahead into the future; that’s one of the big differences between them and us.”alexandra freund, professor of psychology at the university of zurich, was also sceptical. she said the concept of a midlife crisis was shaky even in humans. “in my reading of the literature, there is no evidence for the midlife crisis. if there’s any indication of decline in emotional or subjective well-being it is very small and, in many studies, it’s not there at all.”but weiss believes the findings could point to a deeper understanding of the emotional crisis some men may experience. “if we want to find the answer as to what’s going on with the midlife crisis, we should look at what is similar in middle-aged humans, chimps and orangutans,” he said.
advanced	facebook has lost millions of users per month in its biggest markets, independent data suggests, as alternative social networks attract the attention of those looking for fresh online playgrounds.as facebook prepares to update investors on its performance in the first three months of the year, with analysts forecasting revenues up 36% on last year, studies suggest that its expansion in the us, uk and other major european countries has peaked.in the last month, the world’s largest social network has lost 6m us visitors, a 4% fall, according to analysis firm socialbakers. in the uk, 1.4m fewer users checked in in march, a fall of 4.5%. the declines are sustained. in the last six months, facebook has lost nearly 9m monthly visitors in the us and 2m in the uk.users are also switching off in canada, spain, france, germany and japan, where facebook has some of its biggest followings. a spokeswoman for facebook declined to comment.“the problem is that, in the us and uk, most people who want to sign up for facebook have already done it,” said new media specialist ian maude at enders analysis. “there is a boredom factor where people like to try something new. is facebook going to go the way of myspace? the risk is relatively small, but that is not to say it isn’t there.”alternative social networks such as instagram, the photo-sharing site that won 30m users in 18 months before facebook acquired the business, have seen surges in popularity with younger age groups.path, the mobile phone-based social network founded by former facebook employee dave morin, which restricts its users to 150 friends, is gaining 1m users a week. it has recently topped 9m users, with 500,000 venezuelans downloading the app in a single weekend.facebook is still growing fast in south america. monthly visitors in brazil were up 6% in the last month to 70m, according to socialbakers, whose information is used by facebook advertisers. india has seen a 4% rise to 64m – still a fraction of the country’s population, leaving room for further growth.but in developed markets, other facebook trackers are reporting declines. analysts at jefferies bank have developed an algorithm that interfaces directly with facebook software and it “suggests user levels in [the first quarter] may have declined from peak”.jefferies saw global numbers peak at 1.05bn a month in january, before falling by 20m in february. numbers rose again in april. the network has now lost nearly 2m visitors in the uk since december, according to research firm nielsen, with its 27m total flat on a year before.the number of minutes americans spend on facebook appears to be falling, too. the total was 121 billion minutes in december 2012, but that fell to 115 billion minutes in february, according to comscore.as facebook itself has warned, the time spent on its pages from those sitting in front of personal computers is declining rapidly because we are switching our screen time to smartphones and tablets.while smartphone minutes have doubled in a year, to 69 a month, that growth is not guaranteed to compensate for dwindling desktop usage.facebook is the most authoritative source on its own user numbers, and the firm will update investors on its performance for the quarter. wall street expects revenues of about $1.44bn, up from $1.06bn in 2012.shareholders will be particularly keen to learn how fast facebook’s mobile user base is growing, and whether advertising revenues are increasing at the same rate.mobile usage represented nearly a quarter of facebook’s advertising income at the end of 2012, and the network had 680m mobile users a month in december.the company warned in recent stockmarket filings that it might be losing “younger users” to “other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, facebook”.wary of competition from services that were invented for the mobile phone rather than the pc, founder mark zuckerberg has recently driven through a series of new initiatives designed to appeal to smartphone users. the most significant is facebook home, software that can be downloaded onto certain android phones to feed news and photos from friends – and advertising – directly to the owner’s locked home screen.
advanced	the beginning of the year is probably prime-time for feeling glum about work: it’s ages until the next holiday, and it’s dark in the morning and when you get home. and, if you’re stuck in a job you don’t like, it could be enough to have you reaching for your cv. but, before you start hunting through the job ads, try to put things in perspective. so, what else could you be doing instead? we asked fi ve people doing some unusual jobs how much they are paid, what the worst parts are and why they enjoy their work.1. dog-food taster the job: tasting dog food to make sure it meets a premium brand’s quality standardswhat it involves: opening sample tins of each freshly made batch of dog (or cat) food, smelling it and eating it. “although dogs’ palates are different from ours, taste is an important quality check to ensure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced in just the right way,” says philip wells, the chief taster for lily’s kitchen pet food. “trying the food is also a good way to pick up on the nuances of the cooking; this works especially well on the dry food.”typical salary: £20,000 for an entry-level job in the quality department. however, wells says £50,000 or more is “easily achievable” for an experienced technical director who, as well as tasting products, is also likely to be responsible for developing new recipes and advising the business on technical and regulatory matters.worst part of the job: the deadlines, for wells, who admits he quite likes the food. the meat used in pet food has to be derived from animals passed as fi t for human consumption, under the animal feed regulations 2010, and he says the fi rm uses “human-grade freshly prepared raw food” in its recipes. he adds: “there are some pretty gruesome pet foods out there and, although i don’t taste them, the smell is enough to turn the stomach when i do a bit of market research.”job satisfaction: “no two days are ever the same.” it’s rewarding, wells says, that a project he has worked on will “help pets to become happier and healthier”. however, he acknowledges that some of the credit must go to another “key member” of the tasting team: lily, the border terrier.2. hygiene technician the job: disinfecting areas that have potentially been exposed to bio-hazardous situationswhat it involves: cleaning up crime scenes, road accidents and suicides. clearing hoarders’ houses full of rubbish, rats and excrement … among other things. “the job is about keeping people safe,” says richard lewis, a hygiene technician for rentokil. “we deal with some very disturbingly dirty sites.”typical salary: the entry-level salary is usually around £14,500 and a top salary can be up to £22,000.worst part of the job: cleaning up after suicides. “you get used to the job being disgusting but the emotional side of it is still hard.” you learn not to take your work home with you, he says. “you also need to have a sense of humour, as some days can be tough.”job satisfaction: lewis fi nds the variety of tasks exciting. “one day, i’m cleaning up after a dead body; another day, i’m in a prison cell or 100 feet in the air being lowered down into a silo to clean it.” he also takes pride in the transformation he brings about: “it’s satisfying to return a potentially hazardous site back to a safe environment. and it benefi ts society.”3. biogas engineer the job: setting up biogas plants in developing countrieswhat it involves: linking a system of digesters – which can be fi lled with human excrement, animal dung and other waste products – to toilets to produce a biogas that can be used for cooking and lighting. “you have to know what size and shape the mixing pit needs to be, how to create the optimum temperature for digestion and where to situate the biogas plant,” says baburam paudel, chief technical offi cer in nepal for the charity renewable world. “you also have to convince poor communities that poo can be productive – many are repelled by the idea of connecting their toilets to their kitchens.”typical salary: an entry-level salary is around £10,000, while a typical salary for a chief technical offi cer is £30,000.worst part of the job: for paudel, it’s seeing people struggling to survive on very little income. but, he admits, anyone who won’t change a nappy would struggle. “you have to be willing to get your hands dirty during the build process and inspections. unsurprisingly, the anaerobic digestion (the process that takes place when bacteria eat the decomposing waste and produce methane) smells like rotten eggs. it can be disgusting and there is no room for mistakes.”job satisfaction: “i fi nd it immensely satisfying to know that i am helping people to increase their incomes and allowing girls to attend school by replacing the need to collect fi rewood,” says paudel. “my work improves the health and hygiene of whole communities.”4. eel ecologist the job: conserving the critically endangered european eelwhat it involves: to monitor the size of the endangered eels, ecologists wade into the thames and other london rivers and marshes full of eels, sometimes up to their armpits, and reach into a net fi lled with up to 20 adult eels to grab one with their bare hands. “adult eels can be a metre long, or even larger, and weigh up to 2kg. they’re not at all dangerous but they are almost pure muscle and they can be a little bit slimy,” says stephen mowat, an eel conservationist and ecologist for the zoological society of london. “we have to weigh and measure them, and they wriggle … a lot. it’s diffi cult to look professional while crawling on the ground chasing an eel across the grass.”worst part of the job: “eels are really tricky creatures to work with – and getting outsmarted by an eel can be quite embarrassing,” says mowat. “you also have to be ready to jump from one project to the next. i once had to dissect a tub of dead eels to examine parasites living in them, moments before jumping into a suit for a meeting with government offi cials. i remembered to wash my hands.” but, for mowat, the worst part of the job is defi nitely not handling the eels – he believes baby eels (known as elvers) are “as cute as pandas”: “the worst thing about the job is regularly learning how much damage we, the british population, are doing to the environment.”job satisfaction: “getting to work outdoors and seeing british wildlife up close is the best part of the job,” says mowat. “eels are beautiful creatures and working with eels doesn’t just benefi t the eel: it helps whole river systems, estuaries and coastal habitats. that is something worth working on.”5. shopping channel presenter the job: selling and demonstrating a wide range of products on live tvwhat it involves: presenting hours and hours of monotonous content, while simultaneously demonstrating the products and appearing to be enthusiastic and knowledgeable about everything that you’re selling. “i prepare and research as much technical and practical information as possible on every single product beforehand,” says shaun ryan, presenter for ideal world tv. “but you also need the ability to relate to every genre of products and to every viewer.”typical salary: a trainee presenter would start on a minimum of £30,000, while an experienced presenter can expect over £55,000.worst part of the job: “the unsociable hours,” says ryan. “an experienced presenter like myself generally gets to work prime-time hours, which means all weekends, bank holidays and very late evenings, plus the occasional 5am shift.” his worst task ever, he says, was singlehandedly having to sell some female slimming pants: “it was a very tricky hour and not my fi nest.”job satisfaction: “i love the rush of live presenting and having to think on my feet every second,” says ryan. “i also get an adrenaline rush from knowing that, at times, i have thousands of viewers ordering the product that i have just been presenting.”
advanced	more than a third of all women worldwide – 35.6% – will experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, usually from a male partner, according to the first comprehensive study of its kind from the world health organization (who). the report reveals the shocking extent of attacks on women from the men with whom they share their lives, with 30% of women being attacked by partners. it also finds that a large proportion of murders of women – 38% – are carried out by intimate partners.“these findings send a powerful message that violence against women is a global health problem of epidemic proportions,” said dr margaret chan, director general of the who. “we also see that the world’s health systems can and must do more for women who experience violence.”the highest levels of violence against women are in africa, where nearly half of all women – 45.6% – will suffer physical or sexual violence. in low- and middle-income europe, the proportion is 27.2%. yet, wealthier nations are not necessarily always safer for women – a third of women in high-income countries (32.7%) will experience violence at some stage in their lives. of the women who suffer violence, 42% sustain injuries, which can bring them to the attention of healthcare staff. that, says the report, is often the first opportunity for violence in the home to be detected and for the woman to be offered help. violence has a profound effect on women’s health. some arrive at hospital with broken bones, while others suffer pregnancy-related complications and mental illness.the two reports from the who – one on the prevalence of violence, the other offering guidelines to healthcare staff on helping women – are the work of dr claudia garcia-moreno, lead specialist in gender, reproductive rights, sexual health and adolescence at who, and professor charlotte watts, an epidemiologist who specializes in gender, violence and health, from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine.“for the first time, we have compared data from all over the world on the magnitude of partner violence and sexual violence by non-partners and the impact of these sorts of violence on health,” said garcia-moreno. these included hiv and other sexually transmitted infections, depression, women turning to alcohol, unwanted pregnancies and low-birthweight babies.there were variations in the rates of violence against women in different regions of the world but, said garcia-moreno, “in whatever region we looked at, it is unacceptably high”. even in high-income countries, 23.2% of women will suffer physical and/or sexual violence from a partner in their lives, their data from 81 countries shows. the global figure for women attacked by partners was 30%.more sexual assaults and rapes by acquaintances or strangers are reported in high-income countries than elsewhere – the report says that 12.6% of women in wealthy countries will be sexually attacked by a non-partner in their lives, which is higher than the african rate of 11.9%. but, the data on such crimes is not well collected in all regions.the authors say that their previous research shows that better-educated women are less likely to suffer violence, as are those who have jobs, although not in all regions. there is a need to tackle social norms, said watts. “what is society’s attitude concerning the acceptability of certain forms of violence against women?” she asked. “in some societies, it is not ok – but not all.”“i think the numbers are a wake-up call for all of us to pay more attention to this issue,” said garcia-moreno. over the past decade, there has been increasing recognition of the problem, she said, but “one has to recognize that it is a complex problem. we don’t have a vaccine or a pill”.the new who clinical and policy guidelines recommend training for healthcare staff in recognizing the signs of domestic violence and sexual assault, but they rule out general screening – there is not a case for asking every woman who arrives in a clinic whether she has been subjected to violence.“but, if you see a woman coming back several times with undisclosed injuries, you should be asking about domestic violence,” said garcia-moreno. “when i was training in medical school, it wasn’t something you learned or knew about. years later, i was sometimes in a situation where i could tell there was something else going on in the woman i was interviewing, but didn’t have any sense that domestic violence was the issue. now, i think i would handle the interview very differently.”
advanced	more than one million british workers might be employed on zero-hours contracts, new  gures reveal, suggesting that british business is using the controversial employment terms far more widely than previously thought.the  gure ð derived from a poll of more than 1,000 employers conducted by the chartered institute of personnel and development (cipd) ð prompted renewed calls for the government to launch a full inquiry into the use of the contracts, after a week in which a string of organizations ð from retail chains to buckingham palace ð have faced criticism for hiring staff but offering no guarantee of work and pay each week. employees on zero-hours contracts often get no holiday or sick pay and have to ask permission before seeking additional work elsewhere.the cipd found that 38% of zero-hours contract workers describe themselves as employed full-time, typically working 30 hours or more a week. one-third of voluntary sector employers use the contracts and one in four public sector organizations.the latest numbers also call into question the accuracy of of cial data on the topic. the of ce for national statistics has increased its estimate of the number of uk zero-hours workers by 25%, to around 250,000.peter cheese, the chief executive of the cipd, said: òthere does need to be a closer look at what is meant by a zero-hours contract, the different forms that they take and clearer guidance on what good and bad practice in their use looks like. and this needs to consider both the advantages and disadvantages in practice for businesses and employees.óretailer sports direct recently became the focus of controversy on zero-hours when it emerged that the company employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on the contracts. the retailerõs use of the contracts was followed by details of a string of other companies using the deals, including cinema chain cineworld and buckingham palace, which uses them for its 350 summer workers. pub group j d wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff ð 80% of its workforce ð on the terms.vidhya alakeson, from the resolution foundation, an independent think tank, added: òif itõs true that there are around one million people on zero-hours contracts, then that would be a substantial portion of the workforce ð this could no longer be dismissed as an issue affecting only a tiny minority.òthe new estimate underlines the urgent need for a deep and thorough review of zero-hours by the government, which takes into account not only the scale of the problem but the effect these contracts have on workersõ employment rights, earning capacity and personal well-being.óunions and poverty campaign groups have accused employers of pressuring staff into signing the contracts as a way to evade their responsibilities and cut staff bene ts.dave prentis, of the trade union unison, said: òthe vast majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice. they may give  exibility to a few, but the balance of power favours the employers and makes it hard for workers to complain.óworkers on zero-hours contracts are often only told how many hours they will work when weekly or monthly rotas are worked out, but are expected to be on call for extra work at short notice. they should be entitled to holiday pay in line with the number of hours they work, but do not qualify for sick pay.the charity national trust, which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts, said it offered the same pay and bene ts to those workers, pro rata, as full-time staff, but needed some workers to be on a more  exible arrangement.òwe believe zero-hours contracts are essential in our organization, as we are very weather- dependent,ó a spokeswoman said. òour properties have told us itõs important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.ópolitician chuka umunna said the contracts should be the exception to the rule. òwhile some employees welcome the  exibility of such contracts, for many, zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come,ó he said.some people have argued that the  exibility of zero-hours contracts may have allowed the uk to avoid higher levels of unemployment during the economic downturn, while the cipd research suggests that only 16% of those on zero-hours contracts report that their employer frequently fails to provide them with suf cient hours each week. the instituteõs  gures also suggest that 17% of employers in the private sector made use of zero- hours contracts, considerably lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.industries where employers were most likely to report at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).
advanced	until the last, david bowie, who has died of cancer, was still capable of springing surprises. his latest album, blackstar, appeared on his 69th birthday on 8 january 2016 and proved that his gift for making dramatic statements as well as challenging, disturbing music hadn’t deserted him.throughout the 1970s, bowie was a trailblazer of musical trends and pop fashion. having been a late-60s mime and cabaret entertainer, he evolved into a singer-songwriter, a pioneer of glam-rock, then veered into what he called “plastic soul”, before moving to berlin to create innovative electronic music. his capacity for mixing brilliant changes of sound and image underpinned by a genuine intellectual curiosity is rivalled by few in pop history.bowie was born david robert jones in south london. in 1953, the family moved to kent, where david showed aptitude in singing and playing the recorder. later, he studied art, music and design. in 1961, david’s mother bought him a plastic saxophone, introducing him to an instrument which would become a recurring ingredient in his music.at 15, david formed his first band, the kon-rads. it was clear that david’s talents and ambition dictated that he should go solo. david adopted the name bowie to avoid confusion with davy jones of the monkees.bowie’s first album, released in june 1967, was titled simply david bowie. in july 1969, bowie released space oddity, the song that would give him his initial commercial breakthrough. timed to coincide with the apollo 11 moon landing, it was a top five uk hit.in march 1970, bowie married art student, angela barnett. artistically, bowie was powering ahead. the man who sold the world was released in the us in late 1970 and in the uk the following year, and with its daring songwriting and broody, hard-rock sound, it was the first album to do full justice to his writing and performing gifts. the album’s themes included immortality, insanity, murder and mysticism, evidence that bowie was a songwriter who was thinking way beyond pop’s usual boundaries.he followed it with 1972’s hunky dory, a mix of wordy, elaborate songwriting. it was an excellent collection that met with only moderate success but that all changed with the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars later that year.this time, bowie emerged as a fully fledged science-fiction character – an intergalactic glam-rock star visiting a doomed planet earth – and the album effectively wrote the script for his own stardom. the hit single starman brought instant success for the album, while bowie’s ravishing stage costumes and provocative performances triggered fan enthusiasm unseen since beatlemania.everything bowie touched turned to gold. he had his first uk number 1 album with aladdin sane (1973), which generated the hit singles the jean genie and drive-in saturday. but bowie was already planning fresh career moves.his increasing interest in funk and soul music came to the fore on the deliciously listenable young americans (1975), which gave him a us chart-topper with fame (featuring john lennon as a guest vocalist).station to station (1976) introduced a new persona, the thin white duke, which bowie had carried over from his headlining performance as a melancholy space traveller in nicolas roeg’s film the man who fell to earth.bowie’s relationship with his wife had been disintegrating under the pressures of success and the couple divorced in 1980. this was a year of further creative triumph, bringing a fine album, scary monsters (and super creeps), and its spinoff chart-topping single, ashes to ashes, followed by bowie’s well-received stint as john merrick in the elephant man on the broadway stage.he achieved a number 1 single with his 1981 partnership with queen, under pressure, while becoming increasingly involved in crossovers between different media. he appeared in the german movie christiane f (1981) and wrote music for the soundtrack. he had another chart hit with cat people (putting out fire) from paul schrader’s movie cat people (1982).bowie continued to make progress as a screen actor with appearances in the hunger and the second world war drama merry christmas, mr lawrence, both released in 1983. musically, this was the year in which he put his energy into an all-out commercial onslaught with the album let’s dance and follow-up concerts. let’s dance moulded bowie into a crowd-friendly global rock star, with the album and its singles let’s dance, china girl and modern love all becoming huge international hits.this was the heyday of mtv and bowie’s knack for eye-catching videos fuelled this commercial splurge, while the six-month serious moonlight tour drew massive crowds. it was to be the most commercially successful period of his career.his profile gained another boost from his appearance at the 1985 live aid famine relief concert at wembley stadium, where he was one of the standout performers. in addition, he teamed up with mick jagger to record the fundraising single dancing in the street, which sped to number 1.a few days after his appearance at the freddie mercury tribute concert at wembley stadium in april 1992, bowie married the somalian model iman and the couple bought a home in new york. this new start in his private life coincided with a search for fresh musical inspiration.for the album black tie white noise (1993), he sprinkled elements of soul, electronica and hip hop into the mix. it topped the uk album chart and yielded a top 10 single, jump they say.new media and technology influenced his recordings, too. his 1999 album hours… was based around music he had written for a computer game called omikron, in which bowie and iman appeared as characters. the birth of bowie and iman’s daughter, alexandria, followed in august 2000.as an adopted new yorker, bowie was the opening act at the concert for new york city in october 2001, where he joined paul mccartney, jon bon jovi, billy joel, the who and elton john in a benefit show six weeks after the 9/11 attacks.bowie was back in the studio the following year for reality. however, in the midst of his reality tour in 2004, bowie was stricken with chest pains while performing in germany and underwent emergency surgery in hamburg to clear a blocked artery.he took the medical emergency as a warning and reduced the pace of his activities. in 2006, he announced he would be taking a year off from touring and recording. in february that year, he was given a grammy lifetime achievement award, having been inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1996.the next day (2013) was his first album of new material in a decade. it contained the single where are we now?, which gave him his first uk top 10 hit since 1993. the album topped charts in britain and around the world. in 2014, bowie was given the brit award for best british male, making him the oldest british recipient in the awards’ history.he is survived by iman, their daughter, alexandria, his stepdaughter, zulekha, and his son, duncan, from his first marriage.
advanced	david mitchell, a regular contender for the man booker literary prize, is used to his novels being picked over by the critics. so, it’s something of a relief, says the british author, that his latest work – completed at 1am one tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to norway – won’t be seen by anyone until 2114.mitchell is the second contributor to the scottish artist katie paterson’s future library project, for which 1,000 trees were planted in 2014 in oslo’s nordmarka forest. starting with margaret atwood, who handed over the manuscript of a text called scribbler moon in 2015, each year for the next 100 years, an author will deliver a piece of writing that will only be read in 2114, when the trees are chopped down to make paper on which the 100 texts will be printed.each author – their names revealed year by year and chosen by a panel of experts and paterson, while she is alive – will make the trek to the spot in the forest high above oslo, where they will surrender their manuscripts in a short ceremony.“it’s a little glimmer of hope in a season of highly depressing news cycles, which affirms we are in with a chance of civilization in a hundred years,” said mitchell. “everything is telling us that we’re doomed but the future library is a candidate on the ballot paper for possible futures. it brings hope that we are more resilient than we think: that we will be here, that there will be trees, that there will be books and readers, and civilization.”mitchell said he found writing the book “quite liberating because i won’t be around to take the consequences of this being good or bad ... but, i’m sandwiched between margaret atwood and no doubt some other brilliant writer. so, it better be good. what a historic fool of epochal proportions i’d look if they opened it in 2114 and it wasn’t any good.”usually, says mitchell, who was shortlisted for the man booker for his novels number9dream and cloud atlas, he “polishes and polishes” his writing. “actually, i over-polish. but, this was very different – i wrote up to the wire. so, the first two-thirds were polished and the final third i didn’t have time. and, it was a liberation.”future library creator, paterson, whose past works have involved her mapping dead stars and compiling a slide archive of the history of darkness through the ages, asked the writers to tackle “the theme of imagination and time, which they can take in so many directions”. mitchell revealed only the name of the manuscript, from me flows what you call time, during a ceremony in the norwegian woods next to where paterson’s 1,000 trees are planted. the title is taken from a piece of music by japanese composer toru takemitsu but, other than admitting that “it’s somewhat more substantial a thing than i was expecting”, the author would say nothing.handing over his text in the forest, sheltered from the intermittent rain by an umbrella and amid the foot-high shoots of 1,000 pine trees, mitchell read his damp audience of children and adults a short story and william wordsworth’s a slumber did my spirit seal. its ending, “rolled round in earth’s diurnal course / with rocks, and stones, and trees”, felt appropriate in this small section of forest, carpeted with blueberry bushes, which will be carefully tended to for the next 98 years before it is turned into future library’s manuscripts.“how vain to suppose the scribblings of little old me will be of enduring interest to future generations. yet, how low-key and understated, to slave over a manuscript that nobody will ever pat you on the back for and say: ‘nice one’ or ‘god, i loved the bit where she did that and he did this ...’” mitchell wrote in a piece for the future library.his manuscript, now delivered, will be sealed and placed alongside atwood’s in a wood-lined room in oslo’s new public library, which will open in 2019. watched over by a trust of experts until it is finally printed, it is now, says the novelist, “as gone from me as a coin dropped in a river”.
advanced	david cameron, barack obama and pamela anderson have refused. george w bush, benedict cumberbatch and stephen hawking have taken part. as the ice bucket challenge notched up $100m for a us motor-neuronedisease charity and £4.5m for a british one, as well as thousands more for charities in hong kong and australia, the bracing cold water of a backlash has quickly followed.narcissistic celebrities showing off toned bodies, people having all the fun without donating, complaints about the waste of water – the attacks have come from commentators, animal-rights groups and environmentalists. and the us amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) association – which is not related to britain’s mnd association – also came under fire for the six-figure salaries being paid to its top staff.meanwhile, the challenge continues to grow. for anyone unaware of how it works, someone gives a short speech to camera about the charity, then dumps a bucket of ice cubes in water over their head, or gets a friend to do it, before nominating three people to either do the same or donate.it began in the us in july, although whether it was on a golf course or a baseball field depends on which version you prefer, and first appeared on mainstream american television on 15 july. but the als association has now been forced to withdraw an attempt to patent the phrase “ice bucket challenge” after criticism. “we understand the public’s concern and are withdrawing the trademark applications,” spokeswoman carrie munk said. the als has yet to respond to criticism of its high overheads and wage bills.the unfortunate coincidence that 31 august to 5 september was world water week, with international delegates arriving in stockholm to discuss the planet’s water crisis, has not been lost on some. the charity wateraid is asking people to use recycled water from bathtubs or garden butts or to douse people with sea water.douglas graham, the mnd association’s fundraising director, said: “the backlash is to be expected but, really, this is just a wonderful windfall and we’re so grateful. we didn’t see it coming but, suddenly, the donations just started.” the boost is an enormous help to a small charity looking after sufferers of a debilitating, littleunderstood disease that has no cure and kills five people a day in the uk.former baywatch star pamela anderson, a longstanding animal-rights activist, wrote an open letter to the als association, saying she could not support its record on animal experimentation. a few us stars have rejected the challenge because of california’s drought. actor matt damon got around the problem by pulling up water from his toilets – pointing out that much of the world had less clean drinking water available. actor verne troyer used milk, again citing environmental reasons. and the challenge has been blamed for causing a water shortage on the scottish island of colonsay after its 135 inhabitants picked up on the craze.in australia, a tv anchorman apologized over his robust “no, thanks” response to being nominated. lincoln humphries had said: “instead of pouring fresh water over your own head and wasting ice, here is a list of charities helping communities in desperate need of money across the world. i’d like to nominate everyone, everywhere, who has more than they need, to donate what they can to the people who need it most … because that is what charity is about, not putting yourself through mild discomfort with a bucket of icy water.”another criticism has been that small charities won’t be able to cope with the extra cash, but the mnd association rejected this. “oh, we can cope here,” said graham. “we fund world-class research into the causes and, ultimately, to find a treatment or cure. we provide care and support for 3,500 people and they need it because this is such a rapidly progressing disease and it’s a costly one to manage. over 50% die within two years of diagnosis. it’s heartbreaking to see the decline in people we work with over just a few months.”but, for many people with a connection to the disease, the awareness that the challenge has created is as valuable as the cash. graham says it is priceless. normally, the mnd association gets around 300,000 hits a year on its website. on a single day recently, it had 330,000.“we couldn’t have created this if we’d tried. charities are all worthwhile causes and i understand even that some people might want to donate to a different one. in 2013, british people gave £62bn to charity – we should be proud of that. it’s fabulous for us to get this windfall. we’ll be sitting down over the next few weeks to work out how to spend it in the best way but, i assure you, every penny will count for good.”
