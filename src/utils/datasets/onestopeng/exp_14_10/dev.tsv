intermediate	the uk prime minister, david cameron, has declared a òclear resultó in the scottish independence referendum ð scotland voted by a 10.6-point margin against ending the 307-year- old union with england and wales. the prime minister promised a devolution revolution in great britain, as he welcomed scotlandõs decision to remain inside the uk. òthere can be no disputes, no reruns ð we have heard the will of the scottish people,ó he said in a statement.earlier, scotlandõs  rst minister, alex salmond, remained de ant at a scottish national party rally in edinburgh ð he said he accepted scotland had not, òat this stageó, decided to vote for independence. he said the referendum was a òtriumph for democratic politicsó and he would work with the government in london in the best interests of scotland and the rest of the uk. òwe have touched sections of the community who have never before been touched by politics,ó he said.the yes campaign won four big successes ð it won 53% of the vote in scotlandõs largest city, glasgow, 57% in dundee and 51% in north lanarkshire. however, the no campaign was victorious in 28 authorities. it won easily in areas where it was expected to do well, including edinburgh, aberdeenshire and borders, but also in areas that could have gone to the yes campaign, including the western isles. in the  nal count, the no camp won 2,001,926 votes (55.3%) and the yes camp won 1,617,989 votes (44.7%).in his speech, cameron made clear that there would be constitutional reforms, including in scotland, but not until after the general election. he also said that scottish measures would happen in tandem with changes in england. òwe have heard the voice of scotland and, now, the millions of voices of england must be heard,ó he said.cameron added: òthe people of scotland have spoken and it is a clear result. they have kept our country of four nations together and, like millions of other people, i am delighted. as i said during the campaign, it would have broken my heart to see our united kingdom come to an end. and i know that feeling was shared by people not just across our country but around the world because of what we have achieved together in the past and what we can do together in the future. so, now, it is time for our united kingdom to come together and to move forward. a vital part of that will be a balanced settlement, fair to people in scotland and, importantly, to everyone in england, wales and northern ireland as well.ed miliband, the leader of the labour party, said the referendum was a vote from the scottish people for change. òwe know our country needs to change. we will deliver stronger powers for a stronger scottish parliament, a strong scotland.ó but he said that would go beyond scotland. òwe will also meet the desire for change across england, across wales, across the whole of the united kingdom.ónick clegg, the deputy prime minister, said the referendum was ònot only a new chapter for scotland within the uk but also wider constitutional reform across the unionó. he said a vote against independence was ònot a vote against changeó. òwe must now deliver on time and in full the radical package of newly devolved powers to scotland,ó he added.yet that result raises the risk of further problems ð mps from cameronõs conservative party are threatening to vote against the prime ministerõs promise to quickly increase the scottish parliamentõs powers and protect its spending.the uk independence party leader, nigel farage, said cameronõs offer of more devolution for england did not go far enough. òthe english are 86% by population of this union. theyõve been left out of all of this for the last 18 years. we still have a situation where scottish mps can vote in the house of commons on english-only issues. i think what most english people want is a fair settlement,ó he said. cameron will try to calm tensions when he makes another statement on the result. the prime minister will explain how he will deliver further devolution to scotland, including giving greater powers over tax and welfare to the scottish parliament in edinburgh. the prime minister wants to move fast to show that the three main uk party leaders will meet the commitments they made during the referendum campaign.for the no campaign, there was relief: a number of opinion polls in the  nal days of the campaign had said the vote was on a knife-edge. this brought yes scotland within touching distance of victory after a dramatic surge in support.nannan
intermediate	the atmosphere at the beginning of the final series of downton abbey is one of melancholy and changing times. the year is 1925. the neighbours are selling up their own stately home, while lord grantham wants to cut back on servants.but, at the real downton abbey, highclere castle – a stately home owned by george “geordie” herbert, 8th earl of carnarvon – they have more money than before. according to lady fiona carnarvon, the huge global success of downton has paid for building repairs that are needed to save highclere for the next generation.“it’s been an amazing magic carpet ride for all of us,” she said. “it’s given us free marketing and an international profile. i’m hugely grateful. my husband and i love highclere castle. now, it is loved by millions of other people.”currently, only the ground and first floors of highclere, on the borders of hampshire, are used. but, a restoration project of tower rooms has begun that will eventually allow visitors to climb up into the tower to an exhibition showing the work of the architect of the houses of parliament, sir charles barry, who rebuilt the house between 1839 and 1842.when the downton abbey producers first approached highclere in 2009, the family had £12 million of repairs to do – £1.8 million of that work was urgent. but, by 2012, downton abbey was having a positive effect. lord carnarvon said then: “it was just after the banking crisis and we were worried. then, downton began and highclere became a major tourist attraction.”visitor numbers doubled, to 1,200 a day, as downton abbey, written by julian fellowes, was shown around the world after becoming a hit in the uk in 2010 and, then, in the us. it is now broadcast in 250 countries.there is now a computerized advance booking system, which helps foreign visitors to buy tickets. highclere’s current assets have almost trebled to around £1 million since 2012. gareth neame, the executive producer for the series, said: “i think downton abbey secured highclere’s future.”peter fincham, itv’s director of television, remembers the moment when highclere was booked. “i thought, ‘so what?’, because i had never heard of highclere castle. i thought, ‘every stately home looks the same.’ but i was wrong. the castle has been an enormous character as well.”the downton tourists are part of a growing phenomenon. visitbritain estimates that nearly 30% of foreign visitors, or nearly nine million people, visit castles and historic houses. almost half of visitors to britain now say they want to visit places from films or tv.more than a million take a tour of historic buildings each year, spending more than £1 billion. fifty-one per cent of brazilians, 42% of russians and chinese, and 35% of indian visitors are likely to include a visit to a site of interest in their trips.visitbritain’s director, patricia yates, said: “the links between tourism, films and tv are strong.” she added that period dramas have also increased the popularity of places outside of london.“downton abbey expresses a certain view of britain. it is a fantasy world, based in a particular time in history. it’s the first tv period drama that has really become part of popular culture.”lady carnarvon says that the long-term future of highclere is not necessarily secure. but, she says, “the programme has allowed us to spend faster on the buildings.”highclere castle plans a tutankhamun event in 2022, 100 years after the 5th earl of carnarvon discovered tutankhamun’s tomb with howard carter. another opportunity to keep highclere in the public mind is the 300th anniversary of the birth of lancelot “capability” brown, who designed the grounds.“every single day, don’t take anything for granted,” said lady carnarvon. “you have to invest in all these great houses. and, there has been a deficit since the 1930s. in the past, an estate and house supported the family and their lifestyle but, today, it is quite the reverse: the challenge is how geordie and i can support highclere.“i’ve tried to persuade people it is fun. we have specific events they can engage with, not just a walk around a dusty house. we have to compete with attractions like the london dungeon.”nannan
intermediate	‘fit in four minutes’ sounds like a headline from a health magazine or an impossible promise on late-night satellite tv. then you try dr izumi tabata’s training programme – 20 seconds of allout effort, ten seconds of rest, repeat eight times – and, after collapsing on the floor, you realize you were wrong.tabata has seen it all before. “they were dead!” he laughs as he remembers the first time he tried out his system on his university students in the early 1990s. “after four minutes’ hard exercise they were completely exhausted. but after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised. we all were.”he began his research after he watched japan’s speed skating team in the early 1990s – he noticed that short bursts of incredibly hard exercise seemed to be at least as effective as hours of moderate training. tabata tried to prove this with a simple experiment. one group of moderately trained students did an hour of steady cardiovascular exercise on an exercise bike five times a week. the other group did a ten-minute warm-up on the bike, followed by four minutes of tabata training, four times a week – plus one 30-minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of tabata.the results were very surprising. after six weeks of testing, the group following tabata’s plan – exercising for just 88 minutes a week – had increased their anaerobic capacity by 28% and their vo2 max, something that shows your cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power, by 15%. the control group, who trained for five hours every week, also improved their vo2 max, but by 10% – and their training had no effect on anaerobic capacity.”we also measured increases in heart size after three weeks of doing the exercises,” says tabatabut you have to work very, very hard. you can’t sit on a cross trainer, chewing gum and reading the latest issue of hello! the programme demands intensive bursts on a stationary bike or rowing machine; explosive bodyweight exercises, sprints and so on. remember how you felt after doing a 100m sprint at school? imagine doing eight of them with only a tensecond break to recover.“all-out effort at 170% of your vo2 max is the basis of the programme,” says tabata. “if you feel ok afterwards, you’ve not done it properly. the first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossibly hard. in the original plan the aim was to get to eight, but some only managed six or seven.”one person on an online forum wrote: “when done correctly you should meet god. most people are incapable of doing it correctly and shouldn’t even try.” tabata doesn’t completely agree. “everyone can do it but beginners should start with educated trainers so that they can work at the correct intensity for them,” he explains. he adds that his programme burns an extra 150 calories in the 12 hours after exercise, even at rest. so, although it is used by most people to get fit – or by fit people to get even fitter – it also burns fat.it’s slightly surprising, therefore, that only serious athletes follow the programme at the moment. but that may change now that tabata has agreed a deal that will lead to a network of instructors and a dvd range released towards the end of the year. “i decided to do this because i often go on youtube and, while i am pleased that people are doing it, some are doing it wrong because they don’t realize how hard they need to work,” says tabata.so should we all start following this plan? richard scrivener, a former rugby fitness coach, says that while the benefits are clear, tabatas are an addition, not a replacement, to a favoured sport or training method. “runners, for instance, need a high level of running economy, which comes from learning the skills and running for many miles,” says scrivener, “but they could reduce the number of long runs and the overall mileage by introducing tabata training. this will give joints the chance to rest and recover, especially if you have a history of injuries – and you would probably therefore get more benefit from the long runs when you do them.”gym rats can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three tabatas a week. and the rest of us can slowly increase the number of sessions, although we know that it will never get easier because every session needs maximum effort. that’s the cruel genius of the programme: it is hard – and effective.nannan
intermediate	on one day in august, one in seven people on earth, 1 billion people, used facebook, according to founder mark zuckerberg. in ten years, the social network has completely changed peopleõs relationships, privacy, their businesses, news media, helped to end regimes and even changed the meanings of common words.òa more open and connected world is a better world. it brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society,ó wrote zuckerberg.these are just some of the ways his company changed everything ð for better or worse.1 facebook has changed the de nition of òfriendó òto friendó is now a verb. and, unlike in real life, it is easy to òunfriendó someone, a word invented to describe ending a facebook friendship when that person is no longer improving your facebook newsfeed.although the meanings of the words òshareó and òlikeó are basically the same, facebook has made the terms more important to us.school and university reunions are unnecessary ð you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and youõve seen pictures of your schoolmatesõ babies. you wonõt be surprised to see an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyõre dating someone else from the romantic sel es.but, unlike in real life, on facebook, all your friends have the same importance. a classmate from university who you havenõt seen for 15 years, a friend-of-a-friend from a party or a colleague youõve never actually spoken to in person ð they are all facebook friends in the same way as your closest friend or your spouse or your mum.it doesnõt necessarily mean we see them the same way. professor robin dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have about 150 people as a social group. facebook hasnõt changed that yet, he believes. but dunbar says he fears it is so easy simply to end friendships on facebook that, eventually, people may not need to learn to get on with each other.2 we care less about privacy the surprising thing is that facebook users happily hand over their information.pew research center found that most young people are more than willing to hand over their details. ninety- one per cent post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.but, because so much of a personõs life is shared online, facebook gives people a way to create an image and a fanbase. academics have described a new phenomenon: the òfacebook selfó.more than 80% of facebook users list their interests, which allows brands to target them effectively. but most younger users limit who can see their pro les, with 60% allowing friends only.3 facebook has created millions of jobs ð but not in its own of ces facebook provides indirect employment for people whose job it is to make facebook work for their brand.òit is a tool like no other,ó said michael tinmouth, a social media strategist who has worked with brands such as vodafone and microsoft. òmarketers have an understanding of a brandõs customers like they have never had before. the data available is extraordinary. you know who your customers are, who they are friends with and how they engage with your brand.óand advertisers pay a lot for that. facebook reported advertising revenue had increased by 46%, reaching $3.32bn.facebook is also a mine eld for brands. suddenly, customers donõt simply complain on the phone to a customer service representative or on a small specialist internet forum ð angry customers can post their complaints for hundreds of their friends to see or even on the brandõs own page.4 facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by facebook. manchester universityõs olga onuch found facebook had been the key way for reaching half of all the euromaidan protesters in ukraine. many of the people interviewed in onuchõs research said they relied on facebook for the truth about what was happening ð they donõt trust traditional media.5 facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news about 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63% of users overall, according to the pew research center. about a third of facebook users post about politics and government.most people will  rst read an item of breaking news via facebook or other social media, mostly on mobiles.facebook has also changed the ways journalists write stories. it is a resource many reporters cannot now live without. for better or (often) worse, it is a place to  nd information on almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly  nd themselves at the centre of the dayõs biggest news story.6 users are changing facebook it used to be a site for students of top us universities.in 2014, ten years after its launch, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a facebook account. and 39% are connected to people they have never met in person.more than ever, the site is a gateway not just to your friends but to the rest of the internet.we may as well get used to it, said david kirkpatrick, author of the facebook effect. òit might very well go away further down the road but something this big takes a long time to disappear,ó he told bbc radio 4õs today programme. òfacebook has proven its ability to change and it will continue to be a very, very major player.ónannan

intermediate	chemists have waited a long time for a new element to turn up and, now, four have been discovered by researchers in japan, russia and the us. the four new elements are the first to be added to the periodic table since 2011, when elements 114 and 116 were included. the new elements, all highly radioactive, complete seventh row of the periodic table and mean that science textbooks around the world are now out of date.the us-based international union of pure and applied chemistry (iupac), the global organization that controls chemical names, terminology and measurement, verified the elements on 30 december, 2015 after examining studies dating back to 2004. the scientists who found them must now come up with formal names to replace the latin-based temporary names – ununtrium, ununpentium, ununseptium and ununoctium – which reflect their atomic numbers, 113, 115, 117, and 118. the atomic number is the number of protons found in an element’s atomic nucleus.iupac announced that a russian-american team of scientists at the joint institute for nuclear research in dubna and lawrence livermore national laboratory in california had produced enough evidence to claim the discovery of elements 115, 117 and 118. the organization gave credit for the discovery of element 113, which had also been claimed by the russians and americans, to a team of scientists from the riken institute in japan. the decision means japan becomes the first asian country to name an element. under iupac rules, new elements can be named after mythological concepts, minerals, a place or country, or a scientist.when elements 114 and 116 were given formal names in 2012, scientists chose flerovium and livermorium respectively, after the flerov lab at dubna’s joint institute of research and the lawrence livermore lab in the us, where the elements were discovered. kosuke morita, who led the research at riken, said his team now planned to “look to the uncharted territory of element 119 and beyond”. jan reedijk of iupac, said: “the chemistry community is eager to see the table finally completed down to the seventh row.”the japanese team is considering three names for ununtrium: japonium, rikenium and nishinarium, after the nishina center for accelerator-based science, where the element was found. “they have been thinking about it for a while already,” said polly arnold, professor of chemistry at edinburgh university. “this is painstaking work. the work helps us with our models and with understanding radioactive decay. if we understand it better, hopefully we can improve how we deal with nuclear waste and things that are important in the real world. it also leads to fantastic technological advances in building the kit to make these observations.”along with new names, the scientists must suggest two-letter symbols for the elements. when iupac has received the researchers’ suggestions, they will go to public review for five months. that allows scientists and others to raise any objections. in 1996, the symbol cp was suggested for copernicium, or element 112, but it was changed to cn when scientists complained that cp referred to another substance.to discover the elements, researchers at the three labs slammed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for radioactive decays that should come from the new elements. ununtrium and ununpentium are thought to be metals. ununseptium could be a metalloid. the fourth element, ununoctium, may be a gas, like other elements, helium, neon and argon. it is hard to know for sure because so few atoms of each element have ever been made.paul karol, chair of the iupac panel that verified the elements, said: “it will be a long time before we can find practical uses for the new elements.”
intermediate	it is no longer legal to smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the worldõs drinking capital, new orleans, louisiana. many other cities have banned indoor smoking but new orleans is different ð it attracts tourists with a òlet the good times rolló attitude. an indoor smoking ban in new orleans could have unique consequences.since hurricane katrina in 2005, new orleans city government has begun trying to turn down the volume a bit. with the support of neighbourhood groups, the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly, while, at the same time,  ghting to implement a new ònoise ordinanceó.òthis is just the wrong time for something like this,ó complains bar-owner william walker, who hates the anti-smoking law. òforcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to increase the tension thatõs already there.ómany of new orleansõs best bars and live music venues are in quiet residential neighbourhoods. this neighbourly coexistence is a big part of what makes new orleans different and charming. but, recently, this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of new orleansõs musical personality feels at risk.martha wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music. òi bought the house partly because of the bar so i wonõt ever complain about the noise,ó says wood, who also manages a live-music bar. this bar became one of new orleansõs  rst ever bars legally banned from serving drinks to go, after a series of noise issues in 2013 ð including complaints about the loud smokers outside.the maple leaf club went smoke-free voluntarily in 2014. the same happened at another club where artists had been demanding smoke-free nights. òa lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so i wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesnõt host music,ó says zalia beville, manager of the all ways lounge.luckily, all ways has an outdoor patio, unlike lost love lounge, whose owner, geoff douville, loves the ban ð heõd previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar going. òthereõs no way i could have banned smoking in my bar without a ban throughout the whole city,ó says douville. òpeople act like i have that choice, as a business owner. but, if i make that rule, customers walk down the block to a bar with smoking.ómany small business owners also fear smoke- free revenue loss. smoker neil timms owns an english pub and met the smoking ban before, in england. òback home in england, every pub i knew closed within a year of the smoking ban,ó remembers timms of the ukõs ban, begun in 2007. he doesnõt want his pub to close so heõs spending money to build a patio.but douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity. òthere are lots of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar, with our food, but would never come because they didnõt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days ð weõre now an option for all those people.ó nor does douville worry about noise complaints: òno court is going to say a bar is a ônuisanceõ after the city has rati ed a smoking ban that requires you to go outside!ó he says.councilwoman latoya cantrell, who introduced the ban, disagrees: òthe responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their customers respectful outside as well,ó she says. òthe owners and bartenders need to tell them to go and have a smoke but be respectful to their communities. the idea that we canõt have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous. we can have clean air without noise problems ð i think itõs about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.ócantrell recognizes that the city is different. òhow is new orleans different from the rest of the country? new orleans is known as a place where you can relax and have fun,ó she says. ònew orleans needs to stand up and say ôwe care about our people.õ the most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions are the backbone of our hospitality industry, which drives the economy in the state of louisiana.ómany were worried that the police would not have time to enforce the ban. so the health department   will handle bar warnings and  nes. bar customers are encouraged to ò ll out a form or call 311 and to include photographs of illegal smokingó. for this reason alone, neil timms says heõll comply with the ban: òi donõt want someone to be sitting in the corner smoking and someone takes a photo and gets beaten up.óunworried, geoff douville says that heõs used to noise complaints by now. òyou will see: the nosy neighbours who complain about the noise now are going to be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban.ó in the end, douville shares cantrellõs optimism. òof course theyõre going to complain,ó he accepts. òbut it doesnõt mean theyõre going to win.ó
intermediate	illegal downloading is a kind of “moral squalor” and theft, as much as putting your hand in someone’s pocket and stealing their wallet is theft, says author philip pullman. in an article for index on censorship, pullman, who is president of the society of authors, strongly defends copyright laws. he criticizes internet users who think it is ok to download music or books without paying for them.“the technical brilliance is so dazzling that people can’t see the moral squalor of what they’re doing,” he writes. “it is outrageous that anyone can steal an artist’s work and get away with it. it is theft, just as putting your hand in someone’s pocket and taking their wallet is theft.”his article comes after music industry leaders met british prime minister david cameron in downing street to discuss the issue of web piracy.pullman, writer of the his dark materials trilogy, says authors and musicians work in poverty and obscurity for years to bring their work to the level “that gives delight to their audiences and, as soon as they achieve that, the possibility of earning a living from it is taken away from them”. he concludes: “the principle is simple, and unaltered by technology, science or magic: if we want to enjoy the work that someone does, we should pay for it.”pullman is writing in the next issue of the campaign group’s magazine in a dialogue with cathy casserly, chief executive of creative commons, which offers open content licences “that lets creators take copyright into their own hands”. casserly argues that there is a lot wrong with copyright, which was created “in an analogue age”. she writes: “copyright closes the door on the many ways that people can share, build upon and remix each other’s work, possibilities that were unimaginable when those laws were made.” she says artists need to think creatively about how they distribute and earn money from their work, quoting the science fiction writer cory doctorow, who said: “my problem is not piracy, it’s obscurity.”index on censorship agrees. the magazine’s editor, rachael jolley, said: “existing copyright laws don’t work in the digital age and risk criminalizing consumers. we need new models for how artists, writers and musicians earn a living from their work.”the debate is a lively one and the scale of illegal downloading is enormous. data collected by ofcom (the independent regulator and competition authority for the uk communications industries) suggests that between november 2012 and january 2013 in the uk, 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated, along with 52 million tv shows, 29 million films, 18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files.ofcom says 18% of internet users aged over 12 admit that they have recently pirated content, and 9% say they fear getting caught. pullman writes in his article: “the ease and speed with which music can be acquired in the form of mp3 downloads is still astonishing to those of us who have been building up our itunes list for some time.”following the downing street meeting, cameron appointed the conservative mp mike weatherley to be his adviser on the subject. a spokesman for the bpi, the record industry trade body, said: “mike weatherley is a strong champion of copyright and the artists and creative producers it’s there to protect. we hope his influence and the prime minister’s support for copyright will influence the approach of the uk’s intellectual property office.”nan
intermediate	the problem with google glasses, says takahito iguchi, is that they’re not cool. he may be right. there’s already a website dedicated to people wearing them looking either ridiculous or smug or, more often, both. search google images and one of the first hits is a picture of a large, naked man wearing them in the shower. and it’s this that iguchi, a japanese entrepreneur, hopes may be google’s achilles’ heel. he is launching a competitor that is a bit more stylish. a bit more blade runner. a bit more japanese.iguchi’s augmented reality glasses aren’t really glasses – they are more a single piece of metal with a camera and a tiny projector. they are called telepathy one and, since they were presented to the public for the first time in austin, texas, they have attracted $5m of venture capital. like glass, telepathy one is due to launch in 2014.it’s a simplified version of google glass. glass has a range of uses – you can surf the internet, read emails, take photographs – but telepathy will be “more of a communication device”. connected via bluetooth to your phone, it will focus on real-time visual and audio sharing. you’ll be able to post photos and videos from your line of vision on facebook or send them as an email, or see and speak to a video image of a friend.“it will help bring you close to your friends and family. we are very focused on the communication and sharing possibilities,” says iguchi, who has worked in the japanese technology industry for 20 years.of course, not everyone wants to get closer to the man in the futuristic headset, i tell him. iguchi shakes his head. “i’m a visionary. i have a dream that people will understand other people. when i go to london, i am a stranger. sometimes i feel fear. but i believe that everyone wants to be understood and to understand each other. and, with this device, you can know more information about people before you even speak to them.”compared to google, telepathy is a minnow, but iguchi doesn’t seem to worry. in his shared office space in san francisco – a cool, converted warehouse – he quotes sun tzu’s the art of war and says that even tiny armies can sometimes beat powerful forces. when he was growing up, japanese technology ruled the world: the sony walkman was the iphone of its day. now, to compete, he’s had to leave tokyo and go to silicon valley.“tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture but it’s still an island. it’s isolated. there is not any way to expand. whereas, in silicon valley, everyone is from everywhere. it’s where you come to connect globally.” the hardware will be made in japan, and he is putting together a team of software engineers in the us to develop its applications.building the prototype of telepathy one was easy, iguchi says. “we have every sort of technology in tokyo. it is presenting it to the world that is the challenge.” the top manufacturers all want to work with him, he says, because they have the technology, they just struggle to sell it. “there needs to be a story to the product. like apple did with the ipod – 1,000 songs in your pocket. and steve jobs was inspired by akio morita, the co-founder of sony, and he inspired me, so maybe it will come in a circle.”maybe. he certainly has the confidence of jobs, but, with a thick japanese accent, he sometimes struggles to make himself understood, a fact that may have contributed to his idea for telepathy one. when he went to london to present the headset, he stayed in an airbnb. “the house owner was not my friend but i talked with him for three hours, and now he is my friend. that is how long it takes to understand each other, to share our feelings, and background, and career. maybe telepathy makes that quicker. if you are getting info from the cloud and social networks, that will happen more easily.”iguchi hopes that seeing somebody else’s i suddenly realized that everything is code. everything is coded and is shareable between humans. and everything can be encoded and decoded. and, if code is exchangeable between humans, that will end all war.” literal point of view will help you to see their metaphorical point of view. as a student, he explains, he studied philosophy by day and taught himself how to code by night. “and, one day, i opened the door of my apartment and
elementary	many of us know we donõt get enough sleep but imagine if there was a simple solution: getting up later. in a speech at the british science festival, dr paul kelley from oxford university said schools should stagger their starting times to work with the natural rhythms of their students. this would improve exam results and studentsõ health (lack of sleep can cause diabetes, depression, obesity and other health problems).dr kelley said that, when children are around ten, their natural wake-up time is about 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and, at 18, a personõs natural waking hour is 9am, although you may think they are just a lazy teenager. the normal school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not for 16- to 18-year-olds. for the older teenagers, it might be better to start the school day at 11am or even later. òa 7am wake-up time for older teenagers,ó says kelley, òis the same as a 4.30am start for a teacher in their 50s.óhe says the solution is not to tell teenagers to go to bed earlier. òthe bodyõs natural rhythm is controlled by a particular kind of light,ó says kelley. òthe eye has cells that report to a part of the brain that controls our sleep rhythms over a 24-hour cycle. itõs the light that controls it.óbut it isnõt just students who would bene t from a later start. kelley says the working day should be more linked to our natural rhythms. describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: òbetween 14 and 24, people lose more than two hours. for people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35, they lose about an hour and a half. that can continue up until youõre about 55 when itõs in balance again. the 10-year-old and 55-year-old wake and sleep naturally at the same time.óso, should workplaces have staggered starting times, too? should people in their 50s and above come in at 8am, people in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage apprentice at 11am? kelley says that synchronized hours could have òmany positive effects. the positive side is that peopleõs performance, mood and health will improve. itõs very positive because itõs a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.óthere would probably be fewer accidents because drivers would be more awake, he says. it could mean the end of rush hour because people would stagger their work times and the times of their school run. a later start to the day for many, says kelley, òis something that would bene t all people, particularly families. parents go and try to wake up teenagers who are waking up three hours too early. it creates problems for everybody.óso, what time does kelley start work? òi am 67 so that means iõm like a 10-year-old and i get up just after six. i wake naturally.ó and, yes, he says he  nds the start of his working day much easier now than when he was younger.
elementary	the small room looks like a classroom. the posters on the walls show letters of the alphabet and a map of bangladesh.but, it is hard to concentrate – there is the loud hammering and chemicals in the air that hurt the throat and eyes. but, the children who learn in this three-square-metre room are lucky. they have escaped working in the factories opposite.for 14 years, sohay, a non-governmental organization (ngo), has worked in slums in dhaka to send child workers to school. it especially tries to help children who do dangerous work.the classroom is one of 23 centres that sohay has set up in dhaka. the classes at the centres help children enter primary school. when they are in school, the children get extra help with their homework at the centres.alamin, ten years old, used to work in a plastic factory. he now goes to one of the centres. his parents are happy that he’s now in school and not doing dangerous work. his friend rabi says he wants to forget his past in the factory. “i like school,” he says.sohay also has classes for parents and managers to stop child labour. it can be very difficult for working children to go to school. they are not like other children. after they stop working, they sometimes find it difficult to make friends and adapt to school. it is also difficult to make sure they stay in school – lots of these children don’t finish school.seven-year-old zhorna akter sumayya has two older brothers – they both work (one at a restaurant, one at a local club). but, she went to a sohay centre and she now goes to school. her family live in the slum and her parents need the money their sons make but they want their daughter to go to school.in 2015, sohay helped 1,540 children to leave dangerous work and helped 2,125 more children – those who would soon start work – to go to school. about 780 more children are preparing to start school in 2017.the labour law of bangladesh 2006 does not allow children younger than 14 to work but unicef says that, in bangladesh, 4.7 million children younger than 14 are employed and 1.3 million children aged five to 17 do dangerous work.nannannannannannan
elementary	the international monetary fund (imf) has asked the usa to manage its money better. hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work after the government shut down for 16 days.us president barack obama said that the us has to be more careful with how it manages its money. the imf’s managing director, christine lagarde, asked for more stability.the senate wrote a peace deal, which included almost nothing that the conservatives asked for. the conservative republicans nearly caused a new financial crisis because they did not agree to obama’s healthcare reforms. the house of representatives agreed the deal at the last minute.the world bank was also pleased that the world’s economy had “avoided a catastrophe”. its president, jim yong kim, asked politicians in all countries to continue to make policies that improve the economy and give jobs and opportunity to all.the shutdown cost the us $24 billion.obama signed the legislation shortly after midnight on thursday. the bill passed easily, with support from all parties in the senate, where democratic and republican leaders wrote the agreement. it is a temporary solution. it gives the government money until 15 january and allows the government to borrow more money if they want to until 7 february.but the president made clear that he did not expect another serious budget fight and shutdown in 2014.at the white house, obama said he hoped the deal would “lift the cloud of uncertainty” that had hung over the country in recent weeks.“when this agreement arrives on my desk, i will sign it immediately,” he said. “hopefully, next time, it won’t be in the eleventh hour. we must manage our money better.”a journalist asked the president if the crisis would happen again in a few months. obama replied: “no.”earlier, the republican senator mike lee said there would be more trouble: “the media keeps asking: ‘was it worth it?’ my answer is, it is always worth it to do the right thing.” he added: “this is not over.”but the political deal on wednesday was one of the worst of all possible results for republicans. they did not achieve any of their goals and most people blamed them for the crisis.nannannan
elementary	not many exercise classes have a tea break in the middle. but margaret allen’s class has one. after a gentle warm-up and a few quick exercises, the 93-year-old great-grandmother lets her group sit down and relax with a cup of tea. some of the eight people in the class look like they need a break, but allen is not even sweating.the general rule is that eating just before doing sport is not a good idea and especially not halfway through the class. but, on the afternoon i visit allen’s class in saltburnby- the-sea, they eat fruitcake during the break. the cake was made for allen’s recent birthday by her 89-year-old sister, joan.the ladies have just finished their cake when allen gets up again. she plays a lively scottish song and there is lots of toe pointing and leg kicking. forty-five minutes later, the class is finally over.allen has been leading classes in the north-east town for 45 years. she wasn’t very sporty at school, but she started playing the piano for a keep-fit class during the second world war and started leading the class in her 40s when the old instructor retired.at one time, allen’s class had more than 18 regulars, each paying £1 a time. but, these days, the group is getting smaller. during the tea break, the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them went to that week for one of the younger people in the group who died recently, aged 68.allen is the oldest, her sister the second oldest. the baby of the group is 60-year-old jean cunion, who is a bit embarrassed to say that she is perhaps the least fit of the group. “i remember, the first time i came, margaret said, ‘who’s that breathing heavily?’ and i had to say it was me.” ruth steere, 76, says allen always has her back to the class, but she always knows what’s happening: “she always shouts at us if we go wrong. she’s very good at knowing what we are doing.”allen, who loves dancing, has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor. instead, she got ideas for her own moves from five fitness videos from the bbc. allen thinks she is healthy because she keeps busy, especially since her husband died in 1997. she started writing poetry when she was 80.“i write poems about everything. i just can’t stop,” she says, when she phones me a few days after the interview to read out a poem she has written about the joys of exercise. she still plays the piano and gives speeches. she also did a computer course when she was 88.ageing is no fun, she says. she reads me a few lines from a poem she has written called ‘that beast called age’. she happily remembers a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years ago, who said he didn’t believe she was more than 78: “i said, ‘thank you, doctor. you can go now.’”she also has a practical idea for people who are overweight: “i just think people shouldn’t eat too much. when i hear someone say, ‘oh, i can’t lose weight’, i say: ‘sellotape.’” she mimes taping her mouth shut. “i said this the other day to a big fat man. everything in moderation is my motto.”earlier in 2013, allen was watching the news and saw a woman get the british empire medal. “the woman said: ‘i’m 80 and i’m the oldest fitness instructor in the country!’ i thought: ‘no, you’re not.’” but allen won’t write to the queen to complain.nannan
elementary	the last time she performed, we did not have mobile phones. now, 35 years later, as she performs again, singer kate bush sees a very different world.these days, most concerts are now lit up with phones and tablets, but bush does not want her fans to watch her shows through a screen.in august, before her concerts at the hammersmith apollo in london, bush asked her fans to put down their mobile phones at her gigs.bush wrote on her website: “i have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows. we have chosen a theatre, not a large venue or stadium. please do not take photos or videos during the shows.“i very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iphones, ipads or cameras.”bush is not the first singer or musician to say she doesn’t like phones at concerts. roger daltrey from the who recently said it was “weird” that people looked at their screen and not the artist on stage.he said: “i feel sorry for them, i really feel sorry for them. looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally – if you’re doing that, you’re 50% there, right? it’s weird.”in 2013, beyoncé told a fan, “you can’t even sing because you’re too busy filming. put that damn camera down!”recently, dutch football fans at psv eindhoven protested against the introduction of wi-fi in their stadium. they held up banners that said “no wi-fi. support the team,” and “you can sit at home.” manchester united have also told fans to leave their “large electronic devices” at home.singer jarvis cocker said, “it seems stupid to have something happening in front of you and look at it on a screen that’s smaller than a cigarette packet.”even in the world of classical music, one of the world’s top pianists surprised the audience in june 2013 when he left the stage because a fan was filming his performance on a smartphone. krystian zimerman returned moments later and said: “the destruction of music because of youtube is enormous.”but sam watt says that filming at concerts makes the experience even better. he works for vyclone, a phone app that puts together many videos uploaded by fans to create one long video of a show.“fans filming is now part of the concert experience – that is a just a fact. we take the videos that people are filming at concerts and mix them together with everybody else who was filming. the result is a really fantastic video,” he said.“we think that filming at concerts adds to the experience, and i think that, if kate bush came round for a cup of tea, we could have a really interesting discussion about this,” he added. “people are going to film and they want those memories – you’ve got to accept it.”nannannannannannan
elementary	mcdonaldõs is the worldõs biggest burger chain and a symbol of american consumer capitalism. but, these days, the golden arches of mcdonaldõs are not looking so golden. the company has got much bigger since 2003 but, now, the numbers of customers are falling. mcdonaldõs says that its worldwide sales have fallen by 3.3%.the company has problems almost everywhere. in china, sales fell by 23%. in europe, sales fell by 4%, mostly because of problems in ukraine and the anti-western mood in russia. health inspectors have investigated around 200 of mcdonaldõs 450 restaurants in russia and they have closed ten restaurants.but the worst crisis is in the us, where mcdonaldõs has around 40% of its restaurants. almost 60 years since ray kroc opened his  rst restaurant in des plaines, illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a big mac and fries. sales have fallen every month for 12 months in the us. many younger diners are eating at rival companies such as chipotle mexican grill. the number of 19-to-21-year-olds who visit mcdonaldõs once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011.another problem is that mcdonaldõs hamburgers were recently named the worst in america in a poll of more than 32,000 american diners ð they said they would rather eat a burger at five guys, smashburger or fuddruckers. many people also believe that mcdonaldõs is less healthy than most of its rivals, especially chipotle. chipotle uses antibiotic-free meat and òlocally sourced, seasonaló ingredients.mcdonaldõs asked customers for their opinions in the us in october. someone asked òhave you ever used pink slime in your burgers?ó ð ôpink slimeõ is the beef  ller that is used for dog food. mcdonaldõs stopped using this meat product in 2012 but mcdonaldõs chief executive don thompson said the company still had to improve peopleõs opinions about the freshness and quality of its ingredients.mcdonaldõs has always had a reputation for fast service at low prices. but, since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, people think it is more expensive than its rivals and many consumers complain that service is slower.but mary chapman at food analysts technomic said that it wasnõt fair to say that mcdonaldõs was more expensive than its rivals. òprices have gone up but they havenõt gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-food chains in the us.ó prices at mcdonaldõs have increased by 4.8% since 2009, much less than the fast-food average (up 19.4%).but people are right when they complain that the queues are longer. mcdonaldõs has a bigger menu than some other restaurants, with more complicated items ð its chicken mcwrap takes 60 seconds to make. òi think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not,ó said chapman.mcdonald managers are promising to improve peopleõs opinions about its food in the us. thompson has promised more organic food and òbuild your own burgersó. but, to reduce queues, he also wants to introduce simpler menus. how can the company have simpler menus and, at the same time, a larger selection of  llings? òthey want to simplify the menu but also offer ôbuild your own burgersõ ð that sounds tricky,ó said consumer expert mark kalinowski. only four out of mcdonaldõs 14,000 us restaurants have tested òbuild your own burgeró, he said. òright now, we are sceptical; we would like to see more detail.ósales are falling but mcdonaldõs continues to expand around the world: by the end of 2014, it expects to open 1,400 new restaurants. kalinowski thinks that mcdonaldõs sales will continue to fall but he thinks it will be number one for many years.nannannan
elementary	people today might not hear the sounds of the natural world because they screen out the noises around them, says a us researcher.more background noise can make people oblivious to the uplifting sounds of birdsong, water and trees in the wind. you can often hear these sounds even in cities, said kurt fristrup, a senior scientist at the us national park service.the problem is even worse because people listen to music through their earphones instead of listening to the birds and other sounds of nature. natural sounds are easily drowned out by traf c, music and others noises, fristrup said.òthis learned deafness is a real problem,ó fristrup told the american association for the advancement of science meeting in san jose. òwe are training ourselves to ignore the information that comes into our ears.òthis gift that we are born with ð the ability to hear things hundreds of metres away, all these incredible sounds ð might be lost,ó he said.this is the problem: we hear so many noises that we stop listening.for the past ten years, the us national park service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 parks in the us, including yosemite in california, yellowstone and denali in alaska. there was noise from human activity in all the parks, for example aircraft, motorbikes, motorboats and tour buses.fristrupõs team say that noise pollution more than doubles every 30 years. òitõs not surprising people put on earphones,ó he said.òmore background noise has the same effect on your hearing as fog has on your vision ð you are aware of only a small area around you,ó he said. even in our cities, there are birds and things to appreciate in the environment but we are losing the ability to hear them.people quickly become used to changes in their environments, including more noise. fristrup worries that we will forget how much quieter the world could be. òif  nding peace and quiet becomes too dif cult, many children will grow up without the experience and i think itõs a very big problem,ó he said.other scientists reported health bene ts from listening to natural sounds. speaking at the same meeting, derrick taff, a social scientist at pennsylvania state university, said that listening to recordings from national parks, of waterfalls, birdsong and wind, helped people feel less stressed.òwe know that natural sounds are very important to people. they are some of the main reasons people visit protected areas. they want to hear the natural quiet, the birdsong, and the wind and water,ó taff said. òwe may be losing this as people are listening to their ipods all the time. my advice is to go to your protected areas and experience what you are missing.ónannannan
elementary	more than one million british workers might be employed on zero-hours contracts. this number comes from a poll of more than 1,000 employers by the chartered institute of personnel and development (cipd).recently, some uk organizations ð from shops to buckingham palace ð have been criticized for employing staff without a guarantee of work and pay each week. employees on zero-hours contracts often get no holiday or sick pay and have to ask permission before looking for extra work with another company.the cipd found that 38% of zero-hours contract workers describe themselves as employed full-time. they say they typically work 30 hours or more a week. one-third of voluntary sector employers use the contracts and one in four public sector organizations.the retail company sports direct employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on zero-hours contracts. other companies using the contracts include cinema chain cineworld and buckingham palace, which uses the contracts for its 350 summer workers. pub group j d wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff ð 80% of its workforce ð on zero-hours contracts.vidhya alakeson, from the resolution foundation, said: òif itõs true that there are around one million people on zero-hours contracts, then that would be a big part of the workforce.óunions say that employers put pressure on staff to sign the contracts. in this way, the employers can avoid their responsibilities to employees and reduce staff bene ts.dave prentis, of the trade union unison, said: òthe majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice.óworkers on zero-hours contracts are often only told how many hours they will work when weekly or monthly rotas are created. but they have to be available for extra work at short notice. they may get holiday pay, but they do not get sick pay.the charity national trust, which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts, said it gives the same pay and bene ts to workers on zero-hours contracts as to full-time staff.òwe believe zero-hours contracts are essential in our organization, because we are very weather-dependent,ó the national trust said. òitõs important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.ópolitician chuka umunna said, òwhile some employees welcome the  exibility of zero-hours contracts, for many, zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come,ó he said.the poll shows that 17% of employers in the private sector use zero-hours contracts, lower than the 34% of organizations in the voluntary sector and 24% in the public sector.industries where employers were most likely to have at least one person on a zero-hours contract were hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).nannannannan
elementary	water scientists have given a very strong warning about the world’s food supplies. they say that everyone may have to change to a vegetarian diet by 2050.we believe there will be an extra two billion people in the world by 2050. humans get about 20% of their protein from animal-based products now, but this may need to decrease to just 5% to feed these extra people, say the world’s top water scientists.“there will not be enough water to produce food for the nine-billion population in 2050 if more people start eating like people in the west,” the report by malik falkenmark and colleagues at the stockholm international water institute (siwi) said.“there will be enough water if the percentage of animal-based foods is limited to 5% of total calories.”there are warnings that water shortages will limit food production. at the same time, oxfam and the un prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years. prices for food items such as corn and wheat have increased nearly 50% on international markets since june. the price increase has been caused by very bad droughts in the us and russia, and weak monsoon rains in asia. more than 18 million people already have serious food shortages across the sahel.oxfam says that the effects of price increases will be very bad in developing countries that need to buy food from other countries, including parts of latin america, north africa and the middle east. food shortages in 2008 led to fighting in 28 countries.changing to a vegetarian diet is one way to keep more water to grow food, the scientists said. animal protein-rich food uses five to ten times more water than vegetarian food. one third of the world’s farmland is used to grow crops to feed animals.“nine hundred million people already don’t have enough food and two million people are malnourished, even though we are producing more food,” they said. “70% of all water is used in farming, and growing more food to feed an extra two billion people by 2050 will put more pressure on water and land.”the report was released at the start of the annual world water conference in stockholm, sweden, where 2,500 politicians, un groups, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries met to discuss global water supply problems.eating too much, malnourishment and waste are all increasing. “we will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future,” said the report’s editor, anders jägerskog.nannannannannan
elementary	a group of experts say that thousands of people are taking unnecessary medicines and have bad diets because of bogus allergy tests. allergies and food intolerances are increasing very quickly but people do not understand the difference between an allergy and a food intolerance – this is causing problems, says the charity sense about science, who have written a guide to allergies.“it’s a big mess,” said tracey brown, director of sense about science. “there is unnecessary action for people who don’t really have allergies and not enough action for people who have allergies.”lots of people tell the waiter or waitress in a restaurant that they have an allergy. but some of these people don’t have an allergy – that have a food intolerance, which is not dangerous. experts fear that restaurants hear so many people say that they have allergies (when maybe that is not true) that they may not be careful enough when they give food to a person who has a real allergy.“it matters very much,” said moira austin of an allergy charity. “if a restaurant thinks somebody just doesn’t want to eat a food because it makes them feel uncomfortable, the restaurant may be less careful. there have been deaths where people have gone to a restaurant, told the waiter or waitress that they have an allergy to a food and the meal has been given to them containing that food.”the guide says most allergy tests bought on the internet or in shops do not work. they include a test people can use at home, which looks for specific antibodies against different foods in the blood. these antibodies are part of the body’s response to infections but “the best medical evidence has shown high antibody levels do not suggest an allergy”, the guide says. the test often shows people have an allergy or a food intolerance when this is not true.another test also does not work. it uses a mixture of acupuncture and homeopathy. testing hair is also pointless, the guide says. “hair cannot show if you are allergic or not so testing hair cannot give any useful information on allergies.”“i often see children who are on very limited diets – their parents believe that they have allergies because they have taken ‘allergy tests’ that do not work,” said paul seddon, an allergy doctor for children. “this needs to stop, which can only happen if we prove these ‘tests’ do not work.”allergies can cause tiredness, headaches and eczema in children. but you need to check if they have an allergy and this takes a long time and many tests. it may seem like a good idea to do just one test and get a quick answer. but, it will be a wrong answer.allergies are increasing in developed countries. there are three times more children with certain allergies now compared to 30 years ago. the sense about science guide lists a number of myths about the sources of allergies, for example the myths that fast food or e numbers in food colourings cause allergies.nan
advanced	not just the identity of the man in the car park with the twisted spine, but the appalling last moments and humiliating treatment of the naked body of richard iii in the hours after his death have been revealed at an extraordinary press conference at leicester university.there were cheers when richard buckley, lead archaeologist on the hunt for the king’s body, finally announced that the university team was convinced “beyond reasonable doubt” that it had found the last plantagenet king, bent by scoliosis of the spine, and twisted further to fit into a hastily dug hole in grey friars church, which was slightly too small to hold his body.but, by then, it was clear the evidence was overwhelming, as the scientists who carried out the dna tests, those who created the computer-imaging technology to peer onto and into the bones in extraordinary detail, the genealogists who found a distant descendant with matching dna, and the academics who scoured contemporary texts for accounts of the king’s death and burial outlined their findings.“what a morning. what a story,” said philippa langley, of the richard iii society. she had been driving on the project for years, in the face of incredulity from many people, and finding funds from all over the world when it looked as if the money would run out before the excavation had even begun.work has started on designing a new tomb in leicester cathedral, only 100 yards from the excavation site, and a ceremony will be held to lay him into his new grave there, probably next year. leicester’s museums’ service is working on plans for a new visitor centre in an old school building overlooking the site.richard died at bosworth on 22 august 1485, the last english king to fall in battle, and the researchers revealed how for the first time. there was an audible intake of breath as a slide came up showing the base of his skull sliced off by one terrible blow, believed to be from a halberd, a fearsome medieval battle weapon with a razor-sharp iron axe blade weighing about two kilos, mounted on a wooden pole, which was swung at richard at very close range. the blade probably penetrated several centimetres into his brain and, said the human bones expert jo appleby, he would have been unconscious at once and dead almost as soon.the injury appears to confirm contemporary accounts that he died in close combat in the thick of the battle and unhorsed – as in the great despairing cry shakespeare gives him: “a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!” another sword slash, which also went through the bone and into the brain, would also have proved fatal. but many of the other injuries were after death, suggesting a gruesome ritual on the battlefield and as the king’s body was brought back to leicester, as he was stripped, mocked and mutilated.one terrible injury, a stab through the right buttock and into his pelvis, was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour. it suggests the story that his naked corpse was brought back slung over a horse, mocked and abused all the way, is true. bob savage, a medieval arms expert from the royal armouries who helped identify the wounds, said it was probably not a war weapon but the sort of sharp knife or dagger any workman might have carried.michael ibsen, the canadian-born furniture maker proved to be the descendant of richard’s sister, heard the confirmation on sunday and listened to the unfolding evidence in shocked silence. “my head is no clearer now than when i first heard the news,” he said. “many, many hundreds of people died on that field that day. he was a king, but just one of the dead. he lived in very violent times and these deaths would not have been pretty or quick.”it was mathew morris who first uncovered the body, in the first hour of the first day of the excavation. he did not believe he had found the king. the mechanical digger was still chewing the tarmac off the council car park, identified by years of research by local historians and the richard iii society as the probable site of the lost church of grey friars, whose priests bravely claimed the body of the king and buried him in a hastily dug grave, probably still naked, but in a position of honour near the high altar of their church. the leg bones just showing through the soil were covered up again.ten days later, on 5 september, when further excavation proved morris had hit the crucial spot, he returned with lin foxhall, head of the archaeology department, to excavate the body. “we did it the usual way, lifting the arms, legs and skull first, and proceeding gradually towards the torso – so it was only when we finally saw the twisted spine that i thought: ‘my word, i think we’ve got him.’”as far as langley is concerned, richard was the true king, the last king of the north, a worthy and brave leader who became a victim of some of the most brilliant propaganda in history, in the hands of the tudors’ imagemaker, shakespeare. there remains the dark shadow of the little princes in the tower, an infamous story even in richard’s day: the child edward v and his brother richard were declared illegitimate when richard iii claimed the throne, imprisoned in the tower of london and never seen alive again. although it is by no means certain that the bones found at the tower centuries later are theirs, there may be more dna detective work to be done there.
advanced	he is not the first person to express scepticism about mars one, a vastly ambitious private mission aiming to settle humans on mars from 2025. but joseph roche is different from most critics: he’s on the shortlist of astronauts.roche, an astrophysicist at trinity college dublin who was announced in february as among the 100 people in line for the mission, has written for the guardian expressing his grave doubts about the viability of mars one.the selection process, roche writes, “was not rigorous enough to reach the requisite standard of more traditional astronaut selection programmes”. he also says the dutch mars one team have displayed “a certain naivety” in believing they can succeed alone in the supposed $6bn mission and should now accept it is very unlikely to happen.he writes: “more openness and transparency would benefit mars one greatly but i think that the shortcomings of the selection process, coupled with their unwillingness to engage and collaborate with the scientific community mean that the time might have come for mars one to acknowledge the implausibility of this particular venture and turn their efforts towards supporting other exciting and more viable upcoming space missions.”roche also expressed worries about the way the mission organizers publicized a so-called top-ten candidates. the ranking, he said, didn’t mean these were the most likely potential astronauts but was, instead, based on how many “supporter points” each had earned through acts such as buying official merchandise.he writes: “these points are mars one’s supporter points which ‘represent the degree of your support to mars one’s mission’.” these points play no role in the selection process and serve only to show how much each supporter has donated to mars one.”the official timeline for the mission says the group plans to dispatch a stationary lander and satellite to mars in 2018, followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022. humans would start arriving in 2025 and crews of four would be sent every two years to add to the settlement. they would not return to earth.in february, a prominent supporter of the project, gerard ’t hooft, a dutch nobel laureate in physics, said he did not believe this timetable was realistic. he said: “it will take quite a bit longer and be quite a bit more expensive. when they first asked me to be involved, i told them: ‘you have to put a zero after everything’.”roche also spoke to medium, a us blogging platform that has previously expressed grave sceptism about mars one, reporting among other things that the supposed 200,000 applications to be astronauts in fact totalled 2,761.he told medium about the selection process in more detail: “i have not met anyone from mars one in person. initially, they’d said there were going to be regional interviews; we would travel there, we’d be interviewed, we’d be tested over several days and, in my mind, that sounded at least like something that approached a legitimate astronaut selection process.“but then they made us sign a non-disclosure agreement if we wanted to be interviewed and then, all of a sudden, it changed from being a proper regional interview over several days to being a ten-minute skype call.”roche told the guardian he did not want to give more interviews as he was wary about being negative about the idea of space travel.in his comment piece he writes: “i am passionate about pushing the boundaries of scientific endeavour and that is why the ambitiousness of the mars one plan appealed to me. although mars one were never likely to overcome the financial and technical barriers during their proposed timeline, it was refreshing to hear a new idea that challenges us to think about our own role in the future of space exploration.“being part of the subsequent public debate over the ethics and morality of future missions has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable aspects of my candidacy with mars one. if a one-way mission to mars ever became possible, then i would always volunteer. for an astrophysicist, that is not a difficult decision to make but it is also a moot point because i do not think we will see a one-way mission in my lifetime.”
advanced	jmw turner, one of britain’s greatest painters, is to be the face of the new £20 note, following a nationwide vote.it will be the first time an artist has appeared on a british banknote, after the governor of the bank of england, mark carney, asked the public to nominate a deceased cultural figure they felt deserved the high honour.turner, renowned for his dramatic seascapes, beat off competition from 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, film-makers and actors put forward by 30,000 members of the public.the list included alfred hitchcock, alexander mcqueen, derek jarman, laura ashley, william morris and vanessa bell, which was then narrowed down by a panel of artists, critics and historians to a final choice of five.the final five – barbara hepworth, charlie chaplin, josiah wedgwood, william hogarth and turner – were selected on the basis of their “unquestioned” contribution to both the visual arts and british society as a whole, as well as their enduring influence.fittingly, the announcement of the new banknote was made at the turner contemporary gallery in margate, which stands on the former site of mrs booth’s lodging house, where turner would always stay when he visited. the announcement was made jointly by carney and the artist tracey emin, who grew up in the town.carney said it had been “so important to get this right and have a proper process that involved the public,” adding that, far from banknotes being purely a practical necessity, “if done properly, they can be a piece of art in everyone’s pocket”.“money is memory for a country and its people,” said the bank of england governor. “banknotes of the bank of england are a celebration of the uk’s heritage, a salute to its culture, a testament to its great achievements, including those of its most notable citizens. in short, money has not just economic value, it has cultural value as well.“the fact that we will have turner on the £20 note shows now that the british people are a nation of people who appreciate creativity and appreciate the arts,” said emin.the note will feature turner’s 1799 self-portrait, which currently hangs in tate britain, as well as one of his most recognizable works, the fighting temeraire, a tribute to the ship that played a distinguished role in nelson’s victory at the battle of trafalgar in 1805.emblazoned on the note will also be a quote from the artist – “light is therefore colour” – as well as his signature, taken from his will, in which he bequeathed many of his works to the nation.the new £20 note, which replaces the one featuring social philosopher and economic theorist adam smith, will enter circulation by 2020. this is the first time the public have been given a say over whose face appears on a british banknote.carney overhauled the process in 2013, following a high-profile campaign to ensure that women, apart from the queen, remained on banknotes, after the bank decided to phase out the elizabeth fry £5 note.historical figures were first introduced onto banknotes in 1970. turner joins winston churchill and jane austen as the significant figures who will feature on the new polymer notes – a plastic-type material that the new notes will all be made from – churchill on the £5 and austen on the £10 note. following in the footsteps of florence nightingale and elizabeth fry, the pride and prejudice author is only the third woman to be the face of british currency.turner was born in 1775 in london, the son of a barber, and he entered the royal academy schools at the age of 14. it was 1786, when he was sent to margate, that his love affair with painting and drawing the north-east kent coast began. he would return to that coast throughout his life and it was where he painted some of his most dramatic oils and watercolours, describing its skies as “the loveliest in all europe”.turner was a particularly prolific artist, producing more than 550 oil paintings and 2,000 watercolours over his lifetime. his life was also the subject of a film, in 2014, by mike leigh, with timothy spall taking on the role of the complex artist.victoria pomery, the director of turner contemporary, said: “the decision to celebrate jmw turner, one of the greatest technical pioneers in the history of british art, is extraordinary, not least because it has proven by a public vote that turner is the nation’s favourite artist. brilliantly, it is an official acknowledgment of the immense historical value of the visual arts to the uk.“but it is also a stark reminder that we must place increasing value on our future as a nation of creative minds. we must invest to support the next great artists and innovators.”
advanced	tigers are more numerous in nepal than at any time since the 1970s, a new census has revealed, giving conservationists hope that the big cats, whose numbers have been dropping across south asia for 100 years, can be saved.the number of wild royal bengal tigers in nepal has increased to 198 – a 63.6% rise in five years – the government survey showed. “this is very encouraging,” said maheshwar dhakal, an ecologist with nepal’s department of national parks and wildlife conservation.the census is based on the examination of pictures from more than 500 cameras placed in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors. more than 250 conservationists and wildlife experts worked on the survey, which cost about £250,000. dhakal said that a parallel survey was conducted in india and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013. “it will take a few more months for india, which now has 1,300 big cats in several huge protected areas, to finalize the data,” he added. nepal has pledged to double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 when the last systematic tiger count took place.increasing prosperity in asia has pushed up prices for tiger skins and the body parts used in traditional chinese medicines. international gangs pay poor local nepali significant sums to kill the cats. the skin and bones are handed to middlemen, who pass easily through the porous border to india, where the major dealers are based.one major problem is complicity between senior officials and mafia networks involved in the trade. conservation experts credit the increase in numbers to the effective policing of national parks, stronger anti-poaching drives and better management of tiger habitats in nepal, where forests cover 29% of the land. but they say nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers prey so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat.as the number of tigers has increased over the years, so have incidents of conflict with villagers. seven people were killed in attacks by tigers around national parks in 2012 compared to four in 2011, park officials said. villagers are also seeking better protection. “the government is making conservation plans for tigers. but it should also come up with plans to protect people from tigers,” krishna bhurtel, a local village headman in chitwan, told nepali newspaper nagarik. wildlife authorities captured a tiger in chitwan after it killed two people, including a villager who was pulled from his bed in may.thousands of tigers once roamed the forests in bangladesh, india and nepal. but their numbers have dropped to about 3,000, a 95% drop over a century. chitwan national park in central nepal has the highest number of adult tigers, with 120, followed by bardiya national park (50) and shukla phanta wildlife reserve (17).diwakar chapagain, who heads a world wildlife fund nepal unit that monitors wildlife trade, said tiger skins were in demand in tibet, where well-heeled people use them as festival costumes.in nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins in front of stuffed tigers for special occasions. some affluent nepali have mounted tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms. tiger bones are in high demand for use in traditional chinese medicines. “the trade in tiger parts is lucrative and fetches thousands of dollars in illegal markets,” chapagain said, highlighting the threat tigers face.
advanced	our new international survey across 33 countries shows just how wrong the world is about a range of key social realities.british people think the top 1% wealthiest households own 59% of their countryõs wealth, when they actually òonlyó own 23%. americans think that 33% of their population are immigrants, when in fact it is only 14%.brazilians think the average age in their country is 56, when it is only 31. russians think that 31% of their politicians are women, when it is only 14%.in britain, people think that an extraordinary 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%. in india, the online population think 60% of the whole country also has internet access, when in fact only 19% do.why are people across the world so often so clueless about these realities?it is partly that we just struggle with basic maths and some of us clearly misunderstand the questions or interpret them differently. for example, most countries hugely overestimate how many people do not af liate themselves with a religion: across the 33 countries, 37% do not, according to respondents, but the average is actually just 18%. this will be partly because we will be thinking of how many people practise their religion, rather than what they put on census forms. people also take mental shortcuts, where they grab for easily available information even if it doesnõt quite  t the question. our huge overestimates of the rural populations in most countries will be affected by how much of the physical landmass rural areas make up, rather than a careful calculation of how unoccupied it generally is. in daniel kahnemanõs terms, answers to these sorts of questions are classic examples of òfastó thinking, rather than òslowó.we are tied to our own perspective and struggle to imagine the variety in our countries, as highlighted by our indian sampleõs massively overestimating their populationõs access to the internet. our study was mostly carried out through an online survey ð and, in developing countries, this will be representative of a more af uent, connected group rather than the population as a whole. in some ways, we may have expected this more educated sample to get closer to reality ð those with higher education levels tend to be more accurate on these types of questions. but what we  nd, throughout the study, is that people grossly generalize from their own situations, forgetting how unrepresentative they are.we suffer from what social psychologists call òemotional innumeracyó when estimating realities: this means we are sending a message about what is worrying us as much as trying to get the right answers. cause and effect run both ways, with our concern leading to our misperceptions as much as our misperceptions creating our concern.for britain, this is likely to be part of the explanation for peopleõs huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own, how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when it is really only 13%, according to of cial estimates). people are worried about the concentration of wealth, the housing pressures facing young people and immigration levels, and this is re ected in them overstating the scale of the issues. but, the survey suggests there are also some issues where people are not as worried as they should be. for example, most countries hugely underestimate how much of their population is overweight or obese. the worst case is saudi arabia, where people think only 28% are, when 71% are. britons think it is 44%, when it is actually nearly half as much again ð 62% are either overweight or obese.and, in many ways, it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study. the top 1% in russia own 70% of the nationõs wealth, while the top 1% in new zealand only own 18%. half of italians aged 25-34 still live with their parents, when it is only 4% in norway. the average age in india is 27; it is 47 in japan. only 10% of politicians are women in brazil, hungary and japan, when 44% are in sweden. when the reality is so strange and varied, it is no wonder weõre so wrong.
advanced	an international agreement to improve safety in bangladesh’s clothing factories is facing the threat of legal action as factory owners demand compensation for the cost of closures and repair work. with some repair programmes expected to take months, factory owners say they cannot shoulder the costs of paying staff while factories are closed, alongside the expense of some major works needed to ensure buildings are safe. the building overhauls are being carried out in the wake of the collapse of the rana plaza complex in the capital of bangladesh, dhaka, in 2013, in which 1,138 people were killed.the problems come as hundreds of bangladeshi clothing factories per month are inspected for firesafety and structural problems under the accord on fire and building safety in bangladesh, which is backed by over 170 international brands, including primark and marks & spencer, and international trade unions, including industriall.the owner of one dhaka-based factory, softex cotton, has threatened legal action against the accord after his factory was closed down due to structural problems, prompting a demand for a reported $100m in compensation.another factory owner, who declined to be named, said that once a factory closed its doors, even for a few months, it would lose orders and close permanently: “there is no such thing as temporary closure,” he said. the factory owner said that the accord agreement had “pussyfooted” around the issue of who paid for factory closures amid efforts to get as many brands as possible to sign up to a deal in the wake of the rana plaza disaster. he said there was no clear process in place to handle the costs involved.jenny holdcroft, policy director for industriall, which has been closely involved in the accord, said that the agreement ensured that factories would not lose orders during closure because brands had committed to maintain orders with suppliers for two years.while 12 factories have been identified so far by the accord as needing significant work, holdcroft said many of those only needed partial closure in order to reduce stress on the building so production could continue on other floors. the accord also legally binds brands to ensure that workers are paid during factory closures. she said the detail on who would make payments had been left open in order to ensure that all those factory owners who could afford to pay for repairs and compensation for workers made the necessary contribution.“this was always going to be a topic of negotiation. brands don’t want to commit to paying so that rich factory owners who have just pocketed the profits and not been spending on their factories for years continue to do so. there was obviously going to be disruption. if there was no disruption, there would be no change,” she said. a spokesman for the accord said negotiations over payments and even legal action would not hold up its work to improve safety in factories.however, pressure on the accord to contribute to the payment of displaced workers has ratcheted up after a rival factory-safety group backed by us retailers including walmart and gap, the alliance for bangladesh worker safety, set aside $5m to help pay factory workers for up to two months while work is carried out on the buildings it has identified as needing improvement. it has, so far, identified five factories in four buildings where production needed to be suspended.“the alliance is sharing the workers’ salary along with entrepreneurs so now there is a big confusion. we had a big meeting with the accord to make them understand they have to come forward or how will we help our workers?” said shaidullah azim, a director of the bangladeshi garment manufacturers and exporters association.
advanced	the mass collection of telephone records by government surveillance programmes poses a clear threat to the personal privacy of ordinary citizens, according to us researchers who used basic phone logs to identify people and uncover confidential information about their lives.armed with anonymous “metadata” on people’s calls and texts, but not the content of the communications, two scientists at stanford university worked out individuals’ names, where they lived and the names of their partners. but that was not all.the same data led them to uncover potentially sensitive information about some individuals. one man was found to own a rifle, while another had recently been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. other data pointed to a new pregnancy and a person with multiple sclerosis.the results highlight the extraordinary power of telephone metadata – the number called, when and for how long – particularly when it is paired with public information available from services such as google, yelp and facebook. the value of the data, which is not subject to the same legal protections as the content of people’s communications, has long been recognized by the security services. as stewart baker, the former general counsel at the us national security agency (nsa), put it in the aftermath of edward snowden’s revelations: “metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody’s life.”patrick mutchler, a computer security researcher at stanford, said that while the power of metadata was understood by those gathering the information, the public was largely in the dark because so few published studies have revealed how rich the data is. “that makes it difficult for people with strong opinions about these programmes to fight them. now, we have hard evidence we can point to that didn’t exist in the past,” he said.for the study, the researchers signed up 823 people who agreed to have metadata collected from their phones through an android app. the app also received information from their facebook accounts, which the scientists used to check the accuracy of their results. in all, the researchers gathered metadata on more than 250,000 calls and over 1.2m texts.analysts who logged into the nsa’s metadata-gathering system were initially allowed to examine data up to three hops away from an individual. a call from the target individual’s phone to another number was one hop. from that phone to another was two hops. and so on. the records available to analysts stretched back for five years. the collection window has now been restricted to two hops and 18 months at most.writing in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences, mutchler describes how, on a shoestring budget, he and fellow graduate student, jonathan mayer, uncovered a wealth of personal information, some of it sensitive, about people who took part in the study. through automatic and manual searches, they identified 82% of people’s names. the same technique gave them the names of businesses the people had called. when these were plotted on a map, they revealed clusters of local businesses, which the scientists speculated surrounded the person’s home address. in this way, they named the city people lived in 57% of the time, and were nearly 90% accurate in placing people within 50 miles of their home. mutchler believes some of the misses came from people not updating their facebook page when they moved out of their parents’ home, for example, to go to college.the scientists next delved into more personal territory. using a simple computer program to analyse people’s call patterns, they inferred who among the study volunteers was in a relationship. once they knew the owner of a particular number had a partner, identifying the significant other was easy, they report.for the final part of the study, the researchers delved even deeper, to see what sensitive information they could glean from telephone metadata. they gathered details on calls made to and from a list of organizations, including hospitals, pharmacies, religious groups, legal services, firearms retailers and repair firms. from these, they pieced together some extraordinary vignettes from people’s lives.the metadata from one person in the study showed they had a long call from a cardiology centre, spoke briefly with a medical laboratory, answered a number of short calls from a local pharmacy and then made calls to a hotline for abnormal heart-rate monitoring devices. another participant made frequent calls to a local gun supplier that specialized in semiautomatic rifles and later placed a number of long calls to the customer support hotline run by a major gun manufacturer that produced the rifles. the metadata from two others suggested one had multiple sclerosis and the other had just become pregnant.“all of this should be taken as an indication of what is possible with two graduate students and limited resources,” said mutchler, who argues that the findings should make policymakers think twice before authorizing mass surveillance programmes. “large-scale metadata surveillance programmes, like the nsa’s, will necessarily expose highly confidential information about ordinary citizens,” the scientists write, adding: “to strike an appropriate balance between national security and civil liberties, future policymaking must be informed by input from relevant sciences.”ross anderson, professor of security engineering at cambridge university, said the study provided numbers that discussions can now be based on. “with the right analytics running over nationscale communications data, you can infer huge amounts of sensitive information on everyone. we always suspected that, of course, but here’s the data.”
advanced	from all across rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring burundi, people  ock to the southern town of butare to a little shop called inzozi nziza (sweet dreams). they come for a taste of the unknown, something most have never tasted ð the sweet, cold, velvety embrace of ice cream.here, at the central african countryõs  rst ice- cream parlour, customers can buy scoops in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple  avours. toppings include fresh fruit, honey, chocolate chips and granola. black tea and coffee are also on sale.the shop, which has òice cream, coffee, dreamsó across its signage, is milking local curiosity about the dessert ð and òchanging livesó in the process, says inzozi nzizaõs manager, louise ingabire.òice cream is important,ó she says between mouthfuls of a honey- avoured offering. òsome rwandans like ice cream, but itõs a new thing. we still have some work to do, to tell others that theyõll enjoy it.ótrue to inzozi nzizaõs motto, the shop can certainly make dreams come true. òi didnõt have a job before: i just stayed at home. now, i have a vision for the future. i am making money and i can give some of it to my family,ó says the 27-year-old.butare, which has 89,600 residents and is located 135km south of the capital, kigali, is the home of the national university of rwanda. inzozi nziza has become a hub for tired students looking to treat themselves to something cool and different.òitõs something uniting people here,ó kalisa migendo, a 24-year-old agriculture student, says. òif you need to go out and talk to a friend, a girl or a boy, you come to inzozi nziza for an ice cream.ómost of the ingredients are sourced locally and the milk comes from a depot in nearby nyanza. the vanilla beans and cocoa are imported.inzozi nziza was opened by the theatre director odile gakire katese. she met alexis miesen and jennie dundas, co-founders of blue marble ice cream in brooklyn, new york, and formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010.òan ice-cream shop, katese proposed, might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits, hopes and family traditions,ó miesen says.at the start, miesen and dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative and non-pro t. they did not set  nancial targets, but waited for 18 months before they transferred their shares to the women, who had by then proved their business credentials.the shopõs success is no exception, says fatuma ndangiza, deputy chief executive of the rwanda governance board. òsmall businesses are mostly managed by women but when it comes to big business where you have to compete for big tenders, very few women are there. women are newcomers to big business,ó she points out. òwe have more women entrepreneurs. itõs an area where women are taking an interest, both in and outside kigali.óthough ice cream is somewhat new to rwanda, ndangiza is enthused by the idea of the shop. òi think itõs great. it requires a lot of skills and changing peopleõs mindsets because selling and eating ice cream is not part of our culture. i think being able to innovate and introduce this on the market, and the process of making it, is quite interesting.óthe butare shop employs nine women, who spend their spare time practising with ingoma nshya, rwandaõs  rst and only female drumming troupe, which was established by katese ten years ago.the musicians are hutu and tutsi women, some survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million tutsis and moderate hutus were killed.some members of ingoma nshya are widows, some orphans. others have been affected by the massacre in different ways.historically, says ingabire, rwandan women were forbidden to drum and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry. òbut itõs something which brings unity.óingabireõs father, two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide. òsome of us are survivors; some know someone who was killed,ó she says. òwhen iõm drumming with them, it gives me power because weõre still alive and survivors.óthe popular eatery features in a documentary by rob and lisa fruchtman, sibling  lm-makers. sweet dreams, which tells the story of how the women have forged a promising post-genocide future, also includes the female drummers.the  lm, which has been screened in more than a dozen countries, including the us, uk and several african states, premieres in rwanda in 2014. òwe feel the  lm is about resilience, hope, bravery, resourcefulness and the ability to change the course of your own life,ó says lisa fruchtman, who won an academy award for  lm- editing in 1984.
advanced	vienna is the worldõs best city to live in, baghdad is the worst and london, paris and new york do not even make it into the top 35, according to international research into quality of life.german-speaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th mercer quality of life study, with vienna joined by zurich, munich, dusseldorf and frankfurt in the top seven.paris has tumbled down the league, falling ten places to 37th, just ahead of london at 39th, almost entirely because of the cityõs vulnerability to terrorist attacks.the study examined social and economic conditions, health, education, housing and the environment, and is used by big companies to assess where they should locate and how much they should pay staff.viennese-born helena hartlauer, 32, said she was not surprised at her cityõs top position. the municipalityõs social democratic government has a long tradition of investing in high-quality social housing, making vienna almost uniquely affordable among major cities.òi live in a 100sq-metre turn-of-the-century apartment in a good area about 20 minutesõ walk from the city centre. but my rent is just û800 (£625) a month.ó an equivalent apartment in london would cost upwards of £2,000 and even more in new york, ranked 44th in the table.us cities perform relatively poorly in the study, largely because of issues around personal safety and crime. the highest ranking city in the us is san francisco, at 28th; boston is 34th. canadian cities, led by vancouver, far outrank their us rivals in the table.òyou donõt realize how safe vienna is until you head abroad,ó said hartlauer. òwe also have terri c public transport, with the underground working 24 hours at weekends, and it only costs û1 per trip.óvienna bene ted enormously from the fall of the berlin wall, becoming the gateway to eastern european countries that often have historic ties to the former austro-hungarian empire.òour big usp is our geographical location,ó said martin eichtinger, austrian ambassdaor to london, who lived in vienna for 20 years. òthe fall of the berlin wall helped de ne vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in central europe.óaccording to the world bank, austria has one of the highest  gures for gdp per head in the world, just behind the us and ahead of germany and britain, although quite some way below neighbouring switzerland.zurich in switzerland is named by mercer as having the worldõs second highest quality of life but the viennese say their city is far more fun. òthere are more students in vienna than any other german-speaking city,ó said hartlauer. òitõs a very fast growing, young and lively city,ó she added ð though she conceded she works for the cityõs tourist board.vienna has long been overlooked by british weekend city break tourists, who instead  ock to barcelona or berlin and tend to think of austria as somewhere for skiing, lakes and mountains.but, after an increase in budget  ights from regional british cities such as manchester and edinburgh, vienna is fast catching up as a popular destination. in 2015, there were 588,000 british visitors to vienna, up 18% on the year before. the  ow is both ways; eichtinger said london has become the number one city destination for austrian visitors.òvienna has ranked top in the last seven published rankings,ó said mercer. òit scores highly in a number of categories; it provides a safe and stable environment to live in, a high level of public utilities and transport facilities and good recreational facilities.óthe european migrant crisis, which has seen large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers pass through vienna en route to germany, has had little impact on the city of nearly 1.8 million people, said eichtinger. òwe have managed to accommodate 90,000 refugees in austria but the numbers have slowed in recent months.ólondon has never been in the quality-of-life top ten, says mercer, damaged by its poor scores for air pollution, traf c congestion and climate. after london, edinburgh is the next-ranking british city, in 46th place.paris has suffered the biggest fall in the most recent rankings. òparis remained stable for several years but has, this year, dropped ten places in the overall ranking,ó said mercer.òthe drop was essentially due to the terrorist attacks in 2015. however, it is important to highlight that safety issues are a very highly weighted factor within the ôbasketõ so any small adjustments can have a big impact on the ranking.óauckland in new zealand was the highest ranking english-speaking city in the survey, in third place, followed by vancouver in  fth. australian cities also perform very highly in the survey, with sydney 10th and melbourne 15th. the economist has consistently ranked melbourne as the worldõs most liveable city, although its survey has been criticized as too anglocentric.war and political unrest are behind all the worst-ranked cities in the world. surprisingly, damascus is named as only the seventh worst, ranked better than not just baghdad but also bangui in central african republic, sanaõa in yemen, port-au-prince in haiti, khartoum in sudan and nõdjamena in chad.
advanced	seaworld has suffered an 84% collapse in pro ts as customers have deserted the controversial aquatic theme park company following claims it mistreated orca whales.the company, which trains dolphins and killer whales to perform tricks in front of stadiums full of spectators, has reported declines in attendance, sales and pro ts because of òcontinued brand challengesó.seaworld has been in the headlines since the 2013 documentary black sh detailed claims that its treatment of orca whales provoked violent behaviour, contributing to the deaths of three people. following the release of the documentary, attendance collapsed, the company lost more than half of its market value on wall street and its former ceo was forced out.the company has since launched a nationwide marketing campaign to combat animal rights activists claims that, among other things, captive orcas die at a younger age than their wild counterparts.despite cutting ticket prices and spending $10m on the marketing blitz, which features its veterinarians caring for whales, seaworld ceo joel manby was forced to admit that the company is still struggling to convince the public that it treats its whales well.òwe realize we have much work ahead of us to recover more of our attendance base, increase revenue and improve our performance, as returning to historical performance levels will take time and investment,ó manby said. òon the reputation side, early feedback on our campaign has been positive. however, we recognize that fully resolving our brand challenges in california will require sustained focus and commitment to correct misinformation.óòwe will continue to  ght with the facts because the facts are on our side,ó he said recently on a conference call with journalists and analysts. manby, who joined the company as ceo in 2015 to help the company rehabilitate itself, said he would set out his vision for the future of the company at a special event on 6 november.already in the pipeline are plans for a new shark exhibition in orlando and an attraction in san antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a ònaturalisticó setting.the companyõs  nancial report, released on 6 august, showed net income in the second quarter dropped from $37.4m in 2014 to $5.8m in 2015, an 84% decrease. revenue fell from $405m to $392m. attendance dropped by more than 100,000 from 6.58 million to 6.48 million.analysts will now be closely watching seaworldõs sales and attendance numbers in the third quarter, which is traditionally the companyõs most pro table and covers the summer holiday season. attendance may suffer from a fresh scandal in july 2015, in which a seaworld employee was alleged to have in ltrated animal rights protest groups against the company.jared goodman, director of animal law for people for the ethical treatment of animals (peta), which has been leading campaigns against seaworld, said: òseaworld is in the midst of a spying scandal, animals are dying in its tanks and tens of thousands of people have opposed its bid to build a new orca prison so it should come as no surprise that seaworldõs quarterly earnings have plummeted yet again in the second quarter. families just donõt want to buy tickets to see orcas going insane inside tiny tanks and seaworldõs pro ts, like the orcas, wonõt recover until the abusement park empties its tanks and builds coastal sanctuaries.óseaworldõs shares, which were worth $39 in 2013, were changing hands for just under $18 in august 2015.
