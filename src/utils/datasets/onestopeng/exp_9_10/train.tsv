intermediate	on the top of a hill, looking down on northumberland’s beautiful kielder water reservoir, a group of people wait in a car park next to a strange wooden building. they are looking for darkness and this is kielder observatory, the centre of britain’s latest industry – astrotourism. the people waiting outside are the lucky ones. many more apply for a night of stargazing at the observatory but numbers are strictly limited.inside, under a dim light, the observatory’s founder and lead astronomer, gary fildes, delivers a speech to his colleagues and volunteers. the team discusses the prospect of seeing the northern lights but fildes is doubtful. instead, they decide to use their powerful telescopes to observe jupiter and venus and, later, to pick out stars such as capella and betelgeuse. an additional attraction is the appearance of the international space station.fildes, 49, is at the forefront of the uk’s growing astrotourism industry. the key moment for northumberland came in 2013 when the entire national park, about 1,500 square kilometres in area, was awarded dark sky park status, the only one in england. dark sky parks are rare. the 2013 star count revealed that only 5% of the uk population can see more than 31 stars on a clear night.the arizona-based international dark-sky association (ida) awards the status of dark sky park only to places that take major steps to avoid light pollution. and those areas must also prove their night skies are dark enough. in northumberland dark sky park, as the area was renamed, it is so dark that venus casts a shadow on the earth.duncan wise, visitor development officer for the northumberland national park authority, helped to lead the campaign for dark-sky status. “we tend to look at landscape as everything up to the horizon,” wise said. “but what about what’s above it?” wise and others spent years preparing their application to the ida, collecting thousands of light readings and producing an exterior lighting master plan that influences the construction of new developments in the area.their efforts have been rewarded. many of the 1.5 million who visit northumberland each year are now aware of its dark sky status. “we get a lot of people coming here to see the sky now,” says the man at the car-hire firm in newcastle. “they come in autumn and winter, when it’s darkest. it’s good for the local hotels because they get business all year round now.” local hotels now give guests night-vision torches and put out deckchairs at night.wise agrees that northumberland needs to do more to take advantage of its scarce resource. he believes the region needs a couple more observatories to ensure that visitors will see what they came for. a new £14m national landscape discovery centre will have an observatory when it is completed in a couple of years.fildes has big ambitions. he is planning britain’s first “astrovillage”, one that would contain the largest public observatory in the world and have a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, a one-metre aperture telescope, and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes. the multimillion-pound project would also have a hotel and draw in 100,000 people a year, four times the number currently able to use the observatory. fildes believes the astrovillage will be a reality by 2018.however, northumberland has competition. galloway forest park in scotland also has dark sky park status. since exmoor was designated europe’s first international dark sky reserve – one level below dark sky park – in 2011, a range of local businesses offering stargazing breaks and safaris has sprung up. the uk has a long way to go to rival northern chile, which has more than a dozen tourist observatories and some of the clearest skies in the world. the teide national park in tenerife is also becoming a major astrotourism destination.so, why do people want to look up into the night sky? the media have helped. tv presenters like brian cox have attracted a new generation of stargazers. “brian cox has made astronomy accessible,” says wise. “it’s no longer seen as something just for professors with telescopes.” technology has also made astronomy more popular. apps such as stellarium now turn smartphones into pocket-size planetariums. but fildes believes that, most importantly, people are starting to appreciate what lies above. “if you had to build a visitor attraction from scratch, what could be better than the universe?”nan
intermediate	will we soon live in a world where drones deliver packages? if you believe amazon, the answer is òyesó. others are not so sure: we need to make more technical progress in this area but there is also the problem of public safety.amazon spokesman paul misener told a us congress hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place. the federal aviation authority (faa) will  nally have regulations on the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by june 2016. but the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines arenõt legal yet ð only drones up to 25kg will be legal. and the faa says that, if youõre going to crowd the skies with radio- controlled  ying robots, they must all use different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack.professor sajiv singh, who runs a cargo delivery company called nearearth, said that, to pilot a state-of-the-art drone, you simply give it some basic instructions: go to this altitude, perform this short task, go back home. but even short  ights from a mobile landing pad could cause serious logistical problems, he said.òtheyõre not going to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; theyõre going to deliver from a warehouse to the consumer, which will probably be an urban area or a suburban area,ó he said. òin those particular cases, there are going to be hazards that the vehicle is going to have to see. maybe there will be terrain that the map doesnõt know about. then, maybe thereõs construction equipment that wasnõt there before but is there now. maybe gps signals are blocked, in which case itõs going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.ó all these problems can be solved, he said ð but itõs dif cult.one major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks. òif you have an off-the-shelf uav [unmanned aerial vehicle], itõll just keep going and crash into the ground,ó said roboticist daniel huber.furthermore, òyou canõt do everything with a 25kg aircraftó, said jay mcconville, director of business development for unmanned systems at lockheed martin. òpeople in the aircraft business have to remind ourselves that the operator doesnõt really care about every little thing about the aircraft and wants instead to focus on the end result,ó he said. òoperators want to see vehicle status information; they want to see video on their handheld device or their laptop.óòtechnologically, most of the things that we need for this are in place,ó said huber. he is working on a program to allow drones to inspect infrastructure ð pipelines, telephone lines, bridges and so on. òweõve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and it will  y around that area and look at every surface and then report back.óhuber, who works on 3d systems imagery, said about amazon: òi have heard them say that many packages are lightweight ð a drone can carry a kilogram for 15 minutes. if you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood, it can deliver from that base. you need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have that distance.ó itõs one way, he said, of making sure the surrounding population is relatively safe. òthe larger you get, the more dangerous you get.óproblems with the use of drones can be solved in some very dramatic ways, huber said. at a recent conference, he said, a disaster relief drone company demonstrated a robot that could take off and, when it got tired, land on its own charging station and exchange its batteries.of course, safety is still a major concern ð singh says that, for a commercial aircraft to be allowed to  y, it has to prove a rate of one serious failure every one million hours. drones, he said, are a long way from that. òthe reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours,ó singh said. but they donõt consider an oil leak a catastrophic failure ð something has to fall out of the sky.part of the reason for this is that air travel is dangerous so standards are much higher. òif you  y commercial airlines, they often say, ôoh, a component has failed ð we have to go back to the gate,õó singh said. òand thatõs an established industry with 60 years of legacy! i hate to think that a drone might come down on a busy road.ó part of the solution, singh said, is planning for every situation: òif things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.ónan
intermediate	from all across rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring burundi, people are coming to the southern town of butare to a little shop called inzozi nziza (sweet dreams). they come for a taste of the unknown, something most have never tasted before ð sweet, cold ice cream.here, at the central african countryõs  rst ice- cream parlour, customers can buy scoops in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple  avours. toppings include fresh fruit, honey, chocolate chips and granola. black tea and coffee are also on sale.the shop, which has òice cream, coffee, dreamsó written on its signs, is taking advantage of local curiosity about the dessert ð and òchanging livesó in the process, says inzozi nzizaõs manager, louise ingabire.òice cream is important,ó she says between mouthfuls of a honey- avoured offering. òsome rwandans like ice cream, but itõs a new thing. we still have some work to do, to tell others that theyõll enjoy it.óthe shop can certainly make dreams come true. òi didnõt have a job before: i just stayed at home. now, i have a vision for the future. i am making money and i can give some of it to my family,ó says the 27-year-old.butare, which has 89,600 residents and is located 135km south of the capital, kigali, is the home of the national university of rwanda. inzozi nziza has become a meeting place for tired students looking to treat themselves to something cool and different.òitõs something uniting people here,ó kalisa migendo, a 24-year-old agriculture student, says. òif you need to go out and talk to a friend, a girl or a boy, you come to inzozi nziza for an ice cream.ómost of the ingredients are from local sources and the milk comes from nearby nyanza. the vanilla beans and cocoa are imported.inzozi nziza was opened by the theatre director odile gakire katese. she met alexis miesen and jennie dundas, co-founders of blue marble ice cream in brooklyn, new york, and formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010.òan ice-cream shop, katese said, might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits, hopes and family traditions,ó miesen says.at the start, miesen and dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative and non-pro t. after 18 months, they transferred their shares to the women, who had by then proved they could run the business.ice cream is new to rwanda. making the business successful requires a lot of skills and changing peopleõs way of thinking because selling and eating ice cream is not part of rwandan culture.the butare shop employs nine women, who spend their spare time practising with ingoma nshya, rwandaõs  rst and only female drumming group, which was established by katese ten years ago.the musicians are hutu and tutsi women. some are survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million tutsis and hutus were killed. some members of ingoma nshya are widows, some orphans.historically, says ingabire, rwandan women were forbidden to drum and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry. òbut itõs something which brings unity.óingabireõs father, two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide. òwhen iõm drumming, it gives me power because weõre still alive and survivors,ó she says.the ice-cream parlour is in a documentary by  lm-makers rob and lisa fruchtman. sweet dreams, which tells the story of how the women have made a promising post-genocide future, also includes the female drummers.the  lm has been shown in more than a dozen countries, including the us, uk and several african states. òwe feel the  lm is about resilience, hope, bravery, resourcefulness and the ability to change the course of your own life,ó says lisa fruchtman.nannan
intermediate	they call him the robin hood of the banks, a man who took out many loans worth almost half a million euros with no intention of ever paying them back. instead, enric duran gave the money to projects that created and promoted alternatives to capitalism.after 14 months in hiding, duran is unapologetic, even though his activities could put him in jail. òiõm proud of what i did,ó he said in an interview by skype from a secret location.from 2006 to 2008, duran took out 68 commercial and personal loans from 39 banks in spain. he gave the money to social activists, who used it to pay for speaking tours against capitalism and tv cameras for a media network. he said he saw that these social movements were building alternatives but that they didnõt have enough money. òmeanwhile, constant growth was creating a system that created money out of nothing.óthe loans he swindled from banks were his way of regulating and denouncing this situation, he said. he started slowly. òi  lled out a few credit applications with my real details. they said no, but i just wanted to understand what they were asking for.ófrom there, the former table-tennis coach began to set up a confusing web of accounts, payments and transfers. òi was learning constantly.ó by the summer of 2007, he had discovered how to make the system work ð he applied for loans under the name of a false television production company. òthen, i managed to get a lot.ó û492,000, to be exact.duran was arrested in spain in 2009, on charges brought against him by six of the 39 banks that had lent him money. he spent two months in prison before being let out on û50,000 bail. in february 2013, threatened with up to eight years in prison, he decided to  ee rather than stand trial because, he said, he doesnõt recognize the authority of the judicial system.his actions, he said, were an important part of a worldwide debate on the economic crisis. the timing pushed the anti-capitalist movement into the light, just as many spaniards were looking for alternatives to a system that has caused chaos in their lives. in todayõs spain, the anti-capitalist movement, and groups such as the indignados, are supported by thousands of spaniards.duran is now widening his focus to include spainõs justice system, by promoting restorative justice. òthe people in spain who believe that banks donõt work, they think that i donõt owe anything. iõve already done my work,ó he said. òbut there is a part of a population that is not in agreement with us and i think i should respond to that.óin his case, he said, he could offer banks the insight he got from years of obtaining bank loans fraudulently. he could share his thoughts on òwhich best practices work and the bad ones that donõt,ó he suggested, òfor the general population and for bank workersó.
intermediate	a canadian man who became famous because he offered a free round-the-world trip to a woman with the same name as his ex-girlfriend has returned from the trip with his chosen namesake. unfortunately, to the disappointment of those following the story, the two of them did not fall in love. jordan axani, a 28-year-old toronto charity founder, arrived back in canada with elizabeth quinn gallagher and said the pair had “a brother-sister-like relationship”.axani had made headlines in 2014 because he offered an air ticket to any canadian named elizabeth gallagher. he had booked a three-week vacation with his girlfriend but they split up and he was unable to change the name on the flight tickets.that’s where axani’s new travelling companion, a 23-year-old student from cole harbour, nova scotia, enters the story. elizabeth gallagher, who calls herself quinn, replied to an online posting from axani and she was chosen. gallagher explained before the trip that she had a “pretty serious” boyfriend. but that had not stopped journalists from hoping the globetrotters might fall for one another. unfortunately, it did not happen.“i’m going to be very clear,” axani said, soon after the pair returned to toronto. “this was never a romantic endeavour. it was strictly platonic. i do not think of quinn in a romantic way at all. there is no future for us romantically. she is a good friend. i think of her as a little sister and that is it. and our feelings are entirely mutual.”it took work to create that brother-sister, good-friend relationship, however. “it wasn’t easy and it certainly wasn’t immediate. it took us about a week to really figure each other out,” axani said. there was a certain amount of stumbling around as the pair got to know each other “about the dos and don’ts of travelling together. at the end of it, we’d developed a really great rhythm – one second, we had really funny inside jokes and, the next second, we knew when the other person needed space.”although the pair did not fall in love, axani said the trip, which included milan, venice, vienna, prague, khao lak (in thailand) and hong kong, was “fantastic”. a favourite place was prague, axani said, where they met more people than anywhere else on the trip.“over the course of two and a half days i think we met about two dozen people. so that’s a lot of stories, that’s a lot of individuals and that’s a lot of love for their home city of prague.”people were following the pair on twitter and instagram, axani said, and they were even recognized in the street in hong kong. “it was a real adventure. we had a blast. we learned a lot about ourselves and about each other. i can’t imagine it going much better than it did.”axani arrived back in toronto at 3am and went straight into a meeting at his charity, a ticket forward. axani started the non-profit organization after his internet post went viral. he wants to offer round-the-world-trips to survivors of abuse, cancer and war.apart from that, axani is also discussing making his story into a television show or film, he said. but he would not comment on what form those productions might take. “i’ll only say that there’s been lots of interest from many production companies. we’re well advanced.” in terms of his love life, axani said he was not looking for his next elizabeth gallagher yet. “i’m not looking for anything but life happens and we’ll see,” he said. “as always, life’s a journey.”
intermediate	behind the bright lights and mirrored panels, cameras are watching you. if you pick up a boot, a camera will make sure you donõt put it into your bag. enter a department store and you will be watched. but new technology is less focused on shoplifting and more interested in your age, sex and shopping habits.a few months ago, it company computer sciences corporation (csc) wrote a report that said around 30% of stores use facial recognition technology to track customers in-store. facial recognition is a technology that can identify people by analysing and comparing facial features from a database. it uses devices such as intel realsense cameras, which are able to analyse everything from particular expressions to the clothing brands someone is wearing.intel spokesman joe jensen says that the aim of using realsense technology in shops is not to create databases of speci c peopleõs lives but to build generalized models of peopleõs lifestyles and shopping habits. òwe donõt need to know a particular customer. we need to know that this shopper has these characteristics and that, when those characteristics are present, this is what a person tends to do.óif you combine recognition technology with databases of previous customer patterns, you can start to predict a lot about what a person may or may not do in a shop. if, for example, thereõs a woman walking quickly towards the sock section, you can use that data to predict she wants to buy socks. that could allow a store to automatically put targeted ads on screens aimed speci cally at that person. if she looks like the type of person who wants to buy socks, they will show her adverts for socks.if it sounds familiar, itõs because the online world has been using techniques like these for years. if you search for something on amazon, youõll get targeted ads for similar products on other sites. but itõs not easy to bring these systems into the physical world. people do not react to cameras in the same way as they do to browser cookies.hoxton analytics, a team of data scientists in london, has developed a technology that uses machine learning and arti cial intelligence to categorize people based on the shoes they are wearing. by analysing the style and size of peopleõs footwear as they walk past the sensor, the system can identify a customerõs gender with 75-80% accuracy.owen mccormack, hoxton analytics ceo, says that the focus of the system was partly a reaction to facial recognition. òmy idea was, why donõt we simply consider the clothes someoneõs wearing?ó he said. òif i just showed you a photo of someoneõs body, you could probably tell me what gender they are. however, pointing a camera at someoneõs chest or hips feels just as creepy as facial recognition. the idea was ð what about peopleõs shoes?ópeople use the word òcreepyó a lot during discussions of in-store tracking. for stores and data scientists, the aim is to  nd a way of getting information without seeming intrusive.for mccormack, the argument is based on the fact that personal information isnõt collected. òright now, shops are doing lots of incredibly invasive things but we just donõt know about it. what we say is that, if you know someoneõs a male or a female, then your advertising will be much more ef cient. if you know that everyone in your shop right now is a male, youõll be advertising playstations not hairdryers.ófrom the perspective of stores, itõs understandable that physical shops want some of the information online shops collect. we allow this to happen online so why not of ine? online, you get a pop-up asking you to accept cookies. but you canõt ask for peopleõs consent in the same way when they move from one physical shop to another.but itõs also true that the generation that is growing up with online shopping does not see online advertising as so invasive. in the csc report, a survey showed that 72% of people aged 55 or more said they were very uncomfortable with these types of technologies in physical shops. but only 51% of 16-24 year olds said they were uncomfortable.are younger people more open because they are more familiar with digital technology or do they believe in the honesty of organizations offering free services? is this kind of technology always creepy or does it depend? in any case, there are a growing number of eyes between the shelves and they care a lot about what youõre wearing.nannan
intermediate	in the arctic regions of canada, the summer sun shines for more than 20 hours a day. for some, it’s a welcome change from the constant darkness of winter. but, for the small but growing muslim community of iqaluit, nunavut, life in the land of the midnight sun is a real challenge during the month of ramadan, when muslims typically fast from sunrise to sunset.“i haven’t fainted once,” said 29-year-old abdul karim, one of the few in the area who has carefully timed his ramadan fast to the arctic sun since moving from ottawa in 2011. this year, that means eating at about 1.30am before the sun rises and breaking his fast at about 11pm when the sun sets. “the only reason to stop would be if it hurts my health,” karim said.it is nearly the end of ramadan for muslims around the world. fasting is important but, during the holy month, in every muslim community, there is also a focus on community work, prayer and reflection. but, in iqaluit and the other muslim communities in the arctic, the long days have forced a change in how they fast.most muslims in iqaluit follow the timetable followed by muslims in ottawa, about 1,300 miles south – this follows the advice of muslim scholars who have said muslims in the far north should observe ramadan using the timetable of mecca or the nearest muslim city. it still means fasting for around 18 hours a day, said atif jilani, who moved to iqaluit from toronto. “the days are long, but it’s more manageable.”many in the community of 100 people break their fast together – they gather in the city’s brand new mosque for nightly suppers. as they tuck into traditional food such as dates and goat or lamb curries, the sun shines brightly through the windows.it’s a similar situation across canada’s most northern mosques during ramadan, as muslims deal with the country’s unique geography. in recent years, much of the community has chosen to follow the ramadan timetable of edmonton, in alberta. some follow the timings of mecca, for example awan, a father of two young children, including a 12-year-old who recently started fasting. he hopes to encourage his son with the more manageable timetable of about 15 hours of fasting compared with about 18 hours in edmonton. “if i fast edmonton times, my son might say, ‘papa, you are really insane. what are you doing?’” he said.for the 100 or so muslims in inuvik, a small town 125 miles north of the arctic circle, it is impossible to follow the local movements of the sun. they have also been following edmonton’s timetable. “we currently have 24 hours a day of sun,” said ahmad alkhalaf. “there’s no sunrise or sunset.”they were already following the edmonton schedule in 2001 when he moved from toronto to the small northern community of 3,500 people. “my first ramadan here was in december. there’s no sun at that time; it’s dark all day and night. so we used edmonton time.”at times, it can be difficult to follow the clock rather than what is happening outside, alkhalaf said. “you’re supposed to break your fast when it’s dusk but we eat when the sun is up. it’s not usual to have iftar [the meal that breaks the fast] when the sun is up,” he said.in inuvik, where most of the population is inuit, the muslim community has tried to strike a balance between ramadan and the local culture and traditions. the iftar meal includes dates and curries – as well as local game such as reindeer. “we make a soup or curry, but instead of using beef, we use reindeer.”in iqaluit, as the muslim community prepares to mark the end of ramadan, some reflect that 2016’s timing – stretching across some of the longest days of the year – has made it one of the more difficult of recent years. it’s particularly true for those like karim who have followed the local sunrise and sunset carefully. but, his efforts will be rewarded in future years, said karim, thanks to the lunar calendar. ramadan will eventually fall during winter and, in iqaluit, the sun will rise and set within a few hours each day. “i’ll follow those hours, too,” he said with a laugh. “oh yes, definitely.”nan
intermediate	apart from volcanoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, there are two key things that can make a city disintegrate or even totally disappear ð water and sand. a century ago, venice ð one of the most beautiful and low-lying cities in the world ð used to  ood around ten times a year. nowadays, its lowest point, piazza san marco (only three feet above sea level) is inundated with water approximately 100 times a year.but rising sea levels are not the only cause. in many parts of the world, the land is also sinking. in venice, subsoil compaction (a result of industrial exploitation of the surrounding area) lowered the city by 20cm between 1950 and 1970. ho chi minh city in vietnam is also sinking by about 2cm a year ð but thatõs nothing compared to jakarta, which is dropping 10 to 20cm each year. in the past three decades, the city has sunk roughly four metres. unfortunately for the indonesian capital, it has pumped out so much groundwater to support its population that the land above is drying out and compacting ð this has created a bowl. rivers that used to  ow through the city down to the sea have had to be diverted because they cannot drain uphill.while there are many plans to save venice ð and ho chi minh city and jakarta are taking the problem seriously ð the same cannot be said for miami, where politicians refuse to admit the city has a serious environmental problem.there are three problems in miami. it is less than ten feet above sea level; an increasing number of tropical storms are inundating the city; and it is built on porous rock, which is absorbing the rising seawater. this water then  lls the cityõs foundations and comes up through drains and pipes, forcing sewage upwards and polluting its fresh water. it is possible that miami may one day become uninhabitable.in the maldives, the populations of whole islands are now considering abandoning their homes. the capital, male_, population 153,379 and only four feet above sea level, has built a ten-foot sea wall at a cost of $63 million ð but, long term, only a stabilization of rising sea levels will save it and the rest of the islands.in africa, deserti cation is causing the sahara to spread south at a rate of 30 miles per year, threatening settlements in northern mauritania. over the past 20 years, for example, the desert has grown by more than 260 acres around the trading and religious centre of chinguetti, where the population has declined from 20,000 people in the mid-twentieth century to just a few thousand now. trading has almost completely stopped as sand piles up in the streets. likewise, the californian resort of rancho mirage, near palm springs, may have to be abandoned in the next decade. this city is just one example of a problem caused not so much by global warming as human over-expansion. californiaõs dream of farming the desert made sense while its total population remained around half a million (in 1870) ð but now the state is home to 38 million people, who own 32 million vehicles.the daily water use in rancho mirage is more than 200 gallons per person, which is causing a man-made drought. a 25% cut in water use has been implemented but this is unlikely to stabilize the resort, which is surrounded by sand and dust. the long-term answer in californiaõs desert is likely to be the abandonment of some cities.fire is a growing threat to urban settlements in america ð in fact, forest  res cause the most damage after severe storms, with 800 major  re disasters there between 1953 and 2014. a new report by the usda forest service maps the increasing number of urban locations that are particularly vulnerable to wild re.similarly in australia, some of victoriaõs resorts and several melbourne suburbs have been placed on a list of the stateõs 52 most vulnerable bush re spots because long-term droughts are making trees highly combustible. itõs unlikely that a forest  re will ever destroy an entire city but a succession of  res could make it uninhabitable. many cities are  ghting a losing battle against nature but is it possible to identify the worlds most vulnerable city? natural events are very dif cult to predict  but males future looks particularly bad because, even if its new sea wall continues to be effective, the islands around the maldives capital are going to disappear before too long. and, if they disappear, males raison detre disappears, too.nannannan
intermediate	swedish prisons have long had a reputation around the world for being progressive. but are the country’s prisons a soft option?the head of sweden’s prison and probation service, nils oberg, said in november 2013 that four swedish prisons will close due to an “out of the ordinary” fall in prisoner numbers.although there has been no fall in crime rates, between 2011 and 2012 there was a 6% fall in sweden’s prisoner population, now a little over 4,500. a similar decrease is expected in 2013 and 2014. oberg said he was puzzled by the unexpected fall, but hoped that the reason was to do with how his prisons are run. “we certainly hope that the efforts we put into rehabilitation and preventing criminals from reoffending has made a difference,” he said.“the modern prison service in sweden is very different from when i joined as a young prison officer in 1978,” says kenneth gustafsson, governor of kumla prison, sweden’s most secure jail, 130 miles west of stockholm. however, he doesn’t think the system has gone soft. “when i joined, the focus was very much on humanity in prisons. prisoners were treated well – maybe too well, some might say. but, after a number of escapes in 2004, we had to place more emphasis on security.”the swedes still have a humane approach to sentencing, even of the most serious offenders: jail sentences are not usually more than ten years. those who receive life imprisonment can still apply to the courts after a decade to have the sentence changed to a fixed sentence, usually between 18 and 25 years. sweden was the first country in europe to introduce the electronic tagging of convicted criminals and continues to keep prison sentences short wherever possible by using community-based measures. these have been effective at stopping criminals from reoffending.the overall reoffending rate in sweden is between 30 and 40% over three years – to compare that with another european country, the number is around half that of the uk. one thing that has kept reoffending down and the number of prisoners in sweden below 70 per 100,000 people is that the age of criminal responsibility is 15. in the uk, for example, children aged ten to 17 and young people under the age of 21 have the highest reoffending rates. in sweden, no young person under the age of 21 can be sentenced to life – this is not the case in many other countries – and they try to keep young offenders out of prison.one strong reason for the fall in prison numbers might be the amount of post-prison support available in sweden. a government-run probation service supervises people on probation and provides treatment programmes for offenders with drug, alcohol or violence problems. the service is helped by around 4,500 members of the public who volunteer to befriend and support offenders under supervision.i spoke to a former prisoner who now runs a group called x-cons sweden. peter soderlund served almost three years of a four-year sentence for drug and weapons offences before he was released in 1998. he was helped by an organization run by other former prisoners called kris (criminals’ return into society).both organizations work with the same goal: helping prisoners successfully fit back into society after they have been released. and what is life like for the prisoner in sweden? “when i was inside, i was lucky.” says soderlund. “in osteraker prison, where i served my sentence, we were treated well. but i knew that not all swedish prisons were like that. i met so many people in there who needed help – after i received help from kris, i knew i wanted to help others. with x-cons, we meet them at the prison gate and support them into accommodation and offer a network of support.”“in sweden, we believe very much in the idea of rehabilitation,” says gustafsson. “of course, there are some people who will not or cannot change. but, in my experience, the majority of prisoners want to change and we must do what we can to help them.”nannan
intermediate	there are many quirky solutions to help make our cities more livable, such as glow-in-the-dark trees, underground bike sheds and solar-powered bins. city living has many upsides but a sustainable lifestyle is not always one of them. pollution, traf c and loss of green spaces are just some of the daily problems that city-dwellers have to deal with. we look at ten quirky solutions to making our cities better places to live.pop-up parks todayõs cities sometimes look like theyõre built more for cars than people. the pop-up park is a simple idea. take an empty car park, a small amount of money and a pot plant or two, and make yourself your own private park. the park(ing) project started as an arts experiment in san francisco. it has since spread across the world. temporary urban farms and ecology demonstrations are just some of the ideas that have come out of the project, which celebrates a day of action every september.subterranean storage not all urban dwellers have cars. bikes are becoming more and more fashionable. the question is: where to keep them safe? tokyo-based engineering company giken has a solution: an underground bicycle park. just seven metres wide, the cylindrical storage facility buries deep into the ground and can hold 204 bikes. owners can retrieve their bike at the touch of a button ð the automated system delivers it back above ground in around 13 seconds.glow-in-the-dark trees when most people think of trees that glow in the dark, christmas trees usually come to mind. not daan roosegaarde. the dutch designer-artist has invented a òbioluminescentó plant. the experimental technology joins dna from luminescent marine bacteria with the chloroplast genome of a plant to create a glow like a jelly sh. they are trying to create a version of the technology that roosegaarde hopes could one day replace normal street lighting.footfall harvesting every day, hundreds of commuters and shoppers in the east london neighbourhood of west ham cross the elevated pedestrian walkway close to the underground station. few people probably notice the springiness beneath their feet. even fewer realize that the springy rubber surface powers the streetlights above. the  oor has smart tiles that capture the energy from pedestriansõ footsteps and convert it into electricity. pavegen, the uk company who had the idea, has installed a similar system at londonõs heathrow airport and other international locations.supertrees it had to happen eventually: man-made trees. singaporeõs gardens by the bay has a group of them. up to 50 metres high, these steel-framed ôsupertreesõ not only have  owers growing up them ð their metallic canopies absorb and disperse heat, too. and they collect rainwater, as well as provide air ventilation for two large conservatories below. eleven of the 18 trees also have solar panels on their ôbranchesõ.
elementary	a new report says that almost one billion people will remain in extreme poverty by 2030 if countries donõt try to solve the social, economic and cultural problems that keep them poor. the report by the chronic poverty advisory network says that many people may rise above the poverty line of $1.25 a day, but fall back again when they have problems such as drought or illness and insecurity or con ict.the report found that, in parts of rural kenya and in south africa, 30 to 40% of people who escaped from poverty fell back again. this percentage rose to 60% in some areas of ethiopia between 1999 and 2009. even in successful countries such as indonesia and vietnam, the proportion was 20%.individual examples show how easy it is for people to fall back into poverty. amin is from a village in bangladesh. his income has fallen slowly, because of his illness and his wifeõs illness, the cost of his sonõs marriage, the death of his father and loss of goods such as  shing nets. lovemore, from zimbabwe, is now one of the poorest people in his village. he recently lost his job because of ill health and has to look after his  ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters.òwe need to make sure that people who come out of poverty remain above the poverty line permanently. too many families return to poverty when they have personal or bigger problems. governments shouldnõt assume that, just because somebodyõs income hits $1.25, that means the problem is solved,ó said andrew shepherd, the main author of the report.according to the un, the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 is still possible. but the report says that countries need to make changes to achieve zero poverty. there was a drop in extreme poverty from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 1.2 billion in 2010, but the report says that progress in the next 15 years will be much more dif cult. there has been a lot of progress in china but there will probably not be similar progress in other parts of the world.the report says countries should try to help the chronically poor ð those who are poor for many years or their entire lives ð and stop people becoming poor. ògovernments have been quite good at moving people over the poverty line because that is quite easy. but they have avoided the more dif cult job of trying to reduce chronic poverty,ó said shepherd.the report says progress on poverty reduction has helped people who were already closer to the poverty line, but has helped the chronically poor much less. it will not be possible to get to zero poverty if development policies donõt focus on the chronically poor, it adds. the report suggests three ideas. they all cost a lot of money.the  rst is social help ð to bring the poorest people closer to a good-enough standard of living. the second is education, from early childhood to the start of work, so people can escape and stay out of poverty. the third is economic growth policies that make sure that the bene ts of increasing national wealth reach the poorest people.all this will cost money and the report says higher taxes will be necessary. aid will also be necessary for the start-up costs for social assistance, healthcare for everyone and to  nance education. òthere remains a huge role for aid in the next 20 years, as many developing countries spend less than $500 on each of their citizens a year. even nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per person,ó shepherd said.the authors say governments should have a national development plan and make sure the poorest people are represented politically as well as trying to stop dif cult social customs, such as dowries and witchcraft, that make extreme poverty worse.nannannannan
elementary	barack obama has told young people to reject pessimism and meet people who have different political beliefs if they want to change the world.on the last day of his last visit to britain as us president, obama told 500 youth leaders at a meeting in london: “reject the idea that there are things we can’t control. as jfk said, our problems are manmade and can be solved by man.”“you’ve never had better tools to make a difference,” he told the students at the question-and-answer session. “reject pessimism and know that progress is possible.”but obama said he knew that young people had many challenges. he said it was a time of great change, with 9/11, 7/7, and with so much information and bad news, for example on twitter.the president told the audience to meet and talk with people who have different political beliefs: “look for people who don’t agree with you and it will also help you to compromise.”obama said he was proud of his healthcare reforms and talked about the 2008 financial crisis: “i saved the world from depression – that was quite good.”he also said that his talks with iran and the response to the ebola crisis were some of the best things about his presidency.tanya williams, a community officer, said: “i like barack obama and it’s exciting to hear someone who has changed so much.”oliver sidorczuk, 26, said: “everyone is extremely excited to listen to what he has to say.”furqan naeem, from manchester, said: “i recently visited the united states and i saw some really important work the president did – the work brought different people together.”later, obama met labour party leader, jeremy corbyn, who said they had an “excellent” 90-minute discussion. they also talked about britain’s membership of the eu.after the meeting, obama played golf with british prime minister, david cameron. obama had dinner with cameron and the us ambassador, matthew barzun, and, then, travelled to germany.nannannannannannannannannan
elementary	"the age of the big british summer music festival, including glastonbury, is ending, according to the top rock manager harvey goldsmith.he has produced and worked with most of the western worldõs biggest music stars, including the who, the rolling stones, queen, madonna, bob dylan and luciano pavarotti. he says that the biggest problem is a serious lack of major new bands to follow on from the old ones.òthe age of the music festival peaked about two years ago,ó he said, speaking at the hay festival of literature and arts in wales. òthere are too many festivals and there are not enough big bands to headline them. that is a big, big problem for us. and we are not producing new bands that can headline ð like the rolling stones, muse, even the arctic monkeys.óthere were about 900 music festivals in the uk between may and september in 2014, he said, and they cannot all continue. there will be lots of small combination festivals where it isnõt just music but also poetry or books or magic shows.goldsmith, 69, said that he is working with robin de levita, the dutch producer of the whoõs 1970s rock musical tommy. they will bring the  rst stage adaptation of the teen book and movie series the hunger games to a new 1,100-seat theatre in wembley, london, in june 2016.talking at hay, goldsmith also revealed some of the secrets of his long career in the music industry. he said that keith moon put dynamite down a sydney hotel room toilet to unblock it. and, he said that john lennon had stage fright at madison square garden in 1974 ð he vomited and they had to push him onto the stage. òitõs bizarre how common stage fright is among artists. itõs odd how afraid they get but, as soon as the music starts, theyõre  ne,ó he said.he also gave the answer to a rock õnõ roll mystery: why elvis presley never performed outside north america. presleyõs manager, colonel tom parker, told goldsmith that the real reason why elvis never performed in england was because parker was an immigrant.òhe explained that it was because he was an illegal dutch immigrant. he didnõt want to risk leaving the us,ó said goldsmith.and his ultimate rock õnõ roll performer? òfreddie mercury was our most powerful stage performer, the best live performer weõve ever had.óbut there is no group to follow queen, he said. òweõre not producing a new generation of this kind of band. coldplay is probably the last one and that was ten years ago.""so, with no big bands to headline, there are no big shows. glastonbury now canõt  nd any more big bands. the time of big music festivals is really ending.ónannannan"
elementary	the senior editor of the atlantic magazine, james hamblin, recently did an experiment. as part of his series, ôif our bodies could talkõ, hamblin reduced the number of showers he had and did not use shampoo and soap when he had a shower.he discovered what thousands of others have also discovered: the more we try to clean ourselves with soaps and body washes, the more our skin works to get back its balance. this means we have to begin the whole process again. showering removes oil and bacteria from the skin. many would say òthat is the reason i shower!ó but, it seems that this sometimes works too well, especially when you add hot water and soap products.our skin has millions of good bacteria. showering destroys these bacteria. and when the bacteria return, they produce an odour ð yes, showering too often may make you smell more. but, when you stop showering and using soap, your skin goes through a (probably gross) period of change. after this, the skin normally gets its balance back, it produces less oil and healthy bacteria  ourish.hamblin realized that the human body, working on its own, is lovely. we will smell and look better ð skin experts say that using less soap can improve skin problems. but, thatõs not the only advantage ð reducing the number of showers we have (and the number of cleansing products we use) can help the environment. the average shower lasts seven minutes and uses 65 litres of water. thatõs 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that we  ll with soap and wash down the drain each and every day ð sometimes more than once.the importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore ð for example, there is another summer of drought in california. itõs becoming clear that clean water is one of the most valuable things in the world and we soon wonõt have enough. there is also the environmental effect of all those body wash bottles. so, there are many very good reasons to shower less.perhaps you remember the last time you were close to people who already donõt shower enough but you can relax. many people who shower less still use deodorant and hand-washing with soap is still a vital way to reduce the spread of many diseases.you donõt need to give up showering completely, as james hamblin did, but if you shower a lot, we have some simple advice: reduce. shower less, put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria  ourish.
elementary	we do not yet live in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm back to the future ii, but smartphones and other new technologies are creating exciting possibilities. experts agree that economic and population changes, new technology, and environmental concerns are having a big effect on transportation.with an ageing transport infrastructure, cities in the us have to change and improve their transportation. experts and scientists now realize that old ways of reducing traf c congestion arenõt enough to solve the problems of population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now an environmental problem.big us cities like los angeles and chicago are adding more bus lanes and pedestrian walkways, and expanding rail networks. at the same time, they are creating advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment.here are three of the key ideas that experts predict will change transportation in the future.connectivity taxi-sharing services like uber and apps like waze, which  nds the quickest routes for drivers, are completely changing how people move around and affecting the way traf c moves through a city. communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era.according to a recent study, people born in the 1990s are using cars less than older generations. according to the study, people born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than older generations did at the same time in their lives. and, people who still drive cars are experiencing less traf c thanks to waze.traf c congestion is improving in other ways, too. at the moment, a traf c light knows when a car is getting close but thatõs all. companies are developing technology that allows a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.automation we have known about driverless cars ever since google began testing the vehicles in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. but, there is already some automation of cars. automation will probably happen in stages:  rst, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: vehicles that are connected electronically and travel one behind another.the idea of a fully automated transportation system is interesting because it could improve safety ð peopleõs mistakes wonõt cause accidents any more. it could also help reduce carbon emissions and traf c congestion. but, it will take a long time to get fully automated because the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.to see what driverless cars might look like on the road, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.environmental concern the world is trying to slow down climate change and countries and cities are trying to reduce emissions. these things could have a big effect on the future of transportation and lead to zero- and low-emission vehicles and apps that encourage more walking, cycling and carpooling. when thinking about the future of transportation, itõs also important to think about why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. technologies that reduce the need for those trips ð for example, online meetings or online work ð could also have a big effect on transportation.nannannan
elementary	on the top of a hill, above northumberland’s beautiful kielder water lake, a group of people are waiting in a car park next to a strange wooden building. they are here because of the darkness and this is kielder observatory, the centre of britain’s latest industry – astrotourism. the people who are waiting outside are lucky. many more people apply for a night of stargazing at the observatory but not everyone can come because numbers are strictly limited.inside, the observatory’s founder and lead astronomer, gary fildes, speaks to his colleagues and volunteers. the team discusses that they might see the northern lights but fildes doesn’t think they will. instead, they decide to use their powerful telescopes to look at jupiter and venus and, later, to find stars such as capella and betelgeuse. an extra attraction is the appearance of the international space station.fildes is a leading figure in the uk’s growing astrotourism industry. the key moment for northumberland came in 2013 when the entire national park, about 1,500 square kilometres in area, got dark sky park status. it is the only one in england. dark sky parks are rare. research in 2013 showed that only 5% of the uk population can see more than 31 stars on a clear night.the international dark-sky association (ida) gives the status of dark sky park only to places that take big steps to prevent light pollution. the areas must also prove their night skies are very dark. in northumberland dark sky park, it is so dark that venus casts a shadow on the earth.duncan wise, visitor development officer for the northumberland national park, helped to lead the campaign for dark-sky status. “we usually think that ‘landscape’ is everything up to the horizon,” wise said. “but what about what’s above the horizon?” wise and others spent years preparing their application to the ida – they collected thousands of light readings.because of their hard work, many of the 1.5 million tourists who visit northumberland each year are now aware of its dark sky status. “a lot of people come here to see the sky now,” says a man who works for a local car-hire company. “they come in autumn and winter, when it’s darkest. it’s good for the local hotels because tourists come all year round now.”wise agrees that northumberland needs to do more to take advantage of its dark skies, which are very rare. he believes the region needs more observatories to make sure that visitors will see what they came for. a new £14-million national landscape discovery centre will have an observatory when it is completed in a couple of years.fildes has big ambitions. he is planning britain’s first “astrovillage” – it would have the largest public observatory in the world, a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes. the multimillion-pound project would also have a hotel and attract 100,000 visitors a year – that is four times the number that are currently able to use the observatory.however, northumberland has competition. galloway forest park in scotland also has dark sky park status. exmoor in south-west england became europe’s first international dark sky reserve – one level below dark sky park – in 2011. a number of local businesses there now offer stargazing holidays. the uk is not as good as northern chile, which has more than ten tourist observatories and some of the clearest skies in the world.so, why do people want to look at the night sky? the media have helped. tv programmes about astronomy have attracted a new generation of stargazers. technology has also made astronomy more popular. apps such as stellarium now turn smartphones into pocket-size planetariums. but fildes believes that, most importantly, people are starting to appreciate the sky. “if you had to build a visitor attraction from the beginning, what could be better than the universe?”nan
elementary	on the market square in rjukan stands a statue of the person who created the town, a norwegian engineer and businessman called sam eyde. the great man looks north across the square at the side of a mountain in front of him.behind him, to the south, is the 1,800-metre mountain known as gaustatoppen. between the mountains, along the narrow vestfjord valley, is the small town that eyde built at the beginning of the last century for his factory workers.eyde used the power of the 100-metre rjukanfossen waterfall to make hydroelectricity in what was, at that time, the world’s biggest power plant.but one thing he couldn’t do was change the sun. deep in its east–west valley, with high mountains all around, rjukan and the 3,400 people who live there are in shadow for half the year. in the daytime, from late september to mid-march, the town, three hours north-west of oslo, is not completely dark, but it’s certainly not bright.now, high on the mountain opposite eyde’s statue, 450 metres above the town, three large, solar-powered, computer-controlled mirrors follow the movement of the sun across the sky. they reflect the sunshine down on to the square and fill it in bright sunlight.“it’s the sun!” says ingrid sparbo – she lifts her face to the light and closes her eyes. sparbo has lived all her life in rjukan and says, “this is so warming. not just physically, but mentally. it’s mentally warming.”two young mothers bring their children into the square and stand in the sun. on a freezing day, an elderly couple sit on one of the new benches and they smile at the warmth on their faces. children smile. lots of people take photographs. a shop assistant, silje johansen, says it’s “awesome. just awesome.”electrical engineer eivind toreid says “it’s a funny thing. not real sunlight, but very similar. like a spotlight.”heidi fieldheim says she heard all about it on the radio. “this will bring much happiness,” she says.across the road, in the nye tider café, sits the man who created this happiness. martin andersen is a 40-year-old artist who moved to rjukan in the summer of 2001.andersen had the idea for an artwork he calls the solspeil, or sun mirror, at the end of september one year: “every day, we took our young child for a walk,” he says, “and, every day, i realized we had to go a little further down the valley to find the sun.” by 28 september, the sun completely disappears from rjukan’s market square. it doesn’t reappear until 12 march.in the months between september and march, andersen says: “we would look up and see blue sky above, and the sun high on the mountain, but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town.”twelve years after he first dreamed of his solspeil, a german company that specializes in csp – concentrated solar power – brought in, by helicopter, the three 17-square-metre glass mirrors that are now high above the market square in rjukan.and it really works. some people were against the mirrors at first, but now even they agree that it works“i was strongly against it,” says nils eggerud. like many others, he felt they needed the money for other things – for extra carers to look after rjukan’s old people, perhaps, or better schools, cycle paths and roads.“and i still don’t know about the maintenance costs,” he says. “what will they be, who will pay them? but ... well, it feels nice, standing here. and, really, you just have to look at the people’s faces.”in his office with a view of the square, rjukan’s young mayor, steinar bergsland, is less interested in the cost and more interested in the benefits the mirrors might bring to the town.already, bergsland says, there are more visitors than usual and rjukan’s shopkeepers are making more money than usual.the town had to pay just 1 million krone – £100,000 – of the mirror’s total 5-million krone cost. the rest came from the government and a local business. “and”, says bergsland, “just look out of the window. look at those happy faces. now it’s here, people love it.”nan
elementary	a team at leicester university has told the world that the body they found under a local car park is the body of king richard iii. there were cheers when richard buckley, leader of the team of archaeologists, finally said that they were certain they had found the body of the king.the evidence is very strong. the scientists who did the dna tests, the people who created the computer-imaging technology to look at the bones in extraordinary detail, the genealogists who found a distant descendant with matching dna, and the academics who read old texts looking for accounts of the king’s death and burial all gave their findings.work has started on designing a new tomb in leicester cathedral, only 100 yards from the excavation site. there will be a ceremony to lay him into his new grave there, probably next year. leicester’s museums’ service is working on plans for a new visitor centre in an old school building next to the site.richard died at the battle of bosworth on 22 august 1485, the last english king to die in battle. the researchers revealed how he died for the first time. one picture showed the bottom of his skull cut off by one terrible hit, probably from a razor-sharp iron axe. the axe probably went several centimetres into his brain and, experts say, he would have been unconscious at once and dead very soon.the injury confirms the story that he died in the middle of the battle without his horse. in shakespeare’s play, he cries: “a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!” another hit with a sword, which also went through the bone and into the brain, would also have killed him. but many of the other injuries were after death, which suggests that the king’s naked body was mutilated as it was brought back to leicester.one terrible injury was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour. it suggests the story that his naked corpse was brought back on a horse and mutilated is true. bob savage, a medieval weapons expert, said it was probably not a war weapon. it was probably the sort of sharp knife a workman normally carried.michael ibsen, identified as the descendant of richard’s sister, was shocked when he heard the confirmation on sunday. “my head is still not clear now,” he said. “many, many hundreds of people died on that field that day. he was a king, but just one of the dead. he lived in very violent times and these deaths would not have been pretty or quick.”it was mathew morris who first found the body, in the first hour of the first day of the excavation. at first, he did not believe it was the king. he was digging in the car park, a place that local historians and the richard iii society said was probably the site of the lost church of grey friars. the priests of grey friars were brave – they took the body of the king and buried him in their church.ten days later, on 5 september, when more excavation proved morris had found the right place, he returned with lin foxhall, head of the archaeology department, to excavate the body. “we did it the usual way, lifting the arms, legs and skull first, and then we lifted the torso – so it was only when we finally saw the twisted spine that i thought: ‘my word, i think we’ve found him.’”for philippa langley of the richard iii society, richard was the true king, the last king of the north, a worthy and brave leader who was a victim of shakespeare’s negative propaganda. many people still believe he killed the little princes in the tower: the child edward v and his brother richard, were kept as prisoners in the tower of london when richard iii became king and they were never seen alive again. some bones were found at the tower centuries later, but it is not certain they are the princes’. there may be a need for more dna detective work there.nannan
elementary	the moroccan city of ouarzazate is on the edge of the sahara desert. it is now the centre for four linked solar mega-plants. the plants, together with hydro and wind, will give morocco, in north africa, nearly half of its electricity from renewable energy by 2020. the project is a key part of moroccoõs plans to use its deserts to become a global solar superpower.when the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world. the  rst phase, called noor 1, will be ready in november 2015. the mirror technology it uses is more expensive than the solar panels that we can see on roofs all over the world but it will be able to produce power even after the sun goes down.people have known for many years that the desert is a useful place to produce solar energy. in 1986, the german scientist gerhard knies said that the worldõs deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to make power for all the people in the world for a whole year. but the challenge is to capture that energy and take it to where it is needed.at noor 1, there are 500,000 moon-shaped solar mirrors. the 800 rows of mirrors follow the sun across the sky. they whir quietly every few minutes.when they are  nished, the four plants at ouarzazate will be as big as moroccoõs capital city, rabat, and make 580 mega-watts of electricity, enough for a million homes.solar energy will make up a third of moroccoõs renewable energy supply by 2020. wind and hydro will make up the other two-thirds.òwe are very proud of this project,ó moroccoõs environment minister, hakima el-haite said. òi think it is the most important solar plant in the world.óthe noor 2 and 3 plants, which are planned to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours. this will mean that there could be solar energy available 24/7 in the sahara and the rest of the region.òwe are already involved in transportation lines to take energy to the south of morocco and mauritania,ó says ahmed baroudi, manager of the national renewable energy investment company. but he says the project will go further ð even as far as the middle east.exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the moroccan solar energy agency (masen). morocco is making plans with tunisia and they hope to export energy north across the mediterranean, too.òwe believe that itõs possible to export energy to europe but,  rst, we have to build the connections, which donõt yet exist,ó said maha el-kadiri, a masen spokeswoman.until that time, the solar energy will be used in morocco. they might one day use solar energy to remove salt from sea water.nannannannannannannannannannannannannan
elementary	at the beginning of the final series of the tv programme, downton abbey, there is a feeling of sadness and everyone knows things are changing. the year is 1925 and downton abbey’s neighbours are selling their stately home. at downton abbey, lord grantham wants to reduce the number of servants.the real downton abbey is highclere castle – a stately home owned by george herbert, 8th earl of carnarvon. at highclere castle, they have more money than before. lady fiona carnarvon says that the huge success of downton all around the world has paid for building repairs at the castle.“it’s been an amazing magic carpet ride for all of us,” she said. “i’m very grateful. my husband and i love highclere castle. now, millions of other people love it.”at the moment, they only use the ground floor and first floor of highclere, on the borders of hampshire. but, a restoration project of tower rooms has begun. when it is finished, visitors will be able to climb up into the tower to an exhibition of the work of the architect of the houses of parliament, sir charles barry, who also rebuilt highclere castle between 1839 and 1842.in 2009, when the downton abbey producers first asked about filming at highclere castle, the castle needed £12 million of repairs. “it was just after the banking crisis and we were worried. then, downton began and highclere became a major tourist attraction.”the number of visitors doubled, to 1,200 a day, after downton abbey, written by julian fellowes, was shown around the world. it was a hit in the uk in 2010 and, then, in the us. it is now shown on television in 250 countries.the downton tourists are part of a growing phenomenon. the organization, visitbritain, says that nearly 30% of foreign visitors, nearly nine million people, visit castles and historic houses. almost half of visitors to britain now say they want to visit places from films or tv.more than a million tourists take a tour of historic buildings each year and they spend more than £1 billion. fifty-one per cent of brazilians, 42% of russians and chinese, and 35% of indian visitors will probably include a visit to a site of interest in their trips.visitbritain’s director, patricia yates, said: “the links between tourism, films and tv are strong.” she added that period dramas, like downton abbey, have also made places outside of london more popular.“downton abbey expresses a certain view of britain. it is a fantasy world, based in a particular time in history. it’s the first tv period drama that everyone knows and talks about.”lady carnarvon says that the long-term future of highclere might not be secure. but, she says, “the programme has allowed us to spend faster on the buildings.”highclere castle plans a tutankhamun event in 2022, 100 years after the 5th earl of carnarvon went to egypt with howard carter and discovered tutankhamun’s tomb. another event is the 300th anniversary of the birth of lancelot “capability” brown, who designed the grounds.“every single day, don’t take anything for granted,” said lady carnarvon. “you have to invest in these great houses. i’ve tried to show people it is fun. we have special events, not just a walk around a dusty house.”nannannannannan
advanced	they call it the richie rich club and it is about to get even richer. india’s wealthiest will quadruple their net worth between now and 2018, a report says, with hundreds of thousands of new entrepreneurs and inheritors becoming multimillionaires. the survey, based on interviews with 150 ultra-high-net-worth individuals, comes amid signs of returning business confidence in the world’s biggest democracy.recent years have seen lacklustre growth, rising prices of basic foodstuffs and a weakening currency. but the bharatiya janata party (bjp) won a landslide victory in may 2014 on a pledge to reinvigorate the ailing economy. despite the slowdown, there are nearly a sixth more indians worth in excess of $3.75m than in 2013, the report for the kotak mahindra bank notes. “cities are mushrooming, the middle class population growing, opportunities have increased manyfold and the political environment has improved greatly in recent months,” according to murali balaraman, a co-author.between them, india’s rich hold assets worth a trillion dollars, which is around a fifth of the total wealth in the country. by 2018, that total is likely to reach $4tn, the report says, making three times as many people multimillionaires.serving the new rich – and the old money – is a booming luxury market. “they really want to show or talk about their wealth in a really subtle way and consumption of luxury goods is a nice way to do it,” balaraman said. abhay gupta, the ceo of brand consultancy luxury connect, said the market for top-end goods and experiences would “only get bigger”. “there is a huge aspirational class who look up to what the very wealthy are doing and then copy it,” he said.cars are among the most popular items bought, the report says. whereas, in 2009, locally made suvs were shown off by the wealthy, now only foreign cars will turn heads. mercedes saw a 47% surge in sales in india in 2013. bmw has launched a new $200,000 model in delhi.india’s appalling infrastructure restricts demand, however. lamborghini’s chief executive, stephan winkelmann, admitted, in 2013, that the traffic and roads in india “are not so suitable” for the $450,000 sports cars. in india, lamborghini sells two models: the gallardo and the aventador, which has a top speed of 217mph. winkelmann said lamborghini’s indian customers were much younger than those in europe, with a typical buyer being in his 30s. however, the most popular investments remain real estate – mainly within india – and jewellery.india’s super-rich have long raised eyebrows around the world with their spectacular spending. mukesh ambani, the country’s wealthiest man, has built the world’s most valuable home in mumbai, the commercial capital. the 27-storey tower, complete with helicopter pads, indoor cinemas and a staff of more than 600, is worth an estimated $1bn.the three-day wedding of the niece of lakshmi mittal, the uk-based steel tycoon who is worth an estimated $16bn, was reported to have cost $80m. hundreds of guests were flown to barcelona for the ceremony and party, which took place in a museum in the city.but buyers of luxury goods searching for the psychological satisfaction of exclusivity are becoming increasingly demanding, the kotak mahindra report says. one ordered nine cases of japanese whisky costing over $750 a bottle for a wedding reception. the attraction of the imported whisky was that no one who attended the wedding would find out how to source the same drink in india, the report adds. another big spender systematically bought identical pairs of louis vuitton bags, then cut up half of them to make clothes that would match her accessories.even the traditional wedding is evolving fast. presents such as silver plates, dried fruit or sweets once sent with wedding invitations are being replaced by gifts by top western designer brands. “these days, it’s rolex watches and louis vuitton bags,” says gupta.almost half new ultra-high-net-worth individuals live in smaller provincial cities. a high proportion give substantial amounts to charity, though the report notes that the “growth of philanthropic spends in india has not been proportional to overall growth in ultra-high-net-worth individual wealth”.co-author balaraman says that growth in the number of rich people would not result in social tensions as a wide gap in incomes and wealth is an “accepted norm” in india. “people know that someone is rich and someone is poor and they carry on with their lives,” he explains.
advanced	robert mys_ajek stops dead. between two paw prints on a muddy mountain track, the scientist  nds what he is looking for. òdroppings!õõ he enthuses. wolf sightings are so rare that the sighting of their faeces marks a good day, even for a seasoned tracker.but it is getting easier. there are now an estimated 1,500 wolves in poland. the number has doubled in 15 years. wolves are ð along with the brown bear, the lynx and the wolverine ð europeõs last large predator carnivores. conservationists from britain, germany and the netherlands are beating a path here to  nd out how the country has saved this protected species, slandered even in fairy tales.bits of bone and hair protrude from the precious black faeces. òit ate a red deer,õõ says the university of warsaw biologist. òin my lab, i can tell you all about this wolf ð not only its diet but its gender, sexual habits, age, state of health and family connections.õõdna tests have established that polish wolves are travellers. òone wolf reached the netherlands, where unfortunately it was hit by a car. they have a tremendous range. they need space. the average territory required by a polish pack is 250 sq km,õõ said mys_ajek.òis there any prospect of our ever being able to reintroduce wolves to scotland?õõ asks student alex entwisle, 23, on a  eld trip to southern poland from his college in the uk. the animal science students have spent the day observing droppings and paw prints in the spruce-clad beskidy mountains of the polish carpathians.their hot discussion topic is whether to reintroduce wolves to the british isles for the  rst time since the 18th century.as the guest of a british charity, the wolves and humans foundation, mys_ajek toured the scottish highlands in 2015 and took questions from villagers about the polish experience. òthe big difference between scotland and poland is that we eat pork. we do not have many sheep here.òthe similarity is that we have a lot of animals ð 300,000 red deer and more than 800,000 roe deer. in poland, we also have a massive overpopulation of wild boar ð about 200,000 ð and these are ravaging farmersõ cereal crops. here, wolves are part of the solution,õõ he says.the scientist, who is a familiar face on polish television, says wolves are exceptional animals that are capable of moving up to 30km during a single hunt. òthe beskidy pack is a strong unit, eight or nine individuals. this year, we have recorded  ve cubs, two yearlings and two adults.òwe track them using motion-activated cameras in the forest and by following their prints in the mud and snow. in each family group, only one pair reproduces, once a year. all pack members care for the young with solidarity and devotion.õõmys_ajek, the son of a shepherd, is puzzled by wolvesõ bad reputation. òwhy does one speak of a ôlone-wolf gunmanõ? why did we have to have little red riding hood?õhe is fascinated by these aloof canines who remained in the wild 33,000 years ago when others decided on a much more comfortable existence as domestic dogs.wolves are not pooches. mys_ajek says only scienti c arguments ð the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population ð can save europeõs wild carnivores, especially the unpopular wolf. ònatural predators balance the ecosystem. they keep herbivores in check, thus allowing trees to grow tall for birds to nest in.õõshoot the deer? òit is only a partial solution,õõ he says. òin a diverse environment, you have the so-called ôlandscape of fearõ, where herbivores no longer spend all day grazing on the tender riverside grass. they move away, as a precaution, to avoid being trapped by a predator. this gives the vegetation a chance.õõthe ban on wolf hunting in the western carpathians came into force in 1995 and nationwide in poland in 1998. there are now resident packs in virtually all the countryõs major forests. the predators coexist with humans rather than being fenced off, as they are in african safari parks.the polish government pays compensation for livestock killed by wolves. mys_ajek advises farmers on erecting electric fences. he has helped revive the use of two deterrents that, for reasons no one quite understands, wolves  nd particularly scary: red bunting (hung around sheep pens) and the bark of the  uffy white tatra mountain sheepdogthe survival and mobility of polandõs wolves has been helped by the countryõs belated infrastructure development. in 1989, when the communists relinquished power, poland had only one motorway. major road projects ð requiring wildlife impact studies ð began after poland joined the european union in 2004. the country now has one of the highest densities in the world of overhead crossings and underpasses for wild animals.attitudes have also changed. òfor many years, hunting was cultural. in 1975, there were fewer than 100 wolves in poland. beginning in the 1950s, hunting wolves had been encouraged by the authorities. they paid a reward for killing a wolf worth a monthõs salary. it was carnage.õõmys_ajek says the improvement in polish wolvesõ survival chances has been considerable but remains fragile. packs are mobile across borders and hunting still goes on in neighbouring russia, lithuania, belarus, ukraine and slovakia.he claims polandõs new government, elected in october 2015, is hostile to wolves. òthe environment minister, jan szyszko, makes no secret of being a hunter. there are 120,000 licensed hunters in poland and they are in uential in parliament.òthe hunters claim wolves are a pest and that there are 4,000 of them in poland, which is a spurious  gure based on an unscienti c count. this government is capable of turning back the clock.õõbeing a wolf advocate is not easy. òit is not as if you can argue to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction. most tourists want to see the animals but wolves stay away from humans. they have a tremendously sensitive sense of smell.õõthe 12 british animal science students leave the polish carpathians without a wolf sighting; just photographs of paw prints and droppings. entwisle is convinced that scotland will never be able to match polandõs success.òit would be amazing for the environment to have them back because of the problem of too many deer. but it would just not be viable because of the roads and sheep.òthere would be problems with farmers. we had our industrial revolution too long ago. we ruined it for ourselves. in britain, we like predators to be far away and to watch them on television,õõ said entwisle.
advanced	lots of us know we are sleep-deprived but imagine if we could  x it with a fairly simple solution: getting up later. in a speech at the british science festival, dr paul kelley, clinical research associate at the sleep and circadian neuroscience institute at oxford university, called for schools to stagger their starting times to work with the natural biological rhythms of their students. it would improve cognitive performance, exam results and studentsõ health (sleep deprivation has been linked with diabetes, depression, obesity and an impaired immune system).it follows a paper, published in 2014, in which he noted that, when children are around ten, their biological wake-up time is about 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and, at 18, someone you may think of as a lazy teenager actually has a natural waking hour of 9am. the conventional school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not 16- to 18-year-olds. for the older teenagers, it might be more sensible to start the school day at 11am or even later. òa 7am alarm call for older adolescents,ó kelley and his colleagues pointed out in the paper, òis the equivalent of a 4.30am start for a teacher in their 50s.óhe says itõs not as simple as persuading teenagers to go to bed earlier. òthe bodyõs natural rhythm is controlled by a particular kind of light,ó says kelley. òthe eye doesnõt just contain rods and cones; it contains cells that then report to the suprachiasmatic nuclei in the hypothalamus.ó this part of the brain controls our circadian rhythms over a 24-hour cycle. òitõs the light that controls it. itõs like saying: ôwhy canõt you control your heartbeat?õóbut it isnõt just students who would bene t from a later start. kelley says the working day should be more forgiving of our natural rhythms. describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: òbetween 14 and 24, itõs more than two hours. for people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35, itõs about an hour and a half. that can continue up until youõre about 55 when itõs in balance again. the 10-year-old and 55-year-old wake and sleep naturally at the same time.óthis might be why, he adds, the traditional nine to  ve is so ingrained; it is maintained by bosses, many of them in their mid-50s and upwards because òit is best for themó. so, should workplaces have staggered starting times, too? should those in their 50s and above come in at 8am, while those in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage intern or apprentice be encouraged to turn up at 11am? kelley says that synchronized hours could have òmany positive consequences. the positive side of this is peopleõs performance, mood and health will improve. itõs very uplifting in a way because itõs a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.óthere would probably be fewer accidents as drivers would be more alert, he says. it could spell the end of rush hour as people stagger their work and school-run times. a later start to the day for many, says kelley, òis something that would bene t everyone, particularly families. parents go and try to wake up teenagers who are waking up three hours too early. it creates tensions for everybody.óso, what time does kelley start work? òi am 67 so that means iõm back to being ten years old and i get up just after six. i wake naturally.ó and, yes, he says he  nds the start of his working day much easier now than he did when he was younger.

òthere is guilt over being rich in the  rst place,ó he said. òthere is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich. and, then, there is the isolation ð being in the 1%, it turns out, can be lonely.ó it seems f scott fitzgerald was right: the very rich òare different from you and meó.counsellors argue things have become worse since the  nancial crisis and the debate over income inequality that has been spurred on by movements like occupy wall street and the fight for $15 fair wage campaign.òthe occupy wall street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% and painted them globally as something negative,ó said jamie traeger-muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the wealth legacy group. the media, she said, is partly to blame for making the rich òfeel like they need to hide or feel ashamedó.traeger-muney runs a global  rm and specializes in working with inheritors, who often get a bad reputation in the press. òyou can come up with lots of words and sayings about inheritors ð not one of them is positive: spoilt brat, born with a silver spoon in their mouth, trust-fund babies, all these things,ó she said, adding that itõs òeasy to scapegoat the richó.òsometimes, i am shocked by things that people say. you would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealth holders.óòitõs really isolating to have a lot of money. peopleõs reactions to you can be scary,ó said barbara nusbaum, an expert in money psychology. òwe are all taught not to talk about money. itõs not polite to talk about money. ironically, itõs harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money. itõs much more socially acceptable to say ôi am broke. things are hard.õ you canõt say ôi have a ton of money.õ you have to keep a lot of your life private.óas a result, cockrell points out, the rich tend to hang out with other rich americans, not out of snobbery but in order to be around those who understand them and their problems.the growing gap between the rich and poor is a global phenomenon. according to oxfam, the richest 1% have seen their share of global wealth increase from 44% in 2009 to 48% in 2014 and are on track to own more than the other 99% by 2016.in the us, over the last three decades, the wealth owned by the top 0.1% households increased from 7% to 22% even as the wealth of the bottom 90% of households declined.the number of extremely wealthy people has also been climbing. according to research from spectrem group, in 2014, the number of us households with $1m or more in assets ð excluding the value of their primary home ð increased by 500,000 to 10.1m. in 2007, that number was 9.2m. households worth $5m or more reached 1.3m and 142,000 households are now worth $25m or more.since the 2008  nancial crisis, the income gap has expanded and the situation òhas gotten worse for the wealthyó, cockrell said. the main reason? not knowing if your friends are friends with you or your money.òsomeone else who is also a billionaire ð they donõt want anything from you. never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means, i think that is dif cult,ó said cockrell. òas the gap has widened, the rich have become more and more isolated.""these are real fears faced by the richest of the rich. in 2007, the gates foundation teamed up with boston collegeõs center on wealth and philanthropy to document what it felt like to be in americaõs 1%. for the next four years, researchers surveyed 165 of americaõs richest households ð 120 of those households have at least $25m in assets. the average net worth of those surveyed was $78m. the resulting study, the joys and dilemmas of wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old adage that money canõt buy happiness.òwealth can be a barrier to connecting with other people,ó confessed a spouse of a tech entrepreneur who made about $80m. some americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret. òwe talk about it as stealth wealth. there are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment,ó said traeger-muney. if wealthy americans talk about the unique challenges that come with their wealth, people often dismiss their experience.òpeople say ôoh, poor you.õ there is not a lot of sympathy there,ó she said. òwealth is still one of our last taboos.óspeaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to spill all your worries, cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money de ne them.òi donõt think itõs healthy to discount your problems. if you are part of the 1%, you still have problems and they are legitimate to you. even when you say, ôi donõt have to struggle for moneyõ, there are other parts of your life. money is not the only thing that de nes you,ó he said. òyour problems are legitimate.ó"
advanced	dame sally davies, the chief medical officer for england, has likened the problem of antibiotic resistance to the risks presented by international terrorism. while this might sound like an exaggeration, the threat was actually, if anything, understated. each year, the global number of deaths to which bacterial resistance contributes far outstrips those caused by terrorist attacks.while it is difficult to track the global impact of antibiotic resistance across all bacterial species, the world health organization estimates that for tuberculosis alone multi-drug resistance accounts for more than 150,000 deaths each year. antibiotic resistance is no longer an abstract risk: this is now a war.in the past hundred years, our expectations of life and survival have changed beyond all recognition. at the beginning of the twentieth century, life expectancy in the uk stood at around 47 years of age for a man and 50 for a woman, a number heavily affected by the very high rate of infant mortality in those days. around a third of all deaths occurred in children under the age of five, largely because of infectious disease.in contrast, a child born in britain today has a better than one in four chance of reaching their 100th birthday. for this we have public health systems, vaccination and antibiotics to thank. it is by these means – the prevention and treatment of illnesses caused by microorganisms – that the real war against disease is principally won.elsewhere, we have pushed the limits of survival, notably in intensive care. this, the specialism in which i chose to train, is where antibiotic resistant organisms are most prevalent. here, powerful antibiotics, essential in the treatment of life-threatening illness, are used routinely. these drugs decimate ordinary bacteria. but what they leave behind are hardy species that have begun to learn tricks that allow them to evade antibiotic drugs.as a newly qualified doctor in the late 1990s, i learnt about methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus – the infamous mrsa – a bacterial species resistant to methicillin and all other penicillins. in the fight against it, there were a handful of exotic-sounding drugs – vancomycin and teicoplanin among them. these were supposed to be our last lines of defence, but antibiotic resistant bacteria became more and more common; as did species with new patterns of resistance. drugs we had previously barely heard of became commonplace. new last-line drugs emerged to replace the old. we got used to this state of affairs; a steady escalation in the arms race between us and the bacteria.but the balance has been shifting steadily. in our hospitals and our gp surgeries we have abused the drugs that gave us such a huge advantage over infectious disease, using them too often and too indiscriminately. and some of the worst abuses have occurred outside of healthcare, with antibiotics introduced into the food chain, through agriculture and the lacing of livestock feed with anti-bacterial drugs. we assumed that antibiotic therapy was an advantage we could enjoy forever. we became complacent that the pharmaceutical industry would continue to stay ahead of the game.but this is no longer the case. new, more resistant species have been identified. the vancomycin that we used to rely on to treat mrsa infection was defeated. vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa) emerged in our hospitals. and other bacterial species were learning the same trick. enterobacteria, organisms usually found in the gut, had also acquired vancomycin resistance. today, infections with formidable, highly resistant organisms are commonplace and the pharmaceutical industry is not keeping pace. fewer and fewer new anti-microbial drugs are emerging from their production lines. it is becoming increasingly difficult to develop new drugs active against resistant strains. for every method of attack the pharmaceutical companies invent, bacteria rapidly evolve a defence. all of the simple approaches to the problem have been exhausted. antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop, that are only used in short courses and that quickly become ineffective due to the evolution of bacterial resistance. consequently, the pharmaceutical industry’s incentive to manufacture new drugs that can fight them is low.almost as soon as antibiotic use became widespread in the 1940s, the first evidence of bacteria resistance to antimicrobial therapy emerged. initially, these were little more than curiosities. when they did infect patients, the numbers were so small that at first they were not enough to warrant much attention. but today, they have become a fact of medical life. less than a century after the discovery of penicillin, we are beginning to lose the fight.since the first mrsa deaths in otherwise healthy children in the us in 1998, the number of deaths from mrsa infection in the us each year has risen to tens of thousands – outstripping the number of deaths caused by aids. bacterial resistance in hospitals is everywhere you look. this is a war like no other. there needs to be cultural change in our prescribing behaviours and more restraint in the use of antibiotics in farming and agriculture. and somehow, the pharmaceutical companies have to be convinced to chase the development of these less profitable drugs.within my working lifetime, the pattern of antibiotic resistance in healthcare has transformed from a rare but notable event to a problem of epidemic proportion. if we are to avoid a return to the pre-antibiotic time with all its excess mortality, we must be bold. to squander the advantage we have so recently gained against microorganisms in the fight for life would be unthinkable.nannan

advanced	ever since he was diagnosed hiv positive, moses king, 48, has had one major problem. he has been able to cope with the stigma of being hiv positive – widespread in liberia – and he was able to access antiretroviral medication, provided by the global fund to fight aids, tuberculosis and malaria and distributed by the liberian government. but king and his family of six children could not get the right food to eat. a subsistence farmer, he grew vegetables and bought rice. but meat and fish – expensive, luxury products in liberian markets but essential sources of protein – remained elusive.“subsistence farming allowed us to survive, but we had so many problems,” said king. “we could not get any protein, and we were not getting the nutrients we needed to sustain ourselves.”pate k chon, a counsellor who works with hiv sufferers in liberia, provided an unlikely solution. since watching a documentary about a fish farm in thailand several years earlier, she had thought of setting up a similar project in liberia, enabling hiv sufferers to have work and also access a stable source of protein.“i saw this film about fish in a cement pool and i thought it was a good idea,” said chon, herself diagnosed with hiv in 1992. “so many of the people i work with don’t have the means to have a balanced protein diet and fish is such a clean source of protein – it doesn’t cause health problems like other sources, and it is something we can farm.”chon, founder of a faith-based ngo, began building a pool in which to farm fish. in june 2012, chon met john sheehy, a ‘strategic philanthropist’ and founder of consultancy emerging business lab, who raised money for the non-profit fish farm in the northeast of monrovia, liberia’s capital, and set about learning aquaculture, doing an online course through cornell university and speaking to other fish farmers in africa.“i raised the money and built the farm, learned the proper tank layout and water flow system,” said sheehy. “a lot of my knowledge was self-taught, and now i would love to be able to write a manual and share it with other people,” he added.the project has now grown into the grow2feed liberia fish farm, with 12 tanks, which, when fully stocked, will each have 5,000 fish – providing up to 200,000 fish per year, serving a community of 1,200 predominantly hiv-positive people, including king and his family.in addition to the fish, waste from the tanks is collected and used to irrigate crops, also providing food and income for the community, made up of 503 women, 206 men and 346 children.“the members of the community live near the farm, and have agreed to be part of the co-operative,” said sheehy. “many work on the farm, or tending the crops, and what they get in return – when the fish are fully grown after 90 days – is fish. they can use those fish to feed themselves and to sell in the market so that they get money to buy other staple items.“the fish farm gives these people with hiv a way of getting back into society – now they are bartering and trading with people in the market every week.”according to liberia’s demographic health survey, 1.5% of liberia’s 3.5 million people are hiv positive, with 60% of those women or girls. stigma and discrimination still surround the illness, and have led to around half of all cases in the country going untreated.good nutrition is particularly important for people with hiv. research has shown they need much higher levels of protein to prevent their health from deteriorating and to allow healthy growth. “nutrition is one of the key things if you are taking antiretroviral drugs,” said chon. “the drugs are toxic and, if you don’t have food to eat, they can make you very ill. but food in liberia is very expensive. we buy expensive imported rice, even though we should be growing it ourselves and fish is difficult for most people to afford.”sheehy says grow2feed is the first co-operative fish farm in liberia to operate for the benefit of an hiv-positive community. the project has attracted the interest of the liberian government, and the un food and agriculture organization, which has worked with grow2feed to provide training, will also support teaching at the university of liberia.fish farming experts say the practice has huge potential in africa.“fish farming is absolutely viable in africa,” said paul white, owner of the hydrofish fish farm in ivory coast, which produces 3,000 tonnes of fish each year. “a lot of the fish on the market comes from china and is imported frozen. it is of a quality that could never enter europe or america. there has been a serious lack of investment and a lack of know-how in fish production. it is all coming to the forefront now,” he added.some critics are sceptical of farmed fish, citing inbred fish and high levels of toxins. but sheehy said good practice mitigated these problems. “a lot of farmed fish is inbred, which does cause problems, but we are using a process with local fish sourced in liberia, not fish from another region,” said sheehy. “that means we can continue using local fish to bring in new broodstock. “and we are not using lakes that are cornered off, where the fish absorb all the toxins in the lake. we can control the environment using the tanks, and we test the water and monitor it constantly.sheehy hopes to replicate the model throughout liberia and the region. “a rice-growing co-op in sierra leone asked us if we could do this on our property so that they can feed their workers and we have had interest from nigeria and central america,” said sheehy. “but we operate 100% non-profit and we will never lose our social justice aspect.”
advanced	organic food has more of the antioxidant compounds linked to better health than regular food, and lower levels of toxic metals and pesticides, according to the most comprehensive scienti c analysis to date. the international team behind the work suggests that switching to organic fruit and vegetables could give the same bene ts as adding one or two portions of the recommended ô ve a dayõ.the team, led by professor carlo leifert at newcastle university, concludes that there are òstatistically signi cant, meaningfuló differences, with a range of antioxidants being òsubstantially higheró ð between 19% and 69% ð in organic food. it is the  rst study to demonstrate clear and wide-ranging differences between organic and conventional fruits, vegetables and cereals.the researchers say the increased levels of antioxidants are equivalent to òone to two of the  ve portions of fruits and vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be signi cant and meaningful in terms of human nutrition, if information linking these compounds to the health bene ts associated with increased fruit, vegetable and wholegrain consumption is con rmedó.the  ndings will add to the controversy over organic food and whether it is better for people, with one expert saying that the  ndings were exaggerated. tom sanders, a professor of nutrition at kingõs college london, said the research did show some differences. òbut the question is are they within natural variation? and are they nutritionally relevant? i am not convinced.ó he said leifertõs work had caused controversy in the past. òleifert has had a lot of disagreements with a lot of people.ó sanders added the research showed organic cereals have less protein than conventional crops.the results of the research are based on an analysis of 343 peer-reviewed studies from around the world ð more than ever before ð which examine differences between organic and conventional fruit, vegetables and cereals. òthe crucially important thing about this research is that it shatters the myth that how we farm does not affect the quality of the food we eat,ó said helen browning, chief executive of the soil association, which campaigns for organic farming.plants produce many of their antioxidant compounds to  ght back against pest attacks, so the higher levels in organic crops may result from their lack of protection by chemical sprays. but, the scientists say other reasons may be important, such as organic varieties being bred for toughness and not being overfed with arti cial fertilizers.leifert and his colleagues conclude that many antioxidants òhave previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancersó. but, they also note that no long-term studies showing health bene ts from a broad organic diet have yet been conducted. the researchers found much higher levels of cadmium, a toxic metal, in conventional crops. pesticide residues were found on conventional crops four times more often than on organic food. the research was funded by the eu and an organic farming charity.the research is certain to be criticized: the inclusion of so many studies in the analysis could mean poor-quality work skews the results, although the team did òsensitivity analysesó and found that excluding weaker work did not signi cantly change the outcome. also, the higher levels of cadmium and pesticides in conventional produce were still well below regulatory limits. but, the researchers say cadmium accumulates over time in the body and that some people may wish to avoid this, and that pesticide limits are set individually, not for the cocktail of chemicals used on crops.a further criticism is that the differences seen may result from different climates, soil types and crop varieties, and not from organic farming, though the researchers argue that combining many studies should average out these other differences. the greatest criticism, however, will be over the suggestions of potential health bene ts. the most recent major analysis, which took in 223 studies in 2012, found little evidence. òthe published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are signi cantly more nutritious than conventional foods,ó it found.this was also the conclusion of earlier, smaller studies published in 2009 in a scienti c journal and by the uk food standards agency, though the latter considered just 11 studies. the 2012 study did note that eating organic food might help people avoid pesticide residues. sanders said he was not persuaded by the new work. òyou are not going to be better nourished if you eat organic food,ó he said. òwhat is most important is what you eat, not whether itõs organic or conventional. itõs whether you eat fruit and vegetables at all. people are buying into a lifestyle system. they get an assurance it is not being grown with chemicals and is not grown by big business.óopinion polls show healthy eating (55%) and avoiding chemical residues (53%) are key reasons cited by shoppers for buying organic produce. but, many also say care for the environment (44%) and animal welfare (31%) are important, as is taste (35%). browning said: òthis research backs up what people think about organic food. in other countries, there have long been much higher levels of support and acceptance of the bene ts of organic food and farming. we hope these  ndings will bring the uk into line with the rest of europe.ó
advanced	when you see the word amazon, what’s the first thing that springs to mind – the world’s biggest forest, the longest river or the largest internet retailer – and which do you consider most important?these questions have risen to the fore in an arcane, but hugely important, debate about how to redraw the boundaries of the internet. brazil and peru have lodged objections to a bid made by the us e-commerce giant for a prime new piece of cyberspace: “.amazon”.the seattle-based company has applied for its brand to be a top-level domain name (currently “.com”), but the south american governments argue this would prevent the use of this internet address for environmental protection, the promotion of indigenous rights and other public interest uses.along with dozens of other disputed claims to names, including “.patagonia” and “.shangrila”, the issue cuts to the heart of debates about the purpose and governance of the internet.until now, the differences between commercial, governmental and other types of identity were easily distinguished in every internet address by “.com”, “.gov” and 20 other categories.but these categories – or generic top-level domains (gtlds) as they are technically known – are about to undergo the biggest expansion since the start of the worldwide web.the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (icann) – a us-based non-profit organization that plays a key role in cyberspace governance – has received bids (each reportedly worth almost $200,000) for hundreds of new gtlds to add to the existing 22.amazon has applied for dozens of new domains, including “.shop”, “.song”, “.book” and “.kindle”. but its most contentious application is for its own brand.brazil and peru have called for the “.amazon” application to be withdrawn, saying a private company should not be assigned a name that denotes an important geographical area that spans their territories and is also used for certain regions and cross-border organizations.“allowing private companies to register geographical names as gtlds to reinforce their brand strategy or to profit from the meaning of these names does not serve, in our view, the public interest,” the brazilian ministry of science and technology said.brazil said its views were endorsed last month by other members of the amazon cooperation treaty (bolivia, colombia, ecuador, guyana, suriname and venezuela).dozens of other protests have also been registered over proposed top-level domains that take geographical, cultural or contested brand names.argentina has lodged an expression of its unhappiness that the us outdoor clothing retailer, patagonia, is claiming a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty that also has its own parliament. “argentina rejects the ‘.patagonia’ request for a new generic top-level domain,” the government notes in an appeal. “patagonia is a relevant region for the country’s economy because it has oil, fishing, mining and agriculture resources. it is also a region with a vibrant local community and it is a major tourist destination.”less convincingly, china has disputed the domain “.shangrila”, which is proposed by a hotel group of the same name. the authorities in beijing say the “shangri-la” label belongs to a region in yunnan province, although it was only renamed as such in 2001 (long after the hotel group was formed) so that the local community could cash in on the fame of the fictional paradise depicted in the novel, lost horizon, by british author james hilton.at a conference in april in beijing, icann’s governmental advisory committee – the primary voice of national governments within the institution – recommended a freeze on disputed proposals. they are expected to be discussed again at a meeting in durban in july. the first approved domain names should be in use before the end of 2013.

left for them by grateful customers. the government have announced a two-month consultation on proposals that they said would stamp out unfairness.among the reviewõs revelations was the fact that some waiters are charged up to a 15% administration fee on tips they are left by credit or debit cards. in some restaurants, the government has seen evidence of waiters being forced to hand over their own cash, if they donõt collect enough tips, to cover these fees. the government said it would consider prohibiting employers from charging workers an admin fee or any other deductions.the government also said that it wanted customers to know that tips are voluntary, calling for the system to be made more transparent, with restaurants clearly displaying their tips policy.we asked waiters around the uk what they think of the tipping process (including how much they take home from tips and whether itõs fair) and what would improve it for them.1. rodri, 37, london: ôaround 50% of a waiterõs income is tipsõ average tips: £60 per eight-hour shift i think they treat waiters best in ... the useverything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015. this is when it was revealed that dozens of restaurants were exposed for skimming tips from staff for administration fees. however, you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains. iõve heard of restaurants not paying their chefs a share of the tronc (a payment arrangement used to distribute tips). some restaurants will take 4% of all sales to pay the chefs and as an admin fee. so, if you sell £1,000 worth of food, the company will take £40. this is regardless of how much you make in tips. this means that if a table has a £100 bill and doesnõt tip, the waiter has to pay £4 of their own money. this leads to a money-grabbing culture and, ironically, to bad service. if a table doesnõt tip, the waiter feels as if they are being robbed by the company and ends up resenting the customers.i can average around £60 in tips per shift but, on a good night, this goes up to over £100 and, on a poor night, itõs around £40. around 50% of a waiterõs income is tips. all restaurants should have to publicly state their exact tipping procedure. america has it pretty good ð everyone tips.2. elle, 22, edinburgh: ôwe never know whether itõs fairõ average tips: £20 per eight-hour shift i think they treat waiters best in ... francei work three jobs, all on part-time zero-hours contracts, in catering and hospitality. my main day job is in a cafe_ where the small number of staff work both front of house and in the kitchen so all our tips get put in a pot and shared equally. my main evening job is at a restaurant where we donõt get our tips but our wages are minimum wage plus an extra £2.50 per hour (which apparently has been worked out to account for average tips when shared with the kitchen staff). my third job is events catering and nobody ever tips.in restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips through card payments, the staff never actually see how much is getting tipped ð so we donõt know whether weõre getting our fair share or not. the system seems better in france, where they donõt tip much but waiting tables is seen as a proper job, offering job security and a decent income.3. ashley, 22, london: ôtips go towards customer breakagesõ average tips: £10-15 per eight-hour shift i think they treat waiters best in ... australiai work in a south-east london pub in the evenings and i do day shifts at a local restaurant. in both places, tips are all collected and shared out at the end of the night. money is also taken from the tip jar to cover breakages by either staff or customers. if a member of the team gets off early, they will rarely see their tips because they are shared out just before the pub closes.it is incredibly unfair that our tips are shared out, especially when one member of the team underperforms. equally, when a member of the team does incredibly well, they donõt get what theyõve earned. itõs really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers. the managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips. i make around £20 a shift but would only be given £10-15 of that money.when i am tipped well, the tips hugely impact on my  nances. occasionally, i will earn over £50 in one night, which almost doubles my earnings for that day. however, i never get more than £30 of that money after it has been shared out. i really rely on tips because i am only paid £7 an hour.iõd rather we earned a good basic wage (like in australia) and therefore didnõt have to rely on tips to make ends meet.4. tom, manchester: ôa big night of tips can help pay the rentõ average tips: £40 per eight-hour shift i think they treat waiters best in ... italywhere i used to work,  oor staff kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips. the other 20% of cash went into a pot for the commis waiters and service bar. the 60% went into a tronc system, which helped boost kitchen salaries. iõm not actually sure if this was to help pay the agreed salary or provide bonuses.itõs hard to say how much i earned a shift; maybe around £40, £20 from card tips. it can make a massive change to your weekly  nances. sometimes, people needed a big night to be able to pay their rent.they have got tipping right in italy, where people donõt add a service charge but usually round up their bill so, if they get a meal for û19, they leave a û20 note and donõt ask for change. they respect the staff and you often see people making a career out of waiting and the experience shows.
