intermediate	water scientists have given one of the strongest warnings ever about global food supplies. they say that the world’s population may have to change almost completely to a vegetarian diet by 2050 to avoid catastrophic shortages.humans get about 20% of their protein from animal-based products now. however, this may need to decrease to just 5% to feed the extra two billion people expected to be alive by 2050, according to research by some of the world’s top water scientists.“there will not be enough water to produce food for the expected nine-billion population in 2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards diets common in western nations,” the report by malik falkenmark and colleagues at the stockholm international water institute (siwi) said.“there will be just enough water if the proportion of animal-based foods is limited to 5% of total calories.”warnings that water scarcity could limit food production come at the same time as oxfam and the un prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years. prices for items such as corn and wheat have risen nearly 50% on international markets since june. the price increase has been caused by severe droughts in the us and russia, and weak monsoon rains in asia. more than 18 million people are already facing serious food shortages across the sahel.oxfam says that the price increase will have a devastating effect in developing countries that rely heavily on food imports, including parts of latin america, north africa and the middle east. food shortages in 2008 led to fighting and riots in 28 countries.changing to a vegetarian diet is one way to increase the amount of water available to grow more food in a world where the climate is becoming increasingly erratic, the scientists said. animal protein-rich food uses five to ten times more water than a vegetarian diet. one third of the world’s arable land is used to grow crops to feed animals. other options to feed people include stopping waste and increasing trade between countries that have a food surplus and countries that don’t have enough food.“nine hundred million people already go hungry and two billion people are malnourished although per-capita food production continues to increase,” they said. “seventy per cent of all water is used in agriculture, and growing more food to feed an extra two billion people by 2050 will place greater pressure on water and land.”the report is being released at the start of the annual world water conference in stockholm, sweden, where 2,500 politicians, un groups, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries meet to discuss global water supply problems.competition for water between food production and other uses will increase pressure on essential resources, the scientists said. “the un predicts that we must increase food production by 70% by mid-century. this will put additional pressure on our water resources, which are already stressed, at a time when we also need more water to satisfy global energy demand and to create electricity for the 1.3 billion people who are without it,” said the report.overeating, malnourishment and waste are all increasing. “we will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future,” said the report’s editor, anders jägerskog.nannannannan
intermediate	the uk prime minister, david cameron, has declared a òclear resultó in the scottish independence referendum ð scotland voted by a 10.6-point margin against ending the 307-year- old union with england and wales. the prime minister promised a devolution revolution in great britain, as he welcomed scotlandõs decision to remain inside the uk. òthere can be no disputes, no reruns ð we have heard the will of the scottish people,ó he said in a statement.earlier, scotlandõs  rst minister, alex salmond, remained de ant at a scottish national party rally in edinburgh ð he said he accepted scotland had not, òat this stageó, decided to vote for independence. he said the referendum was a òtriumph for democratic politicsó and he would work with the government in london in the best interests of scotland and the rest of the uk. òwe have touched sections of the community who have never before been touched by politics,ó he said.the yes campaign won four big successes ð it won 53% of the vote in scotlandõs largest city, glasgow, 57% in dundee and 51% in north lanarkshire. however, the no campaign was victorious in 28 authorities. it won easily in areas where it was expected to do well, including edinburgh, aberdeenshire and borders, but also in areas that could have gone to the yes campaign, including the western isles. in the  nal count, the no camp won 2,001,926 votes (55.3%) and the yes camp won 1,617,989 votes (44.7%).in his speech, cameron made clear that there would be constitutional reforms, including in scotland, but not until after the general election. he also said that scottish measures would happen in tandem with changes in england. òwe have heard the voice of scotland and, now, the millions of voices of england must be heard,ó he said.cameron added: òthe people of scotland have spoken and it is a clear result. they have kept our country of four nations together and, like millions of other people, i am delighted. as i said during the campaign, it would have broken my heart to see our united kingdom come to an end. and i know that feeling was shared by people not just across our country but around the world because of what we have achieved together in the past and what we can do together in the future. so, now, it is time for our united kingdom to come together and to move forward. a vital part of that will be a balanced settlement, fair to people in scotland and, importantly, to everyone in england, wales and northern ireland as well.ed miliband, the leader of the labour party, said the referendum was a vote from the scottish people for change. òwe know our country needs to change. we will deliver stronger powers for a stronger scottish parliament, a strong scotland.ó but he said that would go beyond scotland. òwe will also meet the desire for change across england, across wales, across the whole of the united kingdom.ónick clegg, the deputy prime minister, said the referendum was ònot only a new chapter for scotland within the uk but also wider constitutional reform across the unionó. he said a vote against independence was ònot a vote against changeó. òwe must now deliver on time and in full the radical package of newly devolved powers to scotland,ó he added.yet that result raises the risk of further problems ð mps from cameronõs conservative party are threatening to vote against the prime ministerõs promise to quickly increase the scottish parliamentõs powers and protect its spending.the uk independence party leader, nigel farage, said cameronõs offer of more devolution for england did not go far enough. òthe english are 86% by population of this union. theyõve been left out of all of this for the last 18 years. we still have a situation where scottish mps can vote in the house of commons on english-only issues. i think what most english people want is a fair settlement,ó he said. cameron will try to calm tensions when he makes another statement on the result. the prime minister will explain how he will deliver further devolution to scotland, including giving greater powers over tax and welfare to the scottish parliament in edinburgh. the prime minister wants to move fast to show that the three main uk party leaders will meet the commitments they made during the referendum campaign.for the no campaign, there was relief: a number of opinion polls in the  nal days of the campaign had said the vote was on a knife-edge. this brought yes scotland within touching distance of victory after a dramatic surge in support.nannan
intermediate	brazil’s latest funk sensation, anitta, has won millions of fans by making the favela sound popular, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour.anti-discrimination campaigners and social commentators say the music industry’s fastest rising star has had to give up her blackness to be a success in the predominantly white middle-class market.the controversy began with the publication of then-and-now photographs that show a dramatic lightening of anitta’s skin tone since she signed a deal with warner.in the first photo, when she was quite unknown, she looked darker. in the second – a marketing photo after she became famous – she seems lighter. the contrast has restarted discussion about whether you need to have light skin to get ahead in brazil.jarid arraes, a psychology student and blogger, wrote a post criticizing the discrimination in media and marketing that she felt anitta’s image change represented. “people refuse to accept that they are racist and they think they live in a multiracial democracy, but the statistics show that is far from the case. white is the image of the rich, the nice, the successful, the good, while people see black as the opposite of all that.”born larissa de macedo machado, the diva-to-be was a church chorister in her childhood. in her teens, she made a name for herself in rio de janeiro’s baile funk scene as a dancer and singer.she now has an album and a huge hit single, show das poderosas, which topped the charts and attracted 52 million youtube views.many people love her because she is a pop idol with a strong message and some catchy tunes. her marketing team want people to see her as a cultural bridge between the predominantly black and mixed-race shanty towns on rio’s hillsides and the wealthier and whiter communities below.gangsta references and explicit lyrics of baile funk. now, however, questions are being asked about whether she – or her marketing team – have gone too far in changing her. arraes says that if pop stars have curly hair, they will want to straighten it. if they have a big nose, they will want to make it smaller. it creates a vicious cycle for how you feel about yourself.this is a sensitive topic in this largely mixed-raced nation. brazil – one of the last big countries in the world to ban slavery – has the largest population of african descent outside africa, but race and where your family come from are less important there than colour. there is a clear link between skin tone and inequality.in brazilian cities, white workers earn roughly twice as much as those of african descent. up until 2011, black or mixed-race students also spent two years less at school on average.most business and government executives are white, while most menial jobs are done by black and mixed-race workers. if you walk through ipanema, gávea or other rich districts, you are far more likely to see black nannies pushing strollers with white children than a white nanny pushing a black child.defining colour is complex. people who define themselves as white were in the minority for the first time in the most recent census in 2010. among the 197 million population, 82 million said they were “pardu” (mixed race), 15 million black, two million asian and 0.5% indigenous.sylvio ferreira, a psychology lecturer at the federal university of pernambuco, believes anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it more acceptable to everyone.maycon de mattos batista, a financial analyst who worked with anitta while she was an intern, said there had been a huge change in anitta’s image, but not of her colour.“i don’t believe it’s whitening; it’s more the way they are producing her with makeup, hairstylists and the way she dresses,” he said. “i don’t think that was because of pressure they put on her. she always liked to show off, sing and dance. that was a natural thing for her. i believe that it is because of this naturalness that she is where she is today.”nannannannan
intermediate	chemists have waited a long time for a new element to turn up and, now, four have been discovered by researchers in japan, russia and the us. the four new elements are the first to be added to the periodic table since 2011, when elements 114 and 116 were included. the new elements, all highly radioactive, complete seventh row of the periodic table and mean that science textbooks around the world are now out of date.the us-based international union of pure and applied chemistry (iupac), the global organization that controls chemical names, terminology and measurement, verified the elements on 30 december, 2015 after examining studies dating back to 2004. the scientists who found them must now come up with formal names to replace the latin-based temporary names – ununtrium, ununpentium, ununseptium and ununoctium – which reflect their atomic numbers, 113, 115, 117, and 118. the atomic number is the number of protons found in an element’s atomic nucleus.iupac announced that a russian-american team of scientists at the joint institute for nuclear research in dubna and lawrence livermore national laboratory in california had produced enough evidence to claim the discovery of elements 115, 117 and 118. the organization gave credit for the discovery of element 113, which had also been claimed by the russians and americans, to a team of scientists from the riken institute in japan. the decision means japan becomes the first asian country to name an element. under iupac rules, new elements can be named after mythological concepts, minerals, a place or country, or a scientist.when elements 114 and 116 were given formal names in 2012, scientists chose flerovium and livermorium respectively, after the flerov lab at dubna’s joint institute of research and the lawrence livermore lab in the us, where the elements were discovered. kosuke morita, who led the research at riken, said his team now planned to “look to the uncharted territory of element 119 and beyond”. jan reedijk of iupac, said: “the chemistry community is eager to see the table finally completed down to the seventh row.”the japanese team is considering three names for ununtrium: japonium, rikenium and nishinarium, after the nishina center for accelerator-based science, where the element was found. “they have been thinking about it for a while already,” said polly arnold, professor of chemistry at edinburgh university. “this is painstaking work. the work helps us with our models and with understanding radioactive decay. if we understand it better, hopefully we can improve how we deal with nuclear waste and things that are important in the real world. it also leads to fantastic technological advances in building the kit to make these observations.”along with new names, the scientists must suggest two-letter symbols for the elements. when iupac has received the researchers’ suggestions, they will go to public review for five months. that allows scientists and others to raise any objections. in 1996, the symbol cp was suggested for copernicium, or element 112, but it was changed to cn when scientists complained that cp referred to another substance.to discover the elements, researchers at the three labs slammed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for radioactive decays that should come from the new elements. ununtrium and ununpentium are thought to be metals. ununseptium could be a metalloid. the fourth element, ununoctium, may be a gas, like other elements, helium, neon and argon. it is hard to know for sure because so few atoms of each element have ever been made.paul karol, chair of the iupac panel that verified the elements, said: “it will be a long time before we can find practical uses for the new elements.”
intermediate	back in 2005, when blackberry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone, the company was just entering its boom times. while the iphone was still just an idea, blackberry’s innovations ensured its smartphone was one of canada’s biggest exports.six years later, in the summer of 2011, when there were riots in london and other uk cities, blackberry messenger (bbm) was so effective at mobilizing the rioters that politicians wanted the service to be temporarily shut down. but, two years later, it is the users themselves who are pulling the plug.demand for blackberry phones is falling. dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place, from facebook’s and apple’s instant messaging applications to independent apps such as whatsapp and kik (which is also canadian). they are free to download and use, and they use the internet to swap text messages, pictures, voice clips, ‘stickers’ and even videos between most types of phones.in an attempt to keep its customers, bbm has been released on android and apple phones. despite the competition from other apps, the response has been extraordinary, with more than 20 million downloads. but, despite this interest, many people believe bbm’s wider release will not save the service. “the move to bring blackberry to the iphone is four or five years too late,” says james gooderson, an 18-year-old student who blogs on technology. “whatsapp has made blackberrys unnecessary for young people.”bbm says it has 80 million monthly users after its upgrade, but whatsapp has 300 million. other services show bbm’s limitations: unlike skype and viber, it does not yet offer video or voice calls; unlike path, it does not do location sharing; there is no video sharing, as on imessage; and the stickers (a more sophisticated version of the smiley face), adored by kids all over the world, are also absent. even the contacts and calendar sharing that bbm made possible on blackberry phones are not on the apple and android versions.messaging is moving from verbal to visual. photos uploaded to instagram get instant comments and snapchat’s pictures, which selfdelete after ten seconds, have opened a world of other possibilities. like bbm, all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection. but as recently as 2011, bbm was so powerful it helped to start a revolution in egypt; and at the time of the london riots, it was a more immediate source of news than the television screen.“we could see on our blackberry messages where the rioters were going next; tv news would catch up four hours later,” said jean- pierre moore, 28. he manages a youth club in stockwell, south london, an area with some of the highest levels of crime and poverty in britain. moore mainly communicates on an ipad now. he does not agree with the idea that a shutdown of bbm would have stopped the looting. “the social networking wasn’t the reason,” he says.nearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application but two-thirds use more than one. among 16- to 24-year-olds, 60% use facebook every day, but 46% use alternatives. “it’s a much more complex, multifaceted environment,” says benedict evans, a digital media specialist. “all of these apps use your smartphone – they plug into your phone book and your photo library. apps rise and fall like fireworks. some, like instagram, last; others just disappear.”thirteen-year-old bennett has three phones. he keeps his blackberry for messaging, uses an iphone to play games, and makes phone calls on an android phone. his friends are still on bbm. at the touch of a few buttons, a single blackberry message can be sent to the phone owner’s entire contacts book – several hundred people, in some cases; on whatsapp, the limit for a broadcast message is 50. but, for bennett, instagram is now a major social network. “instagram is facebook without parents,” he says. “facebook has been taken over by the older generation. when i saw my mum on facebook, i deleted my account.”the low cost of buying and communicating on a blackberry is still an advantage. unlimited bbm messages are available to anyone with a secondhand was a belief that encrypted words sent over the company’s secure servers could not be traced back to their writers. arrests and prosecutions after the riots put an end to that belief. phone and a £7-a-month deal from a telecoms company. but people no longer trust the privacy of bbm. part of the attraction to business people, revolutionaries, demonstrators and riotersacross town from stockwell, outside the gates of a private school in the rich district of south kensington, the older pupils all have apple logos on their phones. they all use whatsapp. for many, bbm is a distant memory. “i still have a blackberry, but i’m the only one,” says a teenager standing with a circle of friends. and how does that make him feel? “isolated,” he replies.
intermediate	junior smart knows a lot about gangs. he is now 36 and his life can be divided into two phases. when he was a teenager, after his mother died, he joined a south london gang. at the time, it helped fill a big gap in his life.“they became my new support group,” he says. “at first it was just a bit of fun but then it became more serious, more and more about making money. they got involved in crime. that is how it was.” after leaving college, he got a full-time job in administration and worked as a dj. but, on the side, he was making money illegally as part of the gang.eventually he was arrested for serious drug crimes and was sent to prison for 12 years. “the first night after i was arrested was the biggest wake-up call of my life,” he says. “i had been living a double life. i had been living as one person to my peers and another person to my peers’ enemies. i spent a long time sorting myself out.”today, junior smart runs a team of 12 full-time workers and six volunteers, which aims to turn young criminals and gang members away from crime. most of the team are ex-criminals like smart. a few are still in prison but they are allowed out during the day to help. they work with the police, the probation service and other, voluntary organizations to help people who feel trapped and frightened in the violent criminal gangs of london.for smart, the extraordinary journey from gang member to mentor began when he was in prison. “i was touched by the people who kept coming back in,” he says. “i couldn’t believe that nothing was done about it. i was talking to the prisoners and they knew what changes they needed in their lives, but the problem is that the prison system only deals with the ‘index’ offence.”“one guy had a £300-a-week cocaine habit, which he paid for through burglary. he told me how he would walk into a house, even when he knew people were there. so although he had a drug addiction, that problem was never solved. the thing that shocked me is that it is simply a revolving door.”smart started working as a prison “listener” – a prisoner who helps new arrivals during their first days in prison. then he developed an idea to run his own scheme when he was out of prison – using the experience of ex-offenders to help others reject the revolving door of prison life. he was released early, after five years, and got the opportunity to put his idea into practice.so what does he think now? does he believe that things are getting better? he is careful to say positive things about the police; he says much of their work in arresting gang members has been good. but in general he is highly critical of a disjointed government approach that believes that, once the leader of a gang is arrested, the problem is solved. he agrees with a report that says the arrest of gang leaders can even make things worse. he says the effect of removing the leader is often to destabilize the entire gang.“when you arrest the top guy, everyone starts fighting for position. who was the most loyal? who had the most respect? it is a bit like a family. they are more likely to be violent. it means that the arrest of the gang leaders has been nullified because it has not had a long-term effect.”can it actually make the streets more dangerous? “it can. people take sides. if one gang knows that an elder [leader] has been arrested, then they suddenly think that gang’s weak ... and so there are gang disputes. and what happens when that elder is in prison? he forms alliances with other gang members, or when he is released he then tries to retake control. that is when violence happens.”in order to spread risk down to the lowest levels, he says gangs are now recruiting far more in primary schools. the youngest members are called “tinies”. “over the last years we have seen more and more of this. the tinies can be just eight to eleven years old.” the young protect their seniors from risk. they often do the street dealing or even the stabbing, he says.smart says that the challenges are immense, particularly with the current economic problems. “i try to help a young person who has been earning £300 a week through illegal methods. it was hard before, to try to convince him. but with unemployment high and cuts to benefits, it makes things more difficult.” however, his project, which has over 1,000 clients, is producing results. fewer than 20% of those who come in for help reoffend. smart believes that everyone deserves a second chance.nan
intermediate	the manchester united manager, sir alex ferguson, will retire at the end of the season after 27 years as the most successful manager in british football. he will become a director of the club and someone will have to replace a man who has won 13 english premier league titles, two champions leagues, the cup winners’ cup, five fa cups and four league cups.talking about his decision, ferguson said: “the decision to retire is one that i have thought a great deal about. it is the right time. it was important to me to leave an organization in the strongest possible condition and i believe i have done so. the quality of this squad, and the balance of ages within it, bodes well for continued success at the highest level. the structure of the youth set-up will ensure that the long-term future of the club remains a bright one.“our training facilities are amongst the best in world sport and our home, old trafford, is regarded as one of the leading venues in the world. i am delighted to take on the roles of both director and ambassador for the club. with these activities, along with my many other interests, i am looking forward to the future. i must pay tribute to my family; their love and support has been essential.“as for my players and staff, past and present, i would like to thank them all for a staggering level of professional conduct and dedication that has helped to deliver so many memorable triumphs. without their contribution, the history of this great club would not be as rich. in my early years, the support of the board of directors gave me the confidence and time to build a football club, not just a football team.“over the past ten years, the glazer family have made it possible for me to manage manchester united to the best of my ability and i have been extremely fortunate to have worked with a talented and trustworthy chief executive, david gill. i am truly grateful to all of them. to the fans, thank you. it has been an honour and an enormous privilege to have had the opportunity to lead your club and i have treasured my time as manager of manchester united.”the suddenness of ferguson’s departure is exactly how he said he would leave the job. he first mentioned the possibility of retiring during the 2001/2 season but then performed a u-turn. it is understood that he gathered the players in the first-team changing room shortly after they arrived for training. in an emotional speech, he announced he was retiring.joel glazer, joint owner of manchester united, said: “alex has proven time and time again what a fantastic manager he is but he’s also a wonderful person. his determination to succeed and dedication to the club have been truly remarkable. i will never forget the wonderful memories he has given us, like that magical night in moscow.”avie glazer, his brother, said: “i am delighted to announce that alex has agreed to stay with the club as a director. his contributions to manchester united over the last 27 years have been extraordinary and, like all united fans, i want him to be a part of its future.”david gill added: “i’ve had the tremendous pleasure of working very closely with alex for 16 unforgettable years – we have had countless wins and numerous signings. we knew that his retirement would come one day and we both have been planning for it by ensuring the quality of the team and club structures are in first-class condition. alex’s vision, energy and ability have built teams that are among the best and most loyal in world sport.“the way he cares for this club, his staff and for the football family in general is something that i admire. what he has done for this club and for the game in general will never be forgotten. it has been the greatest experience of my working life being with alex and a great honour to be able to call him a friend.”first-team coach rené meulensteen revealed how ferguson broke the news to his backroom staff. “i found out this morning when i came to the club,” he said. “he called us into his office and told us his decision. he’s obviously a man who thinks very, very hard so i’m sure he’s put a lot of thought into making this decision. i wish him well. he’s been fantastic for this club and i hope all the fans give the new manager the same support that he gets.”nan
intermediate	according to a group of experts, bogus allergy tests are convincing thousands of people to take unnecessary treatments and put themselves or their children on inadequate diets. this can result in malnutrition. allergies and food intolerances are increasing rapidly but confusion between the two, as well as misdiagnosis, are causing real harm, said the charity sense about science, which has produced a guide with the help of allergy specialists.“it’s probably the biggest mess for science communication – there are myths, misinterpreted studies and bad medical practice. all this results in under- and over-diagnosis,” said tracey brown, director of sense about science. “the costs are huge – unnecessary actions for some and not enough action for those whose lives depend on it.”experts fear that restaurants and caterers hear so many people say that they have allergies (which can be dangerous for the individual), when in fact they have a food intolerance (which is not dangerous), that they may not take all the precautions they should take when serving a person who has a genuine allergy.“it matters very much,” said moira austin of a charity that supports people suffering from anaphylaxis. “if a caterer thinks somebody is just avoiding a food because they don’t want to get bloated, they may be less careful. there have been a number of fatalities where people have gone to a restaurant, told staff that they have an allergy to a particular food and the meal has been served up containing that allergen.”the guide says most internet and shop-bought allergy tests have no scientific basis. they include a home-testing kit that looks for specific immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies against foods in the blood. these antibodies are part of the immune system’s response to infections but “the best medical evidence has shown that high igg levels do not suggest an allergy,” the guide says. “results are often positive in people who do not have an allergy or a food intolerance.”also unscientific is another test, a mixture of acupuncture and homeopathy. it attempts to measure electronic resistance across the skin while the child or adult holds the suspect food in their hand. hair sample testing is also pointless, the guide says. “hair is not involved in allergic reactions so testing hair samples cannot provide any useful information on allergies.”“i commonly see children who have been put on to unnecessarily restricted diets. their parents assume, in good faith, that they have allergies to multiple foods because of ‘allergy tests’ that have no scientific basis,” said paul seddon, a paediatric allergist. “this needs to stop, which can only happen if we prove these ‘tests’ are unscientific.”another paediatric allergist, adam fox said: “i get a number of patients who come in after sending their hair off for analysis or after excluding a whole range of foods for their children. it is very difficult to deal with that. there are two challenges. children need to be given proper diets but it is the unnecessary avoidance of things that aren’t harmful that has a huge impact on the quality of life. a child who can’t eat wheat or drink milk can’t go to parties.”the belief that a child’s chronic lack of energy or headaches or eczema are caused by an allergy takes a long time and many tests to prove or disprove. it is tempting to go to an alternative therapist who will do one test and provide a quick, but wrong, answer.allergies are increasing in developed countries. the percentages of children diagnosed with allergic rhinitis and eczema have both trebled in the last 30 years. this is leading many more people to suspect allergies are the reason for their own or their children’s health problems. the guide lists a number of myths about the sources of allergies, from the suggestion that they are caused by e numbers in food colourings to “toxic overload” and fast food.
intermediate	on one day in august, one in seven people on earth, 1 billion people, used facebook, according to founder mark zuckerberg. in ten years, the social network has completely changed peopleõs relationships, privacy, their businesses, news media, helped to end regimes and even changed the meanings of common words.òa more open and connected world is a better world. it brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society,ó wrote zuckerberg.these are just some of the ways his company changed everything ð for better or worse.1 facebook has changed the de nition of òfriendó òto friendó is now a verb. and, unlike in real life, it is easy to òunfriendó someone, a word invented to describe ending a facebook friendship when that person is no longer improving your facebook newsfeed.although the meanings of the words òshareó and òlikeó are basically the same, facebook has made the terms more important to us.school and university reunions are unnecessary ð you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and youõve seen pictures of your schoolmatesõ babies. you wonõt be surprised to see an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyõre dating someone else from the romantic sel es.but, unlike in real life, on facebook, all your friends have the same importance. a classmate from university who you havenõt seen for 15 years, a friend-of-a-friend from a party or a colleague youõve never actually spoken to in person ð they are all facebook friends in the same way as your closest friend or your spouse or your mum.it doesnõt necessarily mean we see them the same way. professor robin dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have about 150 people as a social group. facebook hasnõt changed that yet, he believes. but dunbar says he fears it is so easy simply to end friendships on facebook that, eventually, people may not need to learn to get on with each other.2 we care less about privacy the surprising thing is that facebook users happily hand over their information.pew research center found that most young people are more than willing to hand over their details. ninety- one per cent post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.but, because so much of a personõs life is shared online, facebook gives people a way to create an image and a fanbase. academics have described a new phenomenon: the òfacebook selfó.more than 80% of facebook users list their interests, which allows brands to target them effectively. but most younger users limit who can see their pro les, with 60% allowing friends only.3 facebook has created millions of jobs ð but not in its own of ces facebook provides indirect employment for people whose job it is to make facebook work for their brand.òit is a tool like no other,ó said michael tinmouth, a social media strategist who has worked with brands such as vodafone and microsoft. òmarketers have an understanding of a brandõs customers like they have never had before. the data available is extraordinary. you know who your customers are, who they are friends with and how they engage with your brand.óand advertisers pay a lot for that. facebook reported advertising revenue had increased by 46%, reaching $3.32bn.facebook is also a mine eld for brands. suddenly, customers donõt simply complain on the phone to a customer service representative or on a small specialist internet forum ð angry customers can post their complaints for hundreds of their friends to see or even on the brandõs own page.4 facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by facebook. manchester universityõs olga onuch found facebook had been the key way for reaching half of all the euromaidan protesters in ukraine. many of the people interviewed in onuchõs research said they relied on facebook for the truth about what was happening ð they donõt trust traditional media.5 facebook makes news, breaks news

intermediate	flappy bird be careful what you wish for, especially if you want to invent something new. recently, dong nguyen, the designer of the mobile game flappy bird, removed it from app stores. he said its success – it had been downloaded more than 50 million times and was making him around £30,000 from advertising each day – had ruined his simple life. on his twitter account, he said: “i cannot take this anymore.” ok, so regretting making flappy bird isn’t quite the same as regretting making a rifl e, but nguyen is just the latest inventor who wished he hadn’t created a monster.the labradoodle the labradoodle isn’t a monster – it’s adorable. but what’s monstrous is the way crossbreed dogs have been sold since the labradoodle’s inventor, wally conron, fi rst created the breed in the 1980s. “i’ve done a lot of damage,” he told the associated press. “i’ve created a lot of problems. there are a lot of unhealthy and abandoned dogs out there.” conron came up with the labradoodle when he was working for the royal guide dog association of australia to provide a dog for a blind woman whose husband was allergic to dog hair. what he didn’t expect was that the labradoodle – and other types of poodle-cross dogs, many of which have health problems – would become so popular.the ak-47 six months before his death in december 2013, mikhail kalashnikov, the designer of the assault rifl e, wrote to the head of the russian orthodox church: “my spiritual torment is unbearable. if my rifl e killed people, does that mean that i, mikhail kalashnikov, 93 years of age, the son of a poor farmer, christian and orthodox by faith, am responsible for people’s deaths, even if they were enemies?”electronic tagging the electronic tag was originally made in the 1960s as a way of tracking former prisoners’ attendance at school and work, and rewarding them for good behaviour. its inventors, bob gable and his brother kirkland, were later horrifi ed that the tag had become a form of control and punishment. “it’s not pleasant,” kirkland gable told the guardian in 2010, “but i’m not in control of the universe. i have to realize there are some things out of my control.”pepper spray after police sprayed peaceful protesters with pepper spray at a university of california campus in 2011, one of the scientists who helped develop it in the 80s denounced its use. “i have never seen such an inappropriate use of chemicals,” kamran loghman told the new york times.the offi ce cubicle in the late 60s, a new form of offi ce was designed to give workers privacy and increase productivity by providing more work space. instead, it became a way for companies to put employees into tighter spaces. these days, the cubicle is often connected with uniformity and soulless work. its inventor, bob propst, said, in 1997, “the use of cubicles in modern corporations is crazy.”
elementary	felix baumgartner stood at the edge of space above new mexico and paused for a moment. it was a small step away from the capsule, but a 24-mile drop back down to earth. “our guardian angel will take care of you,” said mission control, and baumgartner jumped.ten frightening minutes later, the austrian landed back on earth. he fell at speeds of up to 725 miles per hour, and he broke three world records. he became the world’s first supersonic skydiver when he broke the sound barrier. “we love you felix,” shouted his team in the control room.he was wearing a special suit to protect him against the very big pressure changes during the jump. without the suit, a man’s blood would boil and his lungs would explode. baumgartner later said that all he could think about was getting back alive, but he also said: “sometimes you have to go up really high to see how small you are.”his other two records were for the highest altitude manned balloon flight and the highest altitude skydive. the jump was on a sunny morning in good weather. baumgartner went up into clear skies in an enormous balloon – it was 30 million square cubic feet and its skin was one-tenth the thickness of a sandwich bag. at the bottom of the balloon was a capsule, where baumgartner sat in his suit.at the correct height, baumgartner went through a checklist of 40 things with his helper joe kittinger. kittinger held the record for the highest altitude manned balloon flight before baumgartner. baumgartner had a problem with his visor. “this is very serious, joe,” he told kitttinger. “i can’t see when i breathe out.” but they decided to continue, and a record 8 million people watched live on youtube.the ascent, during which the skies slowly turned black, took two and a half hours. but the descent was much quicker. three cameras, which were attached to baumgartner’s suit, recorded his free-fall of just over four minutes and then the parachute opening.baumgartner has done lots of dangerous things before. he has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave. he did two practice free-falls to prepare for this jump – one from 71,000 feet and a second from 97,000 feet. but nothing can compare with his jump above the town of roswell, a place famous for its ufo sightings.he was trying to break five different records: the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free-fall; the highest free-fall altitude jump; the highest manned balloon flight; the longest free-fall; and his jump platform is probably the largest manned balloon in history. the jump beat two of kittinger’s records: before, the retired us air force colonel held the high altitude and speed records for parachuting. kittinger jumped from a balloon 19 miles above the earth in 1960 and gave advice to baumgartner during the ascent.someone asked him, “what do you want to do next?” baumgartner said: “i want to inspire young people. i’d like to sit in the same place in the next four years as joe kittinger. if there is a young guy who wants to break my record, i want to give him advice.” he said the most exciting moment for him was when he was standing outside the capsule “on top of the world”. he added: “the most beautiful moment was when i was standing on the landing area and mike todd [the man who dressed baumgartner in his suit] came and he had a smile on his face like a little kid.”baumgartner said that he felt like todd’s son. he said: “todd was so happy that i was alive.” earlier, todd said: “the world needs a hero right now, and they have got one in felix baumgartner.” this will be the last jump, baumgartner said. he has promised to settle down with his girlfriend, and fly helicopters on rescue missions in the us and austria.nannannannan
elementary	not many exercise classes have a tea break in the middle. but margaret allen’s class has one. after a gentle warm-up and a few quick exercises, the 93-year-old great-grandmother lets her group sit down and relax with a cup of tea. some of the eight people in the class look like they need a break, but allen is not even sweating.the general rule is that eating just before doing sport is not a good idea and especially not halfway through the class. but, on the afternoon i visit allen’s class in saltburnby- the-sea, they eat fruitcake during the break. the cake was made for allen’s recent birthday by her 89-year-old sister, joan.the ladies have just finished their cake when allen gets up again. she plays a lively scottish song and there is lots of toe pointing and leg kicking. forty-five minutes later, the class is finally over.allen has been leading classes in the north-east town for 45 years. she wasn’t very sporty at school, but she started playing the piano for a keep-fit class during the second world war and started leading the class in her 40s when the old instructor retired.at one time, allen’s class had more than 18 regulars, each paying £1 a time. but, these days, the group is getting smaller. during the tea break, the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them went to that week for one of the younger people in the group who died recently, aged 68.allen is the oldest, her sister the second oldest. the baby of the group is 60-year-old jean cunion, who is a bit embarrassed to say that she is perhaps the least fit of the group. “i remember, the first time i came, margaret said, ‘who’s that breathing heavily?’ and i had to say it was me.” ruth steere, 76, says allen always has her back to the class, but she always knows what’s happening: “she always shouts at us if we go wrong. she’s very good at knowing what we are doing.”allen, who loves dancing, has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor. instead, she got ideas for her own moves from five fitness videos from the bbc. allen thinks she is healthy because she keeps busy, especially since her husband died in 1997. she started writing poetry when she was 80.“i write poems about everything. i just can’t stop,” she says, when she phones me a few days after the interview to read out a poem she has written about the joys of exercise. she still plays the piano and gives speeches. she also did a computer course when she was 88.ageing is no fun, she says. she reads me a few lines from a poem she has written called ‘that beast called age’. she happily remembers a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years ago, who said he didn’t believe she was more than 78: “i said, ‘thank you, doctor. you can go now.’”she also has a practical idea for people who are overweight: “i just think people shouldn’t eat too much. when i hear someone say, ‘oh, i can’t lose weight’, i say: ‘sellotape.’” she mimes taping her mouth shut. “i said this the other day to a big fat man. everything in moderation is my motto.”earlier in 2013, allen was watching the news and saw a woman get the british empire medal. “the woman said: ‘i’m 80 and i’m the oldest fitness instructor in the country!’ i thought: ‘no, you’re not.’” but allen won’t write to the queen to complain.nannan
elementary	when larry pizzi first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago, he asked: “why would anyone want to spoil a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it?”it’s a question that some people still ask. many bicycle shops in the us do not sell e-bikes.pizzi is ceo of currie technologies, the number one seller of e-bikes in the us. he believes that things will change very soon. other people who sell bikes agree. familiar brands including trek, raleigh and specialized all offer electric bikes and they believe that the market is going to grow.the us is different from other countries when it comes to electric bikes. nearly 32 million e-bikes were sold in 2014, most of them in china, where people mostly use them for transportation. they are popular in many parts of europe, too. they’re common in the netherlands and switzerland; german postal workers use them and bmw sells one for about $3,000.electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds, which use motors; you pedal an electric bike with – or without – help from an electric motor. riding an e-bike feels like riding a normal bike with a strong wind behind you; the motor just helps you go faster or climb hills. you can usually ride e-bicycles on bike lanes and they can’t travel faster than 20mph.e-bikes are banned in some states in the us, including new york. some bike shops don’t like putting motors on bicycles because it makes them too heavy. some e-bikes weigh nearly 30kg.e-bikes are also expensive. while cheap bikes sell for just $700, you will pay at least $1,500 for a quality e-bike with a good battery. the best bikes cost more than $3,000.but e-bike technology, particularly the batteries, is improving. “batteries are getting smaller, they’re getting lighter, they’re getting more reliable and they are lasting longer,” says don dicostanza, the ceo of pedego, an electric bikemaker and retailer.perhaps most importantly, more cities are building bike lanes so bicycle commuting has become more popular. electric bikes make commuting more practical – and fun – because people don’t have to worry about hills, strong winds, tiredness and sweat.most of our customers are “baby boomers who want to have the cycling experience they had as a kid,” says pedego’s don dicostanza. “the main reason they stopped riding bikes was because of hills.” pedego has opened nearly 60 stores in the us.electrobike has 30 stores in mexico. it opened its first american store in venice beach, california in 2014 and hopes to have 25 us stores in a year. ceo craig anderson says: “we want to help reduce traffic, help reduce our carbon footprint and encourage a healthy lifestyle.” he tells customers: “ride this bike once and try not to smile.”currie’s larry pizzi thinks that e-bikes will become popular in north america. “a lot of young people are using e-bikes for transportation, instead of cars.”there is even a cargo bike with a stronger motor and rack at the back. “you can carry two children,” says pizzi. “you can carry 45kg of shopping. it’s a minivan alternative.”nannannannan
elementary	the small room looks like a classroom. the posters on the walls show letters of the alphabet and a map of bangladesh.but, it is hard to concentrate – there is the loud hammering and chemicals in the air that hurt the throat and eyes. but, the children who learn in this three-square-metre room are lucky. they have escaped working in the factories opposite.for 14 years, sohay, a non-governmental organization (ngo), has worked in slums in dhaka to send child workers to school. it especially tries to help children who do dangerous work.the classroom is one of 23 centres that sohay has set up in dhaka. the classes at the centres help children enter primary school. when they are in school, the children get extra help with their homework at the centres.alamin, ten years old, used to work in a plastic factory. he now goes to one of the centres. his parents are happy that he’s now in school and not doing dangerous work. his friend rabi says he wants to forget his past in the factory. “i like school,” he says.sohay also has classes for parents and managers to stop child labour. it can be very difficult for working children to go to school. they are not like other children. after they stop working, they sometimes find it difficult to make friends and adapt to school. it is also difficult to make sure they stay in school – lots of these children don’t finish school.seven-year-old zhorna akter sumayya has two older brothers – they both work (one at a restaurant, one at a local club). but, she went to a sohay centre and she now goes to school. her family live in the slum and her parents need the money their sons make but they want their daughter to go to school.in 2015, sohay helped 1,540 children to leave dangerous work and helped 2,125 more children – those who would soon start work – to go to school. about 780 more children are preparing to start school in 2017.the labour law of bangladesh 2006 does not allow children younger than 14 to work but unicef says that, in bangladesh, 4.7 million children younger than 14 are employed and 1.3 million children aged five to 17 do dangerous work.nannannannannannan
elementary	when pope benedict xvi was elected in 2005, he said he was “a simple, humble worker in god’s vineyard”. and on a grey, cold, windy monday in february, he resigned in the same way: like an old workman with pains in his back and no more strength in his arms. the first german pope in modern times gave an exact departure time. “from 28 february 2013, at 20.00 hours”, he told a gathering of cardinals in the vatican, “the see of rome, the see of saint peter, will be vacant and there will be an election for a new pope.”one of the cardinals at the gathering was a mexican cardinal, monsignor oscar sanchéz barba, from guadalajara. he was in rome for an official meeting. “we were all in the apostolic palace,” he said. “the pope took a sheet of paper and read from it.“we were all …” – sanchéz barba couldn’t find the word. the cardinals had just heard the man they believe is god’s representative on earth resign. “the cardinals were just looking at one another,” sanchéz barba said.angelo sodano, the dean of the college of cardinals, who probably already knew about the pope’s decision, gave a short speech. he told the pope that the cardinals would be loyal to him and added that he and the others present had listened to the pope’s words with a feeling of confusion. at the end of his speech, the pope blessed the cardinals and left. “it was so simple; the simplest thing you can imagine,” said sanchéz barba. “then we all left in silence. there was absolute silence … and sadness.”john thavis spent 30 years reporting on the vatican and has a book, the vatican diaries, that will be published soon. he said he had a feeling before that the pope was going to resign. thavis said that in the long interview benedict gave to a german journalist in 2010, he had said he would resign if he felt he could no longer do the job. “i asked myself: if i were pope and wanted to resign, when would i choose? he has completed his series of books and most of his projects. also, there were no dates in his calendar of events he had to attend. i thought the most likely date was 22 february but i got it wrong.”soon after the announcement, the vatican was saying that the pope’s decision was brave. thavis agreed: “what i find particularly courageous is that he is going now, when he is not sick; and that he’s leaving because he’s tired and not because he’s ill.” but is that the whole story? does the pope know more about his state of health than the vatican has so far made public?benedict said that he is resigning not just for physical reasons but also for psychological reasons. he said that the position of pope needed both strength of mind and strength of body, and in the last few months he felt that he was slowly losing that strength. there will no doubt be other theories in future days and weeks, just as there were following the death of pope john paul i in 1978, 33 days after his election. already people are saying that there was a secret in benedict’s past and that somebody was going to tell everyone. the vatican will no doubt say those stories are nonsense. but we can understand why some people think there might be a secret, because benedict’s decision is so historic.at st peter’s basilica, julia rochester, from london, still didn’t know what the pope’s resignation meant. “if you’re god’s chosen person, how do you choose not be chosen?” she asked. it is a question many catholics will be asking their priests in future weeks.
elementary	the duke and duchess of cambridge have won the first part of their fight for privacy. a french magazine was told to stop selling or reusing photos of the royal couple. the pictures show the duchess sunbathing topless while on holiday in the south of france.it is possible that the magazine editor and the photographer or photographers will also have to go to a criminal court.the french magazine closer was told to give digital files of the pictures to the couple within 24 hours.closer’s publisher, mondadori magazines france, was also told to pay €2,000 in legal costs. the magazine will have to pay €10,000 for every day it does not give the couple the files.the court decided that every time mondadori – the publishing company owned by the ex italian prime minister silvio berlusconi – publishes a photograph in the future in france, they will get €10,000 fine.the couple welcome the judge’s decision. “they always believed the law was broken and that they had a right to their privacy.”the royal couple are pleased with the decision, but they want to have a much more public criminal trial against the magazine and photographer or photographers.under french law, if you do not respect someone’s privacy, you may have to spend a maximum of one year in prison and pay a fine of €45,000.this punishment would send a message to the world and, the couple hope, stop paparazzi taking photos like this in the future.on saturday the irish daily star also published the photos. and the italian celebrity magazine chi published a special edition of 26 pages with the photos of the future queen.nannannannannannannan
elementary	the last time she performed, we did not have mobile phones. now, 35 years later, as she performs again, singer kate bush sees a very different world.these days, most concerts are now lit up with phones and tablets, but bush does not want her fans to watch her shows through a screen.in august, before her concerts at the hammersmith apollo in london, bush asked her fans to put down their mobile phones at her gigs.bush wrote on her website: “i have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows. we have chosen a theatre, not a large venue or stadium. please do not take photos or videos during the shows.“i very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iphones, ipads or cameras.”bush is not the first singer or musician to say she doesn’t like phones at concerts. roger daltrey from the who recently said it was “weird” that people looked at their screen and not the artist on stage.he said: “i feel sorry for them, i really feel sorry for them. looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally – if you’re doing that, you’re 50% there, right? it’s weird.”in 2013, beyoncé told a fan, “you can’t even sing because you’re too busy filming. put that damn camera down!”recently, dutch football fans at psv eindhoven protested against the introduction of wi-fi in their stadium. they held up banners that said “no wi-fi. support the team,” and “you can sit at home.” manchester united have also told fans to leave their “large electronic devices” at home.singer jarvis cocker said, “it seems stupid to have something happening in front of you and look at it on a screen that’s smaller than a cigarette packet.”even in the world of classical music, one of the world’s top pianists surprised the audience in june 2013 when he left the stage because a fan was filming his performance on a smartphone. krystian zimerman returned moments later and said: “the destruction of music because of youtube is enormous.”but sam watt says that filming at concerts makes the experience even better. he works for vyclone, a phone app that puts together many videos uploaded by fans to create one long video of a show.“fans filming is now part of the concert experience – that is a just a fact. we take the videos that people are filming at concerts and mix them together with everybody else who was filming. the result is a really fantastic video,” he said.“we think that filming at concerts adds to the experience, and i think that, if kate bush came round for a cup of tea, we could have a really interesting discussion about this,” he added. “people are going to film and they want those memories – you’ve got to accept it.”nannannannannannan
elementary	a menu scandal at some of japan’s top hotels and department stores is damaging the international reputation of japanese food.one luxury hotel group admitted that it lied about ingredients on its menus. since then, there have been similar stories from restaurants run by famous hotels and department stores in japan.the story began when the hankyu-hanshin hotel group admitted that it gave false descriptions of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and october 2013.for example, the red salmon ‘caviar’ that customers ordered was in fact the eggs of the flying fish.the hotel group’s president, hiroshi desaki, went on television to announce a 20% pay cut for himself and 10% for other executives. but this did not make customers less angry.days later, desaki resigned – he said that the hotel group had betrayed their customers.so far, the company has refunded 20 million yen to more than 10,000 consumers. in total, they will refund 110 million yen.customers who believed they ate expensive kuruma shrimps were told they in fact ate much cheaper black tiger shrimps.complained in a blogpost that a ‘scallop’ dish he ordered at the prince hotel in tokyo contained a similar, but cheaper, type of shellfish.the hotel investigated the complaint and as a result corrected more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants. its report scared hankyu-hanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they, too, lied to customers who believed they were paying high prices for top ingredients.the hotel okura group – where barack obama has stayed – said they also injected beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly described tomatoes as organic.“we apologize for lying to our clients,” it said.the list of fraudulent ingredients gets bigger: orange juice from cartons that was sold as freshly squeezed; mont blanc desserts with korean chestnuts instead of the french ones on the menu; shop-bought chocolate cream that the menu said was home-made; imported beef sold as expensive wagyu beef.the menu scandal has come at the wrong time. japan is trying to persuade south korea and other countries to start to buy japanese food again after the fukushima nuclear accident.food industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 forced luxury hotels to save money.“menu descriptions were created to sound good to the customers, and, when hotels couldn’t get the ingredients on the menu, they just used food from different places,” hiroshi tomozawa, a hotel and restaurant consultant, told kyodo news.nannannannannannan
elementary	the international monetary fund (imf) has asked the usa to manage its money better. hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work after the government shut down for 16 days.us president barack obama said that the us has to be more careful with how it manages its money. the imf’s managing director, christine lagarde, asked for more stability.the senate wrote a peace deal, which included almost nothing that the conservatives asked for. the conservative republicans nearly caused a new financial crisis because they did not agree to obama’s healthcare reforms. the house of representatives agreed the deal at the last minute.the world bank was also pleased that the world’s economy had “avoided a catastrophe”. its president, jim yong kim, asked politicians in all countries to continue to make policies that improve the economy and give jobs and opportunity to all.the shutdown cost the us $24 billion.obama signed the legislation shortly after midnight on thursday. the bill passed easily, with support from all parties in the senate, where democratic and republican leaders wrote the agreement. it is a temporary solution. it gives the government money until 15 january and allows the government to borrow more money if they want to until 7 february.but the president made clear that he did not expect another serious budget fight and shutdown in 2014.at the white house, obama said he hoped the deal would “lift the cloud of uncertainty” that had hung over the country in recent weeks.“when this agreement arrives on my desk, i will sign it immediately,” he said. “hopefully, next time, it won’t be in the eleventh hour. we must manage our money better.”a journalist asked the president if the crisis would happen again in a few months. obama replied: “no.”earlier, the republican senator mike lee said there would be more trouble: “the media keeps asking: ‘was it worth it?’ my answer is, it is always worth it to do the right thing.” he added: “this is not over.”but the political deal on wednesday was one of the worst of all possible results for republicans. they did not achieve any of their goals and most people blamed them for the crisis.nannannan
elementary	james bond films are one of the world’s oldest and most successful film series. twenty-three bond films have been made so far. they have earned more than $6 billion at cinemas around the world. james bond is not slowing down. in fact, the films are more popular than ever – skyfall, which broke all records and became the biggest ever film at uk cinemas in 2012, earned a total of $1.1 billion.so, there was a lot of interest when they announced more details about the 24th bond film – especially its title, spectre. the number one question is: can spectre be as successful as skyfall?charles gant, film editor for heat magazine, thinks it can. “they were very clever when they made skyfall,” he says. “it was both modern and retro. daniel craig fans liked it and, also, older, more nostalgic bond fans, who lost interest over the previous few films. with the new title,” he adds, “it is certain to be a success.”eon productions is the company, started in 1961, that made dr no and all the “official” bond films. the company really wants the next film to be successful so it is using the same people that worked on skyfall in the new film. daniel craig will play bond and the same people have written the script. most importantly, sam mendes will again be the director. according to gant, mendes is the best bond director. gant says: “mendes attracted top actors like ralph fiennes. actors like fiennes will only be in a film if they like the director.”the bond series was not in trouble before the arrival of mendes – and craig – but the films were becoming a bit boring towards the end of pierce brosnan’s time as bond. there were no longer any more original bond stories to adapt and the films no longer had enough energy.this was nothing new: the history of the bond series has been one of constant change, especially of the lead actor: first, sean connery; then, george lazenby, roger moore, timothy dalton, brosnan and, now, craig. each new actor has been different and some have been better than others.lazenby only did one bond film. dalton’s two films, the living daylights and licence to kill, were during a period in the late 80s when more aggressive hollywood action movies were more popular. according to gant, “the period of roger moore’s last films and dalton’s films didn’t excite audiences. brosnan was more successful but craig is the best. on the other hand, the early bond films were sexy and exciting.”skyfall made more money than all the other bond films. but some of the 1960s bond films were almost as successful. with figures adjusted for inflation, the 1965 film thunderball is only a little bit below skyfall. and goldfinger and you only live twice both did better than the other craig films. licence to kill made the least money of all bond films and moore’s final film, a view to a kill, the second least.martin campbell is an experienced british director and he planned one of the most elaborate stunts in bond history. in the famous first scene of goldeneye (released in 1995), bond falls into a light aeroplane without a pilot. this scene helped to make the bond series more modern and popular. also, a very successful goldeneye video game created new, younger fans of bond and made people think that the bond film was no longer boring and old-fashioned.nannannannannan
advanced	an international agreement to improve safety in bangladesh’s clothing factories is facing the threat of legal action as factory owners demand compensation for the cost of closures and repair work. with some repair programmes expected to take months, factory owners say they cannot shoulder the costs of paying staff while factories are closed, alongside the expense of some major works needed to ensure buildings are safe. the building overhauls are being carried out in the wake of the collapse of the rana plaza complex in the capital of bangladesh, dhaka, in 2013, in which 1,138 people were killed.the problems come as hundreds of bangladeshi clothing factories per month are inspected for firesafety and structural problems under the accord on fire and building safety in bangladesh, which is backed by over 170 international brands, including primark and marks & spencer, and international trade unions, including industriall.the owner of one dhaka-based factory, softex cotton, has threatened legal action against the accord after his factory was closed down due to structural problems, prompting a demand for a reported $100m in compensation.another factory owner, who declined to be named, said that once a factory closed its doors, even for a few months, it would lose orders and close permanently: “there is no such thing as temporary closure,” he said. the factory owner said that the accord agreement had “pussyfooted” around the issue of who paid for factory closures amid efforts to get as many brands as possible to sign up to a deal in the wake of the rana plaza disaster. he said there was no clear process in place to handle the costs involved.jenny holdcroft, policy director for industriall, which has been closely involved in the accord, said that the agreement ensured that factories would not lose orders during closure because brands had committed to maintain orders with suppliers for two years.while 12 factories have been identified so far by the accord as needing significant work, holdcroft said many of those only needed partial closure in order to reduce stress on the building so production could continue on other floors. the accord also legally binds brands to ensure that workers are paid during factory closures. she said the detail on who would make payments had been left open in order to ensure that all those factory owners who could afford to pay for repairs and compensation for workers made the necessary contribution.“this was always going to be a topic of negotiation. brands don’t want to commit to paying so that rich factory owners who have just pocketed the profits and not been spending on their factories for years continue to do so. there was obviously going to be disruption. if there was no disruption, there would be no change,” she said. a spokesman for the accord said negotiations over payments and even legal action would not hold up its work to improve safety in factories.however, pressure on the accord to contribute to the payment of displaced workers has ratcheted up after a rival factory-safety group backed by us retailers including walmart and gap, the alliance for bangladesh worker safety, set aside $5m to help pay factory workers for up to two months while work is carried out on the buildings it has identified as needing improvement. it has, so far, identified five factories in four buildings where production needed to be suspended.“the alliance is sharing the workers’ salary along with entrepreneurs so now there is a big confusion. we had a big meeting with the accord to make them understand they have to come forward or how will we help our workers?” said shaidullah azim, a director of the bangladeshi garment manufacturers and exporters association.
advanced	tigers are more numerous in nepal than at any time since the 1970s, a new census has revealed, giving conservationists hope that the big cats, whose numbers have been dropping across south asia for 100 years, can be saved.the number of wild royal bengal tigers in nepal has increased to 198 – a 63.6% rise in five years – the government survey showed. “this is very encouraging,” said maheshwar dhakal, an ecologist with nepal’s department of national parks and wildlife conservation.the census is based on the examination of pictures from more than 500 cameras placed in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors. more than 250 conservationists and wildlife experts worked on the survey, which cost about £250,000. dhakal said that a parallel survey was conducted in india and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013. “it will take a few more months for india, which now has 1,300 big cats in several huge protected areas, to finalize the data,” he added. nepal has pledged to double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 when the last systematic tiger count took place.increasing prosperity in asia has pushed up prices for tiger skins and the body parts used in traditional chinese medicines. international gangs pay poor local nepali significant sums to kill the cats. the skin and bones are handed to middlemen, who pass easily through the porous border to india, where the major dealers are based.one major problem is complicity between senior officials and mafia networks involved in the trade. conservation experts credit the increase in numbers to the effective policing of national parks, stronger anti-poaching drives and better management of tiger habitats in nepal, where forests cover 29% of the land. but they say nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers prey so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat.as the number of tigers has increased over the years, so have incidents of conflict with villagers. seven people were killed in attacks by tigers around national parks in 2012 compared to four in 2011, park officials said. villagers are also seeking better protection. “the government is making conservation plans for tigers. but it should also come up with plans to protect people from tigers,” krishna bhurtel, a local village headman in chitwan, told nepali newspaper nagarik. wildlife authorities captured a tiger in chitwan after it killed two people, including a villager who was pulled from his bed in may.thousands of tigers once roamed the forests in bangladesh, india and nepal. but their numbers have dropped to about 3,000, a 95% drop over a century. chitwan national park in central nepal has the highest number of adult tigers, with 120, followed by bardiya national park (50) and shukla phanta wildlife reserve (17).diwakar chapagain, who heads a world wildlife fund nepal unit that monitors wildlife trade, said tiger skins were in demand in tibet, where well-heeled people use them as festival costumes.in nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins in front of stuffed tigers for special occasions. some affluent nepali have mounted tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms. tiger bones are in high demand for use in traditional chinese medicines. “the trade in tiger parts is lucrative and fetches thousands of dollars in illegal markets,” chapagain said, highlighting the threat tigers face.
advanced	they are the darkness seekers – and they are growing in number. on black fell, looking down on northumberland’s beautiful kielder water reservoir, a group of people wait in a car park next to a strange wooden building with a minimalist design beamed down from the future. this is kielder observatory, the centre of britain’s nascent astrotourism industry. and those waiting outside were the lucky ones. many more had applied for a night of stargazing at the observatory but numbers are strictly limited.inside, next to a woodburner and under dimmed lights, the observatory’s founder and lead astronomer, gary fildes, a former bricklayer with tarzan hair, delivers a pep talk to his colleagues and volunteers. the team discusses the prospect of seeing the northern lights but fildes is doubtful. instead, they decide to train their powerful telescopes on jupiter and venus and later to pick out stars such as capella and betelgeuse. an additional attraction is the appearance of the international space station.“remember,” fildes tells his team, “it’s about interaction, it’s about entertainment, it’s about inspiring people.” he puts on some music. pink floyd, the jam, the pogues. “by 9.30, the sky is going to be sexy,” fildes says. “it’s going to be epic.”fildes, 49, is at the forefront of the uk’s burgeoning astrotourism industry. the pivotal moment for northumberland came in 2013 when the entire national park housing hadrian’s wall, along with kielder water and forest park, some 1,500 sq km, was awarded dark sky park status, the only one in england. dark sky parks are rare. the 2013 star count revealed that only 5% of the uk population can see more than 31 stars on a good night.the tucson, arizona-based international dark-sky association (ida) confers the status only on places that take major steps to avoid light pollution. recipients must also prove their night skies are sufficiently dark. in northumberland dark sky park, as the area was rebadged, it is so dark that venus casts a shadow on the earth.duncan wise, visitor development officer for the northumberland national park authority, helped to spearhead the campaign for dark-sky status after the council for the protection of rural england found it was one of britain’s most tranquil places. “we tend to look at landscape as everything up to the horizon,” wise said. “but what about what’s above it?” wise and others spent years drawing up their submission to the ida, collecting reams of light readings and forming an alliance of local councils, parks’ bodies and community groups to produce an exterior lighting master plan that influences the construction of new developments in the area.their efforts have been vindicated. many of the 1.5 million who visit northumberland each year are now aware of its dark sky status. “we get a lot of people coming here to see the sky now,” says the man at the car-hire firm in newcastle. “they come in autumn and winter, when it’s darkest. good for the b&bs as they get business all year round now.” local hoteliers now issue guests with night-vision torches and put out deckchairs at night. those who have acquired some knowledge of astronomy can receive a badge confirming that their hotels are “dark sky friendly”.wise acknowledges that northumberland needs to do more to capitalize on its scarce resource and believes the region needs a couple more observatories to ensure that visitors will see what they came for. a £14m national landscape discovery centre, which he describes as the north’s answer to the eden project, will have an observatory when it is completed in a couple of years.fildes has grand designs. he is planning britain’s first “astrovillage”, one that would house the largest public observatory in the world and boast a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, a one-metre aperture telescope, and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes. the multimillion-pound project would feature a hotel and draw in 100,000 people a year, four times the number currently able to use the observatory. fildes is cryptic about his backers but believes the astrovillage will be a reality by 2018.however, northumberland faces competition. galloway forest park in scotland also has dark sky park status. since exmoor was designated europe’s first international dark sky reserve – one notch below dark sky park – in 2011, a range of local businesses offering stargazing breaks and safaris has sprung up. the uk will have to go some way to eclipse northern chile, which boasts more than a dozen tourist observatories and has some of the clearest skies in the world. the teide national park in tenerife is also becoming a major astrotourism destination.so, what is driving the desire to look upwards? the media have helped. tv presenters like brian cox have attracted a new generation of stargazers. “brian cox has made astronomy accessible,” says wise. “it’s no longer seen as the province of professors in studies with brass telescopes.” technology has also played a part. apps such as stellarium now turn smartphones into pocket-size planetariums. ultimately, though, fildes believes people are starting to appreciate what lies above. “if you had to build a visitor attraction from scratch, what could be better than the universe?”
advanced	we may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm back to the future ii, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched. experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally altering the transportation landscape. òitõs a very dynamic time,ó said robert puentes, of the brookings institutionõs metropolitan policy program think- tank. òthereõs a focus on a tighter connection between the role of transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people.óas the average us commute lengthens and the countryõs infrastructure ages badly, cities across the us are being forced to rede ne what transportation is. increasingly, urban planners, transportation experts and scientists are realizing that old auto-centric models focused on easing traf c congestion arenõt enough to tackle issues like population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now, more than ever, an integral component of a cityõs larger sustainability efforts.big us cities like los angeles, seattle and chicago are working to make better use of their streets by adding more bus lanes, augmenting pedestrian walkways and expanding their rail options, while at the same time working with the private sector on advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment, essentially making transportation intelligent. òthe most sustainable places to live are those places that have multi-modal transport systems,ó puentes said. òyou canõt be a global competitive city if you donõt have a robust transportation network.óhere are three of the key trends that experts predict will shape the transportation industry over the coming years. connectivity the rise of ride-sharing services like uber and lyft ð essentially taxis booked at the click of a smartphone button ð and apps like waze, which uses real-time traf c data to  nd the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people get around and affecting the very way in which traf c moves through a city. communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era, according to allan clelland, an expert on transportation technology.according to a recent study from the uclaõs institute of transportation studies, vehicle travel has declined among millennials ð individuals born roughly between the early 1980s and early 2000s ð compared to previous generations. according to the study, those born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives.meanwhile, those still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to waze. experts say the traf c app has eased congestion on motorways and reduced travel times for drivers but also led to a problematic rise in cars moving through residential neighbourhoods. this has angered residents, who claim the increased traf c on their quiet roads reduces their quality of life.this trend could continue as vehicle-to-vehicle data communication, as well as communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure, grows. currently, a traf c light can detect when a car is approaching but thatõs about it. companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.automation driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. however, the partial automation of cars is already underway. alexandre bayen of the university of california expects automation will progress in stages:  rst, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: essentially, vehicles that are connected electronically and travel in single  le.the idea of a fully automated transportation system is intriguing because it has the potential to improve safety by removing human error and increase the ef ciency of car owners, who can get on with other tasks during a long commute. it can also help reduce carbon emissions and traf c congestion and allow more people access to cars. but, even if driverless technology were ready to hit the roads now, it would take a long time to get fully automated given the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.to see what driverless cars might look like in action, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.environmental concern as the world races to avoid catastrophic climate change, and countries, states and cities work to meet ambitious emissions goals, these policies could also have a big impact on the future of transportation, spurring everything from zero- and low-emission vehicles to apps that encourage more walking, biking and carpooling.sharon feigon, executive director of the shared use mobility center, envisages a future where a person can use a transit pass that gives them access to numerous modes of transport in a given day. if their train is delayed, for instance, they can access a city bike, take a shuttle or rent a vehicle through a car share programme using the same pass. òweõre going to see these systems packaged together and make it as easy as possible to connect them up with each other so people can transfer seamlessly between them,ó she said.when considering the future of transportation, itõs also important to keep in mind why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. technologies and trends that reduce the need for those trips ð say, virtual meetings or telecommuting ð could also have a big impact on transportation.there was a time when the idea of a  ying car represented the height of innovation but the technologies being imagined and developed now could be seen as even more sophisticated ð and more useful in tackling the social and environmental threats that we face over the coming decades.ó
advanced	europe is to become the first place in the world to force ‘real-world’ emissions tests on car makers, opening up a new front in the fight to tackle air pollution. new regulations will introduce the tests to reveal what cars’ emissions are like when driving on roads and in traffic rather than in ideal, laboratory-like conditions, as is currently the case.green lit by european commission vice president, frans timmermans, the tests are designed to enforce a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre, a level met by only one car out of 16, according to researchers. other countries, such as china and korea, which are also considering real-world emissions tests, will be watching what happens next closely.pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and particulates are thought to be responsible for at least one quarter of the 29,000 annual pollution-related deaths in the uk alone. that figure is likely to rise, when the committee on the medical effects of air pollutants publishes what it calls “strengthening evidence” of damage to public health from nitrogen oxide emissions later in 2015.but the current ‘new european drive cycle’ laboratory test for measuring these emissions is a quarter of a century old and has been outpaced by technological developments in the car industry. studies have shown that the results of lab techniques to measure car emissions can easily be fixed by using techniques such as taping up doors and windows to minimize air resistance, driving on unrealistically smooth roads and testing at improbably high temperatures. campaigners say that car makers also use tricks such as programming vehicles to go into a low emissions mode when their front wheels are spinning and their back wheels are stationary, as happens in such lab experiments.“the commission is finalizing a proposal to introduce a new emissions testing procedure that will allow proper assessment of the vehicles in real driving,” said lucia caudet, a commission spokesperson. the proposal still needs approval from other commissioners and a technical committee but “we don’t expect any major internal hurdles,” a european union (eu) source added.“one key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 citizens annually is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars, causing many times more pollution on the road,” said greg archer, the clean vehicles manager for transport and environment. “the development of a new, real-world driving emission test is an important step forward in tackling urban air pollution. eu states should now support the commission’s proposals and ignore the whingeing from car makers that the rules are too tough.”according to research by the international council on clean transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg/km standard, with some models running at 22 times above the recommended limit. only one car out of 16 met the 80g target. around one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport – mostly diesel – and, in urban areas, concentrations can rise as high as 64%, european environment agency figures indicate.campaigners say that the car industry has tried to delay reforms to car test cycles but industry groups deny this, arguing that a five-year lead-time is necessary for technical and economic reasons. “real driving emissions (rde) is a totally new regulation that will force significant emission control hardware changes that may be demanded in the middle of a vehicle’s production lifetime,” said cara mclaughlin, a spokesperson for the european automobile manufacturers association (acea). “however, acea fully accepts that rde will apply to new types of cars from september 2017.”in an unusual move, the car association sent timmermans a draft regulation of their own for him to consider, after eu representatives finally agreed a regulation to implement the nitrogen oxide limits with beefed-up road trials and strict monitoring of exhaust fumes. acea’s draft regulation would have covered fewer pollutants and further delayed the regulation’s phased introduction until 2020. test distances would have been shortened from 1,300m to below 700m, minimum temperatures would have been raised from -7c to -3c and more rural roads would have been used. “the lobbyists were all over this,” archer said. “this was a real attempt at subversion of the legislative process.”after timmerman’s apparent rejection of the acea proposal, the regulation will now pass to commissioners for a rubber stamp, and member states for final amendments, before an expected introduction in september. by 2017, the first real-world car emissions tests are expected to begin in earnest. with a similar battle already looming over the testing of co2 emissions for cars at the end of 2015 – and with comparable debates in other countries – the introduction of the eu’s new emissions tests will be watched closely.
advanced	he is not the first person to express scepticism about mars one, a vastly ambitious private mission aiming to settle humans on mars from 2025. but joseph roche is different from most critics: he’s on the shortlist of astronauts.roche, an astrophysicist at trinity college dublin who was announced in february as among the 100 people in line for the mission, has written for the guardian expressing his grave doubts about the viability of mars one.the selection process, roche writes, “was not rigorous enough to reach the requisite standard of more traditional astronaut selection programmes”. he also says the dutch mars one team have displayed “a certain naivety” in believing they can succeed alone in the supposed $6bn mission and should now accept it is very unlikely to happen.he writes: “more openness and transparency would benefit mars one greatly but i think that the shortcomings of the selection process, coupled with their unwillingness to engage and collaborate with the scientific community mean that the time might have come for mars one to acknowledge the implausibility of this particular venture and turn their efforts towards supporting other exciting and more viable upcoming space missions.”roche also expressed worries about the way the mission organizers publicized a so-called top-ten candidates. the ranking, he said, didn’t mean these were the most likely potential astronauts but was, instead, based on how many “supporter points” each had earned through acts such as buying official merchandise.he writes: “these points are mars one’s supporter points which ‘represent the degree of your support to mars one’s mission’.” these points play no role in the selection process and serve only to show how much each supporter has donated to mars one.”the official timeline for the mission says the group plans to dispatch a stationary lander and satellite to mars in 2018, followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022. humans would start arriving in 2025 and crews of four would be sent every two years to add to the settlement. they would not return to earth.in february, a prominent supporter of the project, gerard ’t hooft, a dutch nobel laureate in physics, said he did not believe this timetable was realistic. he said: “it will take quite a bit longer and be quite a bit more expensive. when they first asked me to be involved, i told them: ‘you have to put a zero after everything’.”roche also spoke to medium, a us blogging platform that has previously expressed grave sceptism about mars one, reporting among other things that the supposed 200,000 applications to be astronauts in fact totalled 2,761.he told medium about the selection process in more detail: “i have not met anyone from mars one in person. initially, they’d said there were going to be regional interviews; we would travel there, we’d be interviewed, we’d be tested over several days and, in my mind, that sounded at least like something that approached a legitimate astronaut selection process.“but then they made us sign a non-disclosure agreement if we wanted to be interviewed and then, all of a sudden, it changed from being a proper regional interview over several days to being a ten-minute skype call.”roche told the guardian he did not want to give more interviews as he was wary about being negative about the idea of space travel.in his comment piece he writes: “i am passionate about pushing the boundaries of scientific endeavour and that is why the ambitiousness of the mars one plan appealed to me. although mars one were never likely to overcome the financial and technical barriers during their proposed timeline, it was refreshing to hear a new idea that challenges us to think about our own role in the future of space exploration.“being part of the subsequent public debate over the ethics and morality of future missions has been one of the most interesting and enjoyable aspects of my candidacy with mars one. if a one-way mission to mars ever became possible, then i would always volunteer. for an astrophysicist, that is not a difficult decision to make but it is also a moot point because i do not think we will see a one-way mission in my lifetime.”
advanced	the mass collection of telephone records by government surveillance programmes poses a clear threat to the personal privacy of ordinary citizens, according to us researchers who used basic phone logs to identify people and uncover confidential information about their lives.armed with anonymous “metadata” on people’s calls and texts, but not the content of the communications, two scientists at stanford university worked out individuals’ names, where they lived and the names of their partners. but that was not all.the same data led them to uncover potentially sensitive information about some individuals. one man was found to own a rifle, while another had recently been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. other data pointed to a new pregnancy and a person with multiple sclerosis.the results highlight the extraordinary power of telephone metadata – the number called, when and for how long – particularly when it is paired with public information available from services such as google, yelp and facebook. the value of the data, which is not subject to the same legal protections as the content of people’s communications, has long been recognized by the security services. as stewart baker, the former general counsel at the us national security agency (nsa), put it in the aftermath of edward snowden’s revelations: “metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody’s life.”patrick mutchler, a computer security researcher at stanford, said that while the power of metadata was understood by those gathering the information, the public was largely in the dark because so few published studies have revealed how rich the data is. “that makes it difficult for people with strong opinions about these programmes to fight them. now, we have hard evidence we can point to that didn’t exist in the past,” he said.for the study, the researchers signed up 823 people who agreed to have metadata collected from their phones through an android app. the app also received information from their facebook accounts, which the scientists used to check the accuracy of their results. in all, the researchers gathered metadata on more than 250,000 calls and over 1.2m texts.analysts who logged into the nsa’s metadata-gathering system were initially allowed to examine data up to three hops away from an individual. a call from the target individual’s phone to another number was one hop. from that phone to another was two hops. and so on. the records available to analysts stretched back for five years. the collection window has now been restricted to two hops and 18 months at most.writing in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences, mutchler describes how, on a shoestring budget, he and fellow graduate student, jonathan mayer, uncovered a wealth of personal information, some of it sensitive, about people who took part in the study. through automatic and manual searches, they identified 82% of people’s names. the same technique gave them the names of businesses the people had called. when these were plotted on a map, they revealed clusters of local businesses, which the scientists speculated surrounded the person’s home address. in this way, they named the city people lived in 57% of the time, and were nearly 90% accurate in placing people within 50 miles of their home. mutchler believes some of the misses came from people not updating their facebook page when they moved out of their parents’ home, for example, to go to college.the scientists next delved into more personal territory. using a simple computer program to analyse people’s call patterns, they inferred who among the study volunteers was in a relationship. once they knew the owner of a particular number had a partner, identifying the significant other was easy, they report.for the final part of the study, the researchers delved even deeper, to see what sensitive information they could glean from telephone metadata. they gathered details on calls made to and from a list of organizations, including hospitals, pharmacies, religious groups, legal services, firearms retailers and repair firms. from these, they pieced together some extraordinary vignettes from people’s lives.the metadata from one person in the study showed they had a long call from a cardiology centre, spoke briefly with a medical laboratory, answered a number of short calls from a local pharmacy and then made calls to a hotline for abnormal heart-rate monitoring devices. another participant made frequent calls to a local gun supplier that specialized in semiautomatic rifles and later placed a number of long calls to the customer support hotline run by a major gun manufacturer that produced the rifles. the metadata from two others suggested one had multiple sclerosis and the other had just become pregnant.“all of this should be taken as an indication of what is possible with two graduate students and limited resources,” said mutchler, who argues that the findings should make policymakers think twice before authorizing mass surveillance programmes. “large-scale metadata surveillance programmes, like the nsa’s, will necessarily expose highly confidential information about ordinary citizens,” the scientists write, adding: “to strike an appropriate balance between national security and civil liberties, future policymaking must be informed by input from relevant sciences.”ross anderson, professor of security engineering at cambridge university, said the study provided numbers that discussions can now be based on. “with the right analytics running over nationscale communications data, you can infer huge amounts of sensitive information on everyone. we always suspected that, of course, but here’s the data.”
advanced	margaret thatcher, the most dominant british prime minister since winston churchill in 1940 and a global champion of the late 20th-century free market economic revival, has died. the british government announced that she would receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours at st paul’s cathedral.the british prime minister, david cameron, who is cutting short his trip to europe to return to london following the news, said: “it was with great sadness that l learned of lady thatcher’s death. we’ve lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great briton.” he added: “as our first woman prime minister, margaret thatcher succeeded against all the odds, and the real thing about margaret thatcher is that she didn’t just lead our country, she saved our country, and i believe she will go down as the greatest british peacetime prime minister.”in a statement, president barack obama said, “here in america, many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with president reagan, reminding the world that we are not simply carried along by the currents of history – we can shape them with moral conviction, unyielding courage and iron will.”the first woman elected to lead a major western state, lady thatcher, as she became after the longest premiership since 1827, served 11 unbroken years at no 10 downing street.thatcher, who was 87, had been in declining health for some years, suffering from dementia. after a series of mini-strokes in 2002, thatcher withdrew from public life, no longer able to make the kind of waspish pronouncements that had been her forte in office – and beyond.her death was greeted with tributes from across the political spectrum.as labour sources announced the party would suspend campaigning in local elections as a mark of respect, its leader, ed miliband, said: “she will be remembered as a unique figure. she reshaped the politics of a whole generation. she was britain’s first woman prime minister. she moved the centre ground of british politics and was a huge figure on the world stage. the labour party disagreed with much of what she did and she will always remain a controversial figure. but we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength.”the deputy prime minister, nick clegg, said: “margaret thatcher was one of the defining figures in modern british politics. whatever side of the political debate you stand on, no one can deny that as prime minister she left a unique and lasting imprint on the country she served.”describing her as a political phenomenon, the former tory prime minister sir john major said: “her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.”the “iron lady” proved a significant cold war ally of the us president ronald reagan in the final showdown with the soviet union, which broke up under reformist pressures led by mikhail gorbachev, a kremlin leader with whom thatcher famously declared she could “do business”. as a result, many ordinary voters in ex-soviet bloc states saw her as a bold champion of their liberty, a view widely shared across the spectrum of mainstream us opinion – though not at home or among key eu partners.thatcher was an unremarkable mid-ranking conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975. within a decade, she had become known around the world – both admired and detested – for her pro-market domestic reforms and her implacable attitudes in foreign policy, including her long-running battle with the ira, which almost managed to murder her when it placed a bomb in the grand hotel, brighton, in 1984.at home, the emerging doctrine of thatcherism meant denationalization of state-owned industry – the new word “privatization” came into widespread use in many countries – and defeat of militant trade unionists, notably the national union of miners, whose year-long strike (1984– 85) was bitter and traumatic.boosted by the newly arrived revenues from britain’s north sea oil fields, thatcher had room to manoeuvre and change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies – including moderate members of her own party.but she also deployed her notorious “handbaggings”, or verbal attacks, in the european union to obtain a british rebate – “my money” as she called it. she was less successful in fending off the centralizing ambitions of the “belgian empire”, her description of the european commission, especially in the years when it was headed by the french socialist jacques delors.her allies in the tabloid press egged her on. and, as the british economy recovered from the severe recession that her monetarist medicine had inflicted on it – to tame the unions and cure inflation – she briefly seemed invincible.but untrammelled power, with the defeat or retirement of allies who had kept her in check, led to mistakes and growing unpopularity. when sir geoffrey howe, nominally her deputy, finally fell out with thatcher – chiefly over europe – his devastating resignation speech triggered a leadership challenge. thatcher made way for john major rather than risk losing to him in a ballot.in retirement, she wrote highly successful memoirs in two volumes and campaigned energetically on behalf of the thatcher foundation, which sought to promote her values around the world.
advanced	not just the identity of the man in the car park with the twisted spine, but the appalling last moments and humiliating treatment of the naked body of richard iii in the hours after his death have been revealed at an extraordinary press conference at leicester university.there were cheers when richard buckley, lead archaeologist on the hunt for the king’s body, finally announced that the university team was convinced “beyond reasonable doubt” that it had found the last plantagenet king, bent by scoliosis of the spine, and twisted further to fit into a hastily dug hole in grey friars church, which was slightly too small to hold his body.but, by then, it was clear the evidence was overwhelming, as the scientists who carried out the dna tests, those who created the computer-imaging technology to peer onto and into the bones in extraordinary detail, the genealogists who found a distant descendant with matching dna, and the academics who scoured contemporary texts for accounts of the king’s death and burial outlined their findings.“what a morning. what a story,” said philippa langley, of the richard iii society. she had been driving on the project for years, in the face of incredulity from many people, and finding funds from all over the world when it looked as if the money would run out before the excavation had even begun.work has started on designing a new tomb in leicester cathedral, only 100 yards from the excavation site, and a ceremony will be held to lay him into his new grave there, probably next year. leicester’s museums’ service is working on plans for a new visitor centre in an old school building overlooking the site.richard died at bosworth on 22 august 1485, the last english king to fall in battle, and the researchers revealed how for the first time. there was an audible intake of breath as a slide came up showing the base of his skull sliced off by one terrible blow, believed to be from a halberd, a fearsome medieval battle weapon with a razor-sharp iron axe blade weighing about two kilos, mounted on a wooden pole, which was swung at richard at very close range. the blade probably penetrated several centimetres into his brain and, said the human bones expert jo appleby, he would have been unconscious at once and dead almost as soon.the injury appears to confirm contemporary accounts that he died in close combat in the thick of the battle and unhorsed – as in the great despairing cry shakespeare gives him: “a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!” another sword slash, which also went through the bone and into the brain, would also have proved fatal. but many of the other injuries were after death, suggesting a gruesome ritual on the battlefield and as the king’s body was brought back to leicester, as he was stripped, mocked and mutilated.one terrible injury, a stab through the right buttock and into his pelvis, was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour. it suggests the story that his naked corpse was brought back slung over a horse, mocked and abused all the way, is true. bob savage, a medieval arms expert from the royal armouries who helped identify the wounds, said it was probably not a war weapon but the sort of sharp knife or dagger any workman might have carried.michael ibsen, the canadian-born furniture maker proved to be the descendant of richard’s sister, heard the confirmation on sunday and listened to the unfolding evidence in shocked silence. “my head is no clearer now than when i first heard the news,” he said. “many, many hundreds of people died on that field that day. he was a king, but just one of the dead. he lived in very violent times and these deaths would not have been pretty or quick.”it was mathew morris who first uncovered the body, in the first hour of the first day of the excavation. he did not believe he had found the king. the mechanical digger was still chewing the tarmac off the council car park, identified by years of research by local historians and the richard iii society as the probable site of the lost church of grey friars, whose priests bravely claimed the body of the king and buried him in a hastily dug grave, probably still naked, but in a position of honour near the high altar of their church. the leg bones just showing through the soil were covered up again.ten days later, on 5 september, when further excavation proved morris had hit the crucial spot, he returned with lin foxhall, head of the archaeology department, to excavate the body. “we did it the usual way, lifting the arms, legs and skull first, and proceeding gradually towards the torso – so it was only when we finally saw the twisted spine that i thought: ‘my word, i think we’ve got him.’”as far as langley is concerned, richard was the true king, the last king of the north, a worthy and brave leader who became a victim of some of the most brilliant propaganda in history, in the hands of the tudors’ imagemaker, shakespeare. there remains the dark shadow of the little princes in the tower, an infamous story even in richard’s day: the child edward v and his brother richard were declared illegitimate when richard iii claimed the throne, imprisoned in the tower of london and never seen alive again. although it is by no means certain that the bones found at the tower centuries later are theirs, there may be more dna detective work to be done there.
advanced	from all across rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring burundi, people  ock to the southern town of butare to a little shop called inzozi nziza (sweet dreams). they come for a taste of the unknown, something most have never tasted ð the sweet, cold, velvety embrace of ice cream.here, at the central african countryõs  rst ice- cream parlour, customers can buy scoops in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple  avours. toppings include fresh fruit, honey, chocolate chips and granola. black tea and coffee are also on sale.the shop, which has òice cream, coffee, dreamsó across its signage, is milking local curiosity about the dessert ð and òchanging livesó in the process, says inzozi nzizaõs manager, louise ingabire.òice cream is important,ó she says between mouthfuls of a honey- avoured offering. òsome rwandans like ice cream, but itõs a new thing. we still have some work to do, to tell others that theyõll enjoy it.ótrue to inzozi nzizaõs motto, the shop can certainly make dreams come true. òi didnõt have a job before: i just stayed at home. now, i have a vision for the future. i am making money and i can give some of it to my family,ó says the 27-year-old.butare, which has 89,600 residents and is located 135km south of the capital, kigali, is the home of the national university of rwanda. inzozi nziza has become a hub for tired students looking to treat themselves to something cool and different.òitõs something uniting people here,ó kalisa migendo, a 24-year-old agriculture student, says. òif you need to go out and talk to a friend, a girl or a boy, you come to inzozi nziza for an ice cream.ómost of the ingredients are sourced locally and the milk comes from a depot in nearby nyanza. the vanilla beans and cocoa are imported.inzozi nziza was opened by the theatre director odile gakire katese. she met alexis miesen and jennie dundas, co-founders of blue marble ice cream in brooklyn, new york, and formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010.òan ice-cream shop, katese proposed, might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits, hopes and family traditions,ó miesen says.at the start, miesen and dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative and non-pro t. they did not set  nancial targets, but waited for 18 months before they transferred their shares to the women, who had by then proved their business credentials.the shopõs success is no exception, says fatuma ndangiza, deputy chief executive of the rwanda governance board. òsmall businesses are mostly managed by women but when it comes to big business where you have to compete for big tenders, very few women are there. women are newcomers to big business,ó she points out. òwe have more women entrepreneurs. itõs an area where women are taking an interest, both in and outside kigali.óthough ice cream is somewhat new to rwanda, ndangiza is enthused by the idea of the shop. òi think itõs great. it requires a lot of skills and changing peopleõs mindsets because selling and eating ice cream is not part of our culture. i think being able to innovate and introduce this on the market, and the process of making it, is quite interesting.óthe butare shop employs nine women, who spend their spare time practising with ingoma nshya, rwandaõs  rst and only female drumming troupe, which was established by katese ten years ago.the musicians are hutu and tutsi women, some survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million tutsis and moderate hutus were killed.some members of ingoma nshya are widows, some orphans. others have been affected by the massacre in different ways.historically, says ingabire, rwandan women were forbidden to drum and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry. òbut itõs something which brings unity.óingabireõs father, two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide. òsome of us are survivors; some know someone who was killed,ó she says. òwhen iõm drumming with them, it gives me power because weõre still alive and survivors.óthe popular eatery features in a documentary by rob and lisa fruchtman, sibling  lm-makers. sweet dreams, which tells the story of how the women have forged a promising post-genocide future, also includes the female drummers.the  lm, which has been screened in more than a dozen countries, including the us, uk and several african states, premieres in rwanda in 2014. òwe feel the  lm is about resilience, hope, bravery, resourcefulness and the ability to change the course of your own life,ó says lisa fruchtman, who won an academy award for  lm- editing in 1984.
