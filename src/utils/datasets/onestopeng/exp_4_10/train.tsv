intermediate	male bosses are paid bonuses double the size of those given to female colleagues in identical jobs. this means that men get salary top-ups of £141,500 more than women over their working lives.the figures, released by the chartered management institute (cmi), reveal that men in uk management roles earned average bonuses of £6,442 in 2012 compared with £3,029 for women.in the most senior roles, female directors received bonuses of £36,270 over the past 12 months, compared with £63,700 awarded to male directors.the latest figures show that pay in british business is still not equal. this has led to calls for action from campaigners on workplace equality.ann francke, the cmi’s chief executive said: “it’s time to move this issue into the mainstream management agenda.“this is about changing our approach to management. there should be greater flexibility, less masculine cultures, more emphasis on outcomes rather than time in the office and greater transparency around performance and rewards.“in solving this issue, we would actually raise the performance of organizations and the well-being of individuals at work. what are we waiting for?”while some of the data may be affected by factors such as women doing jobs where there is less of a culture of bonus payments, the differences in the sizes of bonuses do appear to make britain’s pay gap worse. the government says the pay gap is closing but that full-time male employees still earn 10% more than women.maria miller, the minister for women and equalities, said: “the cmi figures are another example from the world of work showing that women still lose out to their male counterparts.“changes in the workplace are happening and it’s good that the pay gap is closing – but there is still more to do before we see full equality in the workplace.“the government is playing its part. we have signed up 120 companies to our think, act, report scheme, which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit, promote and pay women.“we’ve also looked at other pay gap causes, such as having to juggle work and family responsibilities. we have introduced shared parental leave and the right to request flexible working to all employees.”large companies such as tesco, bt, unilever and the international law firm eversheds are among those signed up to think, act, report. the scheme has only attracted 120 supporters in nearly two years of existence.however, the cmi’s data did provide some evidence to support miller’s statement that the overall pay gap is narrowing: the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses appeared to shrink from 2012.a sub-set of 17,000 individual managers, whose salaries and bonuses have been followed over a number of years, showed that male managers’ earnings are rising faster than women’s for the first time in five years. men’s earnings increased by 3.2% compared with a 2.8% increase for women, when salaries and bonuses are combined.at the most senior level, male directors’ earnings rose by 5.3% over the past 12 months, compared with just 1.1% for female directors.nannan
intermediate	vienna is the worldõs best city to live in, baghdad is the worst and london, paris and new york do not even enter the top 35, according to international research into quality of life.german-speaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th mercer quality of life study, with vienna joined by zurich, munich, dusseldorf and frankfurt in the top seven.paris has dropped down the table ð it has fallen ten places to 37th, just ahead of london at 39th, mostly because of the terrorist attacks on the city.the study examined social and economic conditions, health, education, housing and the environment. it is used by big companies to decide where they should open of ces and factories and how much they should pay staff.helena hartlauer, 32, from vienna, said she was not surprised at her cityõs top position. the cityõs social democratic government has a long tradition of investing money in high-quality social housing, which makes vienna less expensive than other major cities.òi live in a 100sq-metre apartment in a good area about 20 minutesõ walk from the city centre. but my rent is just û800 (£625) a month.ó a similar apartment in london would cost over £2,000 and even more in new york, ranked 44th in the table.us cities perform relatively badly in the study, mostly because of issues around personal safety and crime. the highest ranking city in the us is san francisco, at 28th; boston is 34th. canadian cities, led by vancouver, do much better than their us rivals in the table.òyou donõt realize how safe vienna is until you go abroad,ó said hartlauer. òwe also have terri c public transport, with the underground working 24 hours at weekends and it only costs û1 per trip.óvienna bene ted enormously from the fall of the berlin wall, becoming the gateway to eastern european countries that often have historic connections to the former austro-hungarian empire.òour big usp (unique selling point) is our geographical location,ó said martin eichtinger, austrian ambassador to london, who lived in vienna for 20 years. òthe fall of the berlin wall helped make vienna a hub for companies wanting to do business in central europe.óaccording to the world bank, austria has one of the highest  gures for gdp (gross domestic product) per person in the world, just behind the us and ahead of germany and britain, although below neighbouring switzerland.mercer says zurich in switzerland has the worldõs second highest quality of life but the viennese say their city is far more fun. òthere are more students in vienna than any other german-speaking city,ó said hartlauer. òitõs a very fast growing, young and lively city,ó she added.vienna has long been overlooked by british weekend city break tourists, who instead go to barcelona or berlin and tend to think of austria as somewhere for skiing, lakes and mountains.but, after an increase in budget  ights from british cities such as manchester and edinburgh, vienna is becoming a more popular destination. in 2015, there were 588,000 british visitors to vienna, 18% more than the year before.òvienna has ranked top in the last seven surveys,ó said mercer. òit scores highly in a number of categories; it provides a safe and stable environment to live in, a high standard of public transport and good recreational facilities.ólondon has never been in the quality-of-life top ten, says mercer, damaged by its poor scores for air pollution, traf c congestion and climate. after london, edinburgh is the next-ranking british city, in 46th place.paris has suffered the biggest fall in the most recent rankings. òparis has remained stable for several years but has, this year, dropped ten places,ó said mercer. òthe drop was mostly due to the terrorist attacks in 2015 because safety is a very important factor in the survey.óauckland in new zealand was the highest ranking english-speaking city in the survey, in third place, followed by vancouver in  fth. australian cities also do well in the survey, with sydney 10th and melbourne 15th.war and political unrest are behind all the worst- ranked cities in the world. surprisingly, damascus is named as only the seventh worst, ranked better than baghdad, bangui in central african republic, sanaõa in yemen, port-au-prince in haiti, khartoum in sudan and nõdjamena in chad.nannan
intermediate	wales will become the first country in the uk that will presume people have consented to donate their organs unless they opt out.the welsh assembly has voted to adopt the opt-out policy, which will allow hospitals to act on the assumption that people who die want to donate unless they have specifically registered an objection.the policy was passed by 43 votes to eight, with two abstentions, in spite of objections from religious groups for moral reasons and worries that the scheme could add to the unhappiness of grieving families.“this is a huge day for wales and, most importantly, for the 226 people in wales waiting for an organ transplant,” said the welsh health minister, mark drakeford.“i am proud that wales will be the first nation in the uk to take this step. as a society, we have shown we are prepared to take action to increase organ donation and to provide hope to those people waiting every week for a transplant.“family refusal is a major factor that affects the numbers of organ donations and the main reason for refusal is lack of knowledge of their loved one’s wishes.“the aim of the scheme has always been to respect the wishes of the deceased; however, relatives or friends may object to consent.“when family members know that organ donation is what the deceased wanted, they usually agree to the donation. the new law will work by making clearer people’s wishes around the issue of organ donation and it will increase the rate of consent to donation.”the issue is controversial – opponents are worried that the urgent need for more kidneys and hearts will lead to hospitals overruling the wishes of those who have died and their family. but the government insists their wishes will be protected.relatives will have a “clear right of objection”, giving them the chance to show that the deceased would not have wanted to be an organ donor.wales has acted because of an acute shortage of organs. “we have the problem of not having enough organs for people who need them,” said drakeford. “about one person every week dies in wales while on a waiting list.“around a third of the welsh population is on the organ donor register, but well over two-thirds in surveys say they are happy to be organ donors. that other third is people who don’t find the time to put their names on the register.”the new law would apply to anybody over 18 who has lived in wales for at least the year before his or her death. donated organs would not only go to people in need of a transplant in wales but to anybody in the uk.doctors are delighted at the new policy. the british medical association has campaigned for a long time for an opt-out system because it is worried about the growing number of people who need transplants.big efforts have been made in recent years to increase the number of those who carry an organ donation card, with a good deal of success. hospitals have also introduced improved systems for coordinating transplants, including the important discussions with relatives when no one really knows what the wishes of the deceased were. but the increase in numbers of organs that are donated is still not enough.some religious groups, on the other hand, strongly disagree with the new law – they argue that it would cause further unhappiness to relatives. members of the muslim council of wales and the south wales jewish representative council have expressed worries, while the archbishop of wales, barry morgan, said that “donation ought to be a gift of love, of generosity. if organs can be taken unless someone has explicitly registered an objection, that’s not an expression of love. it’s more a medical use of a body.”nannan
intermediate	nelson mandela, the towering figure of africa’s struggle for freedom and a hero to millions around the world, has died at the age of 95.south africa’s first black president died with his family beside him at home in johannesburg after years of illness, which had caused him to stop taking part in public life.the news was announced to the country by the current president, jacob zuma. he said mandela had “departed” around 8.50pm local time and was at peace.“this is the moment of our deepest sorrow,” zuma said. “our nation has lost its greatest son. what made nelson mandela great was exactly what made him human. we saw in him what we look for in ourselves.“fellow south africans, nelson mandela brought us together and it is together that we will bid him farewell.”zuma announced that mandela would receive a state funeral and ordered that flags fly at half-mast.barack obama led tributes from world leaders, referring to mandela by his clan name – madiba. the us president said: “through his fierce dignity and strong will to sacrifice his own freedom for the freedom of others, madiba transformed south africa – and moved all of us.”uk prime minister david cameron said: “a great light has gone out in the world” and described mandela as “a hero of our time”.fw de klerk – the south african president who freed mandela and shared the nobel peace prize with him in 1993 – said the news was deeply sad for south africa and the world.“he lived reconciliation. he was a great unifier,” de klerk said.people gathered in the streets of south africa to celebrate mandela’s life.in soweto, people gathered to sing and dance near the house where he once lived. they sang songs from the anti-apartheid struggle. some people were wrapped in south african flags and the green, yellow and black colours of mandela’s party, the african national congress (anc)mandela’s death sends south africa deep into mourning and self-reflection, nearly 20 years after he led the country from racial apartheid to democracy for all.but his passing will also be felt by people around the world who considered mandela to be one of history’s last great statesmen, comparable with gandhi and martin luther king.it was his act of forgiveness, after spending 27 years in prison, 18 of them on robben island, that will assure his place in history. with south africa facing possible civil war, mandela chose reconciliation with the white minority to build a new democracy.he led the anc to victory in the country’s first multiracial election in 1994. he then voluntarily stepped down after one term.born rolihlahla dalibhunga in a small village in the eastern cape on 18 july, 1918, mandela was given his english name, nelson, by a teacher at his school.he joined the anc in 1943 and became a co-founder of its youth league. in 1952, he started south africa’s first black law firm with his partner, oliver tambo.mandela was a charming, charismatic figure with a passion for boxing and an eye for women. he once said: “i can’t help it if the ladies notice me. i am not going to protest.”when the anc was banned in 1960, mandela went underground. after the sharpeville massacre, in which 69 black protesters were shot dead by police, he took the difficult decision to begin an armed struggle. he was arrested and eventually charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government.conducting his own defence in the rivonia trial in 1964, he said: “i have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society, in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.“it is an ideal which i hope to live for and to achieve. but, if necessary, it is an ideal for which i am prepared to die.”he was not given the death penalty but was sentenced to life in prison.finally, in 1990, fw de klerk lifted the ban on the anc and mandela was released from prison, to scenes of great happiness that were seen around the world.archbishop desmond tutu, said: “ he restored others’ faith in africa and africans.”mandela’s 91st birthday was marked by the first annual “mandela day” in his honour. married three times, he had six children, 17 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.nannannannan
intermediate	robert mys_ajek stops. between two paw prints on a muddy mountain track, the scientist  nds what he is looking for. òdroppings!õõ he says happily. it is so rare to see a wolf that seeing faeces makes it a good day.but it is getting easier. there are now about 1,500 wolves in poland. the number has doubled in 15 years. wolves are ð along with the brown bear, the lynx and the wolverine ð europeõs last large predator carnivores. conservationists from britain, germany and the netherlands are coming here to  nd out how the country has saved wolves who are criticized even in fairy tales.bits of bone and hair stick out from the black faeces. òit ate a red deer,õõ says mys_ajek, the university of warsaw biologist. òin my lab, i can tell you all about this wolf ð not only its diet but its gender, sexual habits, age, state of health and family connections.õõdna tests have shown that polish wolves are travellers. òone wolf reached the netherlands, where unfortunately it was hit by a car. they have a very big range. they need space. the average territory required by a polish pack is 250 square kilometres,õõ says mys_ajek.òcan we ever reintroduce wolves to scotland?õõ asks student alex entwisle, 23, on a study trip to southern poland from the uk. he and other animal science students have spent the day looking for droppings and paw prints in the beskidy mountains of the polish carpathians.their hot discussion topic is whether to reintroduce wolves to the british isles for the  rst time since the 18th century.mys_ajek toured the scottish highlands in 2015 for the wolves and humans foundation and answered questions from villagers about the polish experience. òthe big difference between scotland and poland is that we eat pork. we do not have many sheep here.òthe similarity is that we have a lot of animals ð 300,000 red deer and more than 800,000 roe deer. in poland, we also have too many wild boar ð about 200,000 ð and these are eating and destroying farmersõ cereal crops. here, wolves are part of the solution,õõ he says.the scientist says wolves can move up to 30 kilometres during a single hunt. òthe beskidy pack is a strong unit, eight or nine animals. this year, we have recorded  ve cubs, two young wolves and two adults.òwe track them using motion cameras in the forest and by following their prints in the mud and snow. in each family group, only one pair of adults has cubs each year. all pack members care for the young.õõmys_ajek, the son of a shepherd, doesnõt understand wolvesõ bad reputation. òwhy did we have to have the fairy tale little red riding hood, with its big bad wolf?õhe is fascinated by these aloof animals who remained in the wild 33,000 years ago when others decided on a much more comfortable life as domestic dogs.mys_ajek says only scienti c arguments ð the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population ð can save europeõs wild carnivores, especially the unpopular wolf. ònatural predators balance the ecosystem. they reduce the number of herbivores, which allows trees to grow tall for birds to nest in.õõthe ban on wolf hunting in the western carpathians became law in 1995 and in the whole of poland in 1998. there are now wolf packs in nearly all the countryõs major forests where the wolves coexist with humans.the polish government pays compensation for farm animals killed by wolves. mys_ajek advises farmers to put up electric fences. he has helped bring back the use of two deterrents that, for reasons no one understands, wolves  nd very scary: strings of small red  ags (that you hang around sheep pens) and the tatra mountain sheepdog.polandõs wolves have been helped by the countryõs late infrastructure development. in 1989, when the communists left power, poland had only one motorway. major road projects began after poland joined the european union in 2004 and they are required to consider wild animals.attitudes have also changed. òfor many years, hunting was cultural. in 1975, there were fewer than 100 wolves in poland. from the 1950s, hunting wolves was encouraged by the authorities. they paid a reward for killing a wolf worth a monthõs salary. it was carnage.õõmys_ajek says that polish wolves are much safer now but they are not completely safe. packs of wolves cross country borders and hunting still happens in neighbouring russia, lithuania, belarus, ukraine and slovakia.he says polandõs new government, elected in october 2015, doesnõt like wolves. òthe environment minister, jan szyszko, is a hunter. there are 120,000 licensed hunters in poland and they have a lot of in uence.òbeing a wolf advocate is not easy. you canõt argue to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction. most tourists want to see the animals but wolves stay away from humans. they have a very sensitive sense of smell.õõthe 12 british animal science students leave the polish carpathians without seeing a wolf. entwisle does not believe that scotland will ever be able to match polandõs success.òit would be amazing for the environment to have wolves back in scotland because of the problem of too many deer. but it would just not be possible because of the roads and sheep.òthere would be problems with farmers, too. in britain, we like predators to be far away and to watch them on television,õõ said entwisle.nannan
intermediate	a new report has warned that up to a billion people will remain in extreme poverty by 2030 unless countries confront the social, economic and cultural forces that keep them in poverty. the report by the chronic poverty advisory network says that many people may rise above the poverty line of $1.25 a day, but slip back again when they experience problems such as drought or illness and insecurity or con ict.the report found that, in parts of rural kenya and in south africa, 30 to 40% of people who escaped from poverty fell back again, rising to 60% in some areas of ethiopia between 1999 and 2009. even in successful countries such as indonesia and vietnam, the proportion was 20%.individual examples show how easy it is for people to slip back into poverty. amin, from rural bangladesh, has seen his livelihood gradually decline, due to his own and his wifeõs illnesses, the cost of his sonõs marriage, the death of his father and loss of goods such as  shing nets. lovemore, from zimbabwe, has become one of the poorest people in his village. he recently lost his job due to bad health and had to take in his  ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters.òwe need to ensure that people who are lifted out of poverty remain above the poverty line permanently. too many families are slipping back into poverty because they struggle to recover from personal or bigger setbacks. governments shouldnõt assume that, just because somebodyõs income reaches $1.25, that means job done,ó said andrew shepherd, lead author of the report.a un high-level panel said it was possible to achieve the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030. the report, however, argues that òmore of the sameó will not get to zero. despite a drop in extreme poverty from 1.9bn in 1990 to 1.2bn in 2010, the report says that progress in the next 15 years will be much harder. the big gains in china are unlikely to be matched by similar progress elsewhere, while climate-related shocks and deep poverty in parts of sub-saharan africa will slow down progress.the report says the focus should be on the chronically poor ð those who are poor for many years or their entire lives ð and on stopping the descent into poverty. ògovernments have been quite good at moving people over the poverty line because that is relatively easy. but they have shied away from the more dif cult job of trying to solve chronic poverty,ó said shepherd.the report says progress on poverty reduction has had less of an impact on the chronically poor than on those who were already closer to the poverty line. it will not be possible to get to zero unless development policies focus on the chronically poor, it adds. the report suggests three policies, all of which require massive global investment.the  rst is social assistance ð to bring the poorest people closer to a decent standard of living. the second is education, from early childhood to the start of work, to enable people to escape and stay out of poverty. the third is economic growth policies that ensure that the bene ts of increasing national prosperity reach the very poorest people.all this will cost money and the report says one obvious implication is that countries will need greater tax revenues. aid will also be needed for the start-up costs for social assistance, universal health coverage and to  nance education, including scholarships for the poorest children. òthere remains a huge role for aid in the next 20 years, as many developing countries spend less than $500 on each of their citizens a year. even nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per person,ó shepherd said.with the current crises in syria, south sudan and the central african republic, the report says it is essential that governments try to reduce the risk of con ict and to create peace.the report also argues that, if the inequalities which affect the poorest people ð such as access to land, labour markets and the power relationships between men and women ð are addressed, this would tackle two goals at the same time: reducing chronic poverty and inequality.the authors urge governments to develop an inclusive national development plan and to work with civil society to ensure that the poorest people are represented politically as well as trying to stop dif cult social norms, such as dowries and witchcraft, that contribute to extreme poverty: òthis often means challenging parts of the status quo.ónannan
intermediate	thousands of people protested on australiaõs beaches against a shark cull that is being carried out in western australia. they called on the stateõs prime minister to end the policy, and rspca australia and virgin atlantic owner richard branson spoke out against it. the catching and killing of sharks longer than three metres began after what the state government called an òunprecedentedó number of shark attacks on western australiaõs coast. a 35-year-old surfer, killed in november 2013, was the sixth person to die from a shark attack in two years.however, the whole of australia has had an average of just one shark-related death a year for the last 50 years. kate faehrmann, of the sea shepherd conservation society, said from a protest in the state capital, perth: òweõve always said that this policy wonõt work. drumlines used to catch the sharks kill sharks whether theyõre one, two, three metres or more, as well as dolphins, turtles and other things. thatõs why the community doesnõt want it.óthousands of people protested on beaches in the cities of perth, sydney and adelaide, and at beaches in victoria and queensland. faehrmann said the protests had shown that australians wanted sharks protected: òwhatõs amazing is so many people in australia love sharks. this has demonstrated something about the national psyche; that, despite all the fear, thousands of people are coming out across the country to say, ôthatõs their ocean. we respect them, we love them and we donõt want them killed.õó anthony joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharkõs mouth, said: òthe number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference.óthe state government has refused to say how many sharks have been killed, though there have been reports of sharks smaller than three metres being released after getting caught on drumlines,  oating drums  xed to the sea bed with bait hanging on hooks underneath them. conservationists say there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, because no previous cull has only used drumlines. researchers at the university of western australia say the increased number of shark attacks in the state is probably because the state has the fastest-growing population in australia, not because of a rising number of sharks.richard peirce, of the uk-based conservation charity, the shark trust, said that the cull would be ineffective and could bring more predators towards the coast. òthe activity in western australia is compounding the human tragedy of shark attacks. it is very sad that a government has ignored the best advice and chosen an approach that is ineffective and counterproductive,ó he said. òpeople often donõt consider that that drumlines are indiscriminate ð even if monitored through the day, leaving the lines in at night has the potential to attract other predators into the area, attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured.óworldwide, in 2012, there were 80 attacks by sharks, seven of which were fatal, compared to nearly 100m sharks killed by humans each year. rspca australia said in a statement that it believes the cull is unjusti ed. òthere is no evidence that the increase in attacks is a result of increasing shark numbers. instead, it is consistent with a changing population and human behaviour; that is, there are greater numbers of people in the water,ó it said.richard branson said the policy was not working. òiõm sure one of the reasons western australia premier, colin barnett, did it was because he was thinking it would encourage tourism. itõs going to do quite the reverse, i think. youõre advertising a problem that doesnõt exist in a major way and youõre deterring people from coming to perth and your beautiful countryside around it. all youõre going to achieve, i think, is to worry people unnecessarily.ó

intermediate	margaret thatcher, the best known british prime minister since winston churchill in 1940 and a global supporter of free market economics, has died. the british government announced that she would receive a ceremonial funeral at st paul’s cathedral.the british prime minister, david cameron, said: “it was with great sadness that l learned of lady thatcher’s death. we’ve lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great briton.” he added: “as our first woman prime minister, margaret thatcher succeeded against all the odds, and she didn’t just lead our country, she saved our country.” he added that he believed she would be remembered as the greatest british peacetime prime minister.in a statement, president barack obama said, “here in america, many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with president reagan, reminding the world that we can shape the currents of history with our moral beliefs, courage and iron will.”the first woman elected to lead a major western state, margaret thatcher served 11 years at no 10 downing street before members of her own party removed her in 1990.thatcher, who was 87, had been in poor health for some years, suffering from dementia. when they heard of her death, politicians from all parties sent tributes.labour party leader, ed miliband, said: “she will be remembered as a unique figure. she reshaped the politics of a whole generation. she was britain’s first woman prime minister. she moved the centre ground of british politics and was a huge figure on the world stage. the labour party disagreed with a lot of what she did and she will always be a controversial figure. but we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength.”the deputy prime minister, nick clegg, said: “margaret thatcher was one of the most important figures in modern british politics. whatever party you support, no one can deny that as prime minister she left a unique and lasting imprint on the country she served.”describing her as a political phenomenon, the former conservative prime minister sir john major said: “her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.”the “iron lady” was a cold war ally of the us president ronald reagan in the final showdown with the soviet union, which broke up as a result of reformist pressures led by mikhail gorbachev, a kremlin leader with whom thatcher famously said she could “do business”. as a result, many ordinary voters in ex-soviet bloc states saw her as someone who supported their liberty.thatcher was an unremarkable conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975. within ten years, she had become known around the world – both admired and hated – for her pro-market reforms in the uk and her implacable attitudes in foreign policy, including her long battle with the ira, which almost succeeded in murdering her with a bomb in 1984.at home, thatcher was associated with denationalization of state-owned industry – the new word “privatization” became used in many countries – and defeat of militant trade unions, particularly the national union of miners, whose one-year strike (1984–85) was traumatic. with money from britain’s north sea oil fields, thatcher was able to change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies – including moderate members of her own party.in the european union she got a rebate for britain – “my money” as she called it. she was less successful in controlling the european commission, who wanted to centralize power in europe, especially in the years when it was led by the french socialist jacques delors.as the british economy recovered from the very bad recession that her policies had caused, she seemed invincible for a short time. but unlimited power and the defeat or retirement of allies led to mistakes and increasing unpopularity. when her deputy finally fell out with her – mainly on the subject of europe – his damaging resignation speech led to a leadership challenge. after a vote among conservative mps failed to support her, john major took control of the party.after she retired, she wrote highly successful memoirs and campaigned energetically for the thatcher foundation, which aimed to promote her values around the world.nannannan
intermediate	nobody knows which came first: the economic crisis in greece or shisha, the drug now known as the “cocaine of the poor”. but what everyone knows is that shisha is a killer. and it costs only €2 or less a hit.“it is the worst kind of drug. it burns your insides, it makes you aggressive and makes you go totally mad,” said maria, a former heroin addict. “but it is cheap and it is easy to get, and it is what everyone is taking.”this drug crisis has put athens’s health authorities, already having to deal with large financial cuts, under further strain.the drug of preference for thousands of homeless greeks forced on to the streets by poverty and despair, shisha is described by both addicts and officials as a drug that is related to crystal meth. the synthetic drug is frequently mixed with battery acid, engine oil and even shampoo. it has the potential to send users into a state of mindless violence. and, even worse, it is not only easily available, but also easy to make.“it is a killer, but it also makes you want to kill,” konstantinos, a drug addict said. “you can kill without understanding that you have done it. and it is spreading faster than death. a lot of users have died.”for charalampos poulopoulos, the head of kethea, greece’s anti-drug centre, shisha symbolizes the crisis that has led to record levels of destitution and unemployment. it is, he said, an “austerity drug” – it is the response of dealers who have become more and more clever at producing synthetic drugs designed for those who can no longer afford more expensive highs from such drugs as heroin and cocaine.“the crisis has given dealers the possibility to promote a new, cheap drug, a cocaine for the poor,” said poulopoulos at a centre for addicts in exarcheia, in athens. “shisha can be sniffed or injected and it can be made in home laboratories – you don’t need any specialized knowledge. it is extremely dangerous.”across greece, six years of recession have been brutal and cruel. depression, together with drug and alcohol abuse, has risen dramatically. crime has soared as a result of austerity measures that have cut the income of ordinary greeks by 40%. prostitution – the easiest way of paying for drugs – has similarly skyrocketed.“many women agree to have unprotected sex because that way they’ll make more money,” said eleni marini, a psychologist with kethea. “shisha has been linked to a very intense sexual drive but it attacks your ability to think clearly and we’re seeing a lot more pregnancies among drug addicts who engage in prostitution.” in 2012, two sex workers gave birth on the streets of athens.as the number of suicides has also increased and hiv infections are spreading, drug addicts (a population believed to be around 25,000) have become increasingly self-destructive. and, experts say, young greeks marginalized by record rates of unemployment – at 64% greece has the highest youth unemployment in the eu – are leading the way.“the crisis has created a widespread sense of pessimism,” said poulopoulos. “for those who might have stopped taking drugs, there is now no incentive. instead, there’s an atmosphere of misery, where people who know they won’t find work are becoming a lot more self-destructive. in athens, where the economic crisis has hit hardest, shisha is part of that.”just when the need for help has never been greater, state-funded organizations such as kethea have had their money cut by a third at the request of the european commission, european central bank and international monetary fund. these organizations are trying to stop the greek economy from sinking.since the financial crisis began in 2009, kethea has lost 70 of its 500 staff. the cuts come despite studies that show that, for every euro they spend on anti-drug programmes such as kethea, the greek state saves about €6 in costs to the criminal justice and healthcare systems. “the cuts we have witnessed are a false economy, a huge mistake,” said poulopoulos.on the streets of athens, where shisha is growing in popularity, there is a fear that austerity not only doesn’t work – it kills.nannannan
elementary	the researchers were surprised by what people would do to avoid the task. what was the task? to sit in a chair and do nothing but think.some people found it so unbearable that they gave themselves mild electric shocks to stop the boredom.two-thirds of men pressed a button that gave them a painful shock during a 15-minute period of solitude. a quarter of women also pressed the shock button.the report from psychologists at virginia and harvard universities looks at the question of why most of us  nd it so hard to do nothing.in more than 11 separate studies, the researchers showed that all kinds of people hated being left alone to think ð it doesnõt matter what their age, education or income is, or how often they use smartphones or social media.researcher timothy wilson said that the results were probably not because of the speed of modern life or because of mobile phones and social media. instead, he said those things might be popular because we feel we need to do something and hate doing nothing. during the  rst experiments, students were taken into a room and told to think. they were alone, without their phones, books or anything to write with. the only rules were that they had to stay sitting and not fall asleep. they were told that they would have six to 15 minutes alone.the students were questioned at the end of the experiment. most of them did not enjoy the experience. they found it dif cult to concentrate and their minds wandered.the researchers did the experiment again with people at home. they got similar results. surprisingly, people found it even more dif cult and they cheated by getting up from their chair or checking their phones.the researchers did the study again with more than 100 people, aged 18 to 77, from a church and a farmersõ market. they also disliked just sitting and thinking.but, there was an even more surprising result. to check if people might prefer something bad to nothing at all, the students had the possibility of giving themselves a mild electric shock.before the experiment, all the students said they would pay to avoid mild electric shocks.but 12 of 18 men gave themselves electric shocks and six of 24 women gave themselves electric shocks.the scientists were surprised. they said that being alone with their thoughts was so hard for many participants that they gave themselves an electric shock, something the participants had said they would pay not to get.jessica andrews-hanna at the university of colorado said many students would probably give themselves an electric shock to make a boring lecture more exciting. but, she says we need to know more about wilsonõs study.òimagine ð a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will give them a harmless but uncomfortable shock, and they are told to just sit there with their thoughts,ó she said.òas they sit there, their mind starts to wander and naturally they think about that shock ð was it really that bad?ónannannannan
elementary	the world shares him and london claims him but stratford-upon-avon is going to spend 2016 celebrating william shakespeare as their man. he was born in the warwickshire market town in 1564 and died there 400 years ago.stratford was important to shakespeare all his life, says paul edmondson, the head of learning and research at the shakespeare birthplace trust. òpeople often think shakespeare left stratford and his family, went to london to earn his fortune and only came back to die,ó he said. òbut stratford is where he bought land and houses, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought. we are going to spend the year re-emphasizing the importance of shakespeare, the man of stratford.óthe anniversary of the death of the man from stratford, the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world, will be celebrated across britain and the world. there will be performances of macbeth in singapore and romeo and juliet in brussels. shakespeareõs globe is completing the  rst world tour in the history of theatre. during the tour, it has taken hamlet to every country except north korea. in london, they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema, one screen to show each of shakespeareõs plays.the national theatre, the royal shakespeare company and almost every other theatre production company in the country will celebrate the anniversary. there will be traditional and experimental performances of the plays. there will also be hundreds of lectures, international conferences,  lms, concerts, operas and major exhibitions.shakespeare was famous in his own lifetime but there is little documentary evidence about shakespeareõs life and times. his plays survived because his friends and actors collected together every bit of every play they could  nd and made the first folio, published in 1623, seven years after shakespeareõs death.the actor mark rylance has called the first folio his favourite book in the world and most of the surviving first folios will be on display ð including those that belong to the british and bodleian libraries, and a copy recently discovered in france. some of the most precious documents will be shown in an exhibition in london.the exhibition, by me, william shakespeare, will include his will, documents from the time when shakespeare and other actors dismantled a theatre on the north side of the thames and rebuilt it as the globe on the south bank, and details of payments for performances for james i and queen anne.the director of the globe theatre recently said as a joke that shakespeare was a true london man. but people in stratford believe that the town made and educated shakespeare. they are rebuilding his old school room and will open it as a visitor attraction.shakespeare bought new place, the second best house in the town, where he died in 1616 on 23 april, the same day as his birth. òyou donõt buy a house like new place and not live there,ó paul edmondson said. òthe general public and many academics have underestimated the importance of stratford to shakespeare.óedmondson believes that, after shakespeare bought the house in 1597, all his thinking time was spent there. he says the late plays were planned in his library and probably written there.shakespeareõs house was demolished 300 years ago. another house was built in the same place. that house was destroyed in 1759 by a bad- tempered priest, francis gastrell, in an argument about taxes. he also cut down shakespeareõs mulberry tree, under which the writer sat and worked, because he didnõt like all the tourists looking into his garden.the house has never been rebuilt but they have found shakespeareõs kitchen in the cellars. the area where the house was will be on display for the anniversary, with the foundations marked and the garden restored. òwithout stratford,ó edmondson said, òthere would have been no shakespeare.ónan
elementary	the average six-year-old child understands more about digital technology than a 45-year-old adult, a new report says.the arrival of broadband in the year 2000 has created a generation of digital natives, ofcom (which checks standards in the uk communications industries) says in its report. these children, who were born in the new millennium, are learning how to use smartphones and tablets before they can talk.jane rumble from ofcom said that, because they are growing up in the digital age, childrenõs communication habits are different from older generations, even from the 16-to-24 age group.800 children and 2,000 adults took ofcomõs òdigital quotientó, or dq, test. the test  nds out how much people know about tablets, smart watches, superfast internet, 4g mobile-phone networks and mobile apps. it also tries to  nd out how happy they feel about using them.in 6- to 7-year-olds, who have grown up with youtube, spotify music streaming and online television, the average dq score was 98. adults aged between 45 and 49 scored an average of 96. digital understanding is highest between 14 and 15 years old ð this age group have an average dq of 113.people can now test their digital knowledge with a short version of the questionnaire. it will give anyone a dq score. the website also gives people advice on how to improve their understanding and protect themselves and their families online.the ways in which children contact each other are very different from older generations.the biggest change is in time spent talking on the phone. twenty years ago, teenagers spent their evenings on the home telephone line, talking about love and friendships in conversations that lasted for hours.but, now, for children aged 12 to 15, phone calls make up just 3% of time spent communicating through any device. for all adults, this rises to 20% and, for young adults, it is 9%. todayõs children communicate most by sending written messages or through sharing photographs and videos.over 90% of the time they spend using devices is spent sending messages: chatting on social networks like facebook, sending instant messages through services like whatsapp or even sending traditional mobile-phone text messages. just 2% of childrenõs time using devices is spent emailing. adults spent 33% of their time using devices emailing.when they are not using their phones, 12- to 15-year-olds have a very different relationship with other media, too. a digital seven-day diary shows that only half of their viewing time is spent watching live television, compared to nearly 70% for all adults. they spend 20% of their time watching short video clips, for example on youtube, or news clips on facebook and other social sites. the rest of their viewing time is spent watching dvds, streamed content through net ix or itunes and recorded television programmes.nannannannan
elementary	when we talk about climate change, we usually just talk about the problem. we usually forget the many solutions. these solutions make recycling faster, reduce emissions and create alternatives to plastic, air conditioning, smartphones and fast fashion that are better for the environment.the intergovernmental panel on climate change met in copenhagen to present its latest report. there is now climate change on all continents. we must increase our efforts to reduce emissions to make sure that climate change does not get out of control. copenhagen looked at the risks and challenges but it also looked at the solutions.the sustainia award looked at ten best solutions to climate change. the solutions are used in 84 countries. from the areas of food, fashion, energy, transport, education and health, the awards showed that the future may not be so bad.from california, we saw how we can now produce plastics from greenhouse gases. these plastics are good quality and not too expensive. from switzerland, we learned a better way to recycle and reuse old clothes and shoes. and from canada, we learned how smartphones can make bike-sharing easier.the ten projects each offered unique solutions to the problem of climate change. the nigerian project, wecyclers, won the sustainia award 2014.wecyclers makes it possible for poor communities to make money from the waste from their streets. families in lagos collect the rubbish on the streets. then, bicycles come and collect the waste. families get points for the garbage they collect. they can use these points to get things they need.recycling companies buy wecyclersõ waste. they make the waste into products such as mattresses, pillows and trash bags. wecyclers helps to solve local waste problems in lagos, where only 40% of the cityõs rubbish is collected.only 46% of town and city waste in africa is collected. more than 5,000 families are involved in the wecyclers scheme and there are plans to start the project in other cities in nigeria.solutions to climate change are often hi-tech. but, to solve all the different problems, we need different solutions. we canõt just reduce emissions ð we must also use our natural resources more intelligently and create healthier lives for ourselves.
elementary	it is no longer legal to smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the worldõs drinking capital, new orleans, louisiana. since hurricane katrina in 2005, new orleans city government has begun trying to reduce noise problems. the city is now stricter on noise in bars and nightclubs ð and, at the same time, it has introduced new rules on noise.òit is the wrong time for this,ó complains bar-owner william walker. he hates the anti-smoking law. òif they force people outside the bar to smoke, it is going to increase the tension thatõs already there.ómany of new orleansõs best bars are in quiet neighbourhoods. martha wood lives beside a loud bar that has live music. òthe bar was one reason i bought the house so i wonõt ever complain about the noise,ó says wood. she also manages a live-music bar.the maple leaf club became smoke-free in 2014. another club also became smoke-free because performers asked for smoke-free nights. òa lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers. i wish the city had just let that happen, not force the ban into every bar that doesnõt have music,ó says zalia beville, manager of the all ways lounge.luckily, all ways has an outdoor patio. another bar, lost love lounge, doesnõt have a patio. the owner, geoff douville, loves the ban ð before, he felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar popular. òi couldnõt ban smoking in my bar without a ban in the whole city,ó says douville. òpeople think i have that choice. but, if i make a no-smoking rule, they will choose another bar with smoking.ómany small business owners also fear that the smoke-free rule will make them lose money. neil timms owns an english pub and saw a smoking ban before, in england. òback home in england, every pub i knew closed because of the smoking ban,ó remembers timms of englandõs ban, which began in 2007. to avoid the same problems, heõs spending money to build a patio.but douville feels the ban could be a great business opportunity. òthere are lots of people who would enjoy coming to our bar but they never came because they didnõt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days ð now, those people can come.ó douville isnõt worried about noise complaints: òno court is going to say a bar is a ônuisanceõ after the city has introduced a smoking ban that forces you to go outside!ó he says.councilwoman latoya cantrell, who introduced the ban, disagrees: òthe responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their customers respectful outside as well,ó she says. òthe owners need to tell them to go and have a smoke but be respectful to their communities. the idea that we canõt have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous. we can have clean air without noise problems ð i think itõs about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.ómany people were worried that the police would not have time to give bars warnings and  nes. so the health department will do it. bar customers must ò ll out a form or call 311 and include photographs of illegal smokingó.geoff douville says that heõs used to noise complaints. òyou will see: the neighbours who complain about the noise now are going to be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban. of course theyõre going to complain,ó he adds. òbut it doesnõt mean theyõre going to win.ónannannan
elementary	the vice-president of google has warned that digitized material from blogs, tweets, pictures, videos and official documents such as emails could be lost forever because the programs we need to view them will no longer exist. our first steps into the digital world could be lost to future historians, vint cerf told the american association for the advancement of science’s annual meeting. he said that we might become a “forgotten generation or even a forgotten century” because of “bit rot”, where old computer files become useless junk.cerf said we should develop digital methods to preserve old software and hardware to read old files. “so much of the information about our daily lives is in digital form, like our interactions by email, people’s tweets and all of the world wide web. so it’s clear that we could lose a lot of our history,” he said. “if we want to keep it, we need to make sure that people can still see the digital objects we create today in the future,” he added.what is ‘bit rot’ and is vint cerf right to be worried? his warning highlights an irony about modern technology: we digitize music, photos, letters and other documents so that they survive for centuries but the programs and hardware people will need to read those files don’t survive.“we are throwing all of our data into an information black hole. we digitize things because we think we will preserve them. but what we don’t understand is that, if we don’t do something, those digital versions may not be any better than the things that we digitized. in fact, they may be worse,” cerf says. “if there are photos you really care about, print them out.”ancient civilizations did not have these problems because people wrote histories down and we need only eyes to read them. to study today’s culture, future historians will have to read pdfs, word documents and hundreds of other file types, using special software and sometimes hardware, too.the problem is already here. in the 1980s, it was normal to save documents on floppy disks and buy computer games on cassettes. even if the disks and cassettes are in good condition, we can now only find the equipment to view them in museums.cerf warns that we will also lose important political and historical documents because of bit rot. in 2005, american historian doris kearns goodwin wrote a book about abraham lincoln. she went to libraries around the us and found the paper letters of the people involved. “in today’s world, those letters would be emails and it will be almost impossible to find them one hundred years from now,” said cerf.he admits that historians will try to preserve important material. but he says that people often don’t understand the importance of documents until hundreds of years later. historians have learned how archimedes thought about infinity in 3bc because they found his writings hidden under the words of a thirteenth-century book. “we’ve been surprised by what we’ve learned from objects that have been preserved by accident,” he said.researchers in pittsburgh are trying to find a solution to bit rot. they are creating a computer that can read old files.inventing new technology helps but it is only part of the solution. it could be even more difficult to get the legal permissions to copy and store software before it dies. “to do this properly, we might need to think about things like copyright. we’re talking about preserving documents for hundreds to thousands of years,” said cerf.
elementary	bb king was most famous for blues music but he was always interested in other types of music and different cultures. perhaps it is too early to say he is òthe last of the bluesmenó but it is hard to imagine that any future blues artist will have the in uence as bb king. he in uenced thousands of musicians and millions of music fans in a career that lasted 65 years.riley b king was born in mississippi, the son of african-american farm workers. he learnt the guitar from a family friend and learnt to sing with a quartet of gospel singers. in his early 20s, he moved to memphis.he was soon playing regularly at a bar in west memphis and he also became a disc jockey, with a show on a local radio station. he was known as òthe beale street blues boyó but this was shortened to òblues boy kingó and then to òbbó. in 1950, king began recording for modern records.he had his  rst hit in 1952 with three oõclock blues. it was number one in the r&b chart for 15 weeks; it was the  rst of many hits. king developed a style that was new and different but had its roots in blues history. he often praised the musicians who in uenced him and he usually mentioned t-bone walker  rst. he also mentioned the earlier blues guitarists blind lemon jefferson and lonnie johnson and the jazz players charlie christian and django reinhardt.he once explained that his guitar technique was partly the result of his lack of skill: òi started to bend notes because i could never play in the bottleneck style. i loved that sound but just couldnõt do it.ó during the 1950s, king was the leading blues artist in many series of concerts. in 1956, he played 342 concerts. in 1962, he tried to change that working pattern by signing with a major label, abc. but the  rst records under that contract were not very successful with his fans or with the record company. but his 1965 album, live at the regal, has become famous and in uenced many younger musicians. he had more r&b hits with blues songs and, in 1969, he was near the top of the pop charts ð where no blues artist had been for many years ð with a song called the thrill is gone.it was a long time before he became known to a rock audience but musicians who admired him brought him to the attention of rock fans. òabout a year and a half ago,ó he said in 1969, òkids suddenly started saying to me, ôyouõre the greatest blues guitarist in the world.õ and iõd say, ôwho told you that?õ and theyõd say, ômike bloom eldõ or ôeric claptonõ. these young musicians made me popular again.ófrom then on, king was well known as a leading blues artist. he went on international concert tours to japan, australia, china and russia. he also gave concerts to prisoners in chicago and at san quentin. in 1990, doctors told king he had diabetes and he reduced his touring. he now had to play sitting down but his singing and playing were almost as good as ever. the celebrations for his 80th birthday, in 2005, included an award-winning album with clapton, mark knop er, roger daltrey, gloria estefan and others, tributes from bono, amadou bagayoko and elton john, and a ògoodbye touró that was not a goodbye at all.in 2009, king received a grammy award, for best traditional blues album, for one kind favor. in 2012, he performed at a concert at the white house, where the us president, barack obama, joined him to sing sweet home chicago. king was twice married and twice divorced. he is survived by 11 children by various partners; four others died before him.nannan
elementary	a report by the world health organization (who) says that 35.6% of all women around the world will experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, usually from a male partner. the report says that 30% of women are attacked by their partners. it also says that a large percentage of murders of women – 38% – are done by their partners.the highest levels of violence against women are in africa, where nearly half of all women – 45.6% – will experience physical or sexual violence. in poor and middle-income europe, the percentage is 27.2%. but, richer countries are not always safer for women – a third of women in rich countries (32.7%) will experience violence. 42% of the women who experience violence have injuries, which doctors and nurses may notice. the report says that injuries are often the first opportunity to discover violence in the home and to offer the woman help. violence has a big effect on women’s health. some come to hospital with broken bones and others have problems related to pregnancy and mental illness.the who has two reports – one report is on violence; the other report tells doctors and nurses how to help women. dr claudia garcia-moreno, of the who, and professor charlotte watts, from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, wrote the reports.“for the first time we have compared data from all over the world on partner violence and sexual violence by non-partners and the effect of these sorts of violence on health,” said garcia-moreno. these included hiv and other sexually transmitted infections, depression, alcoholism, unwanted pregnancies and babies that are born too small.there were differences in the levels of violence against women in different regions of the world but, said garcia-moreno, “it is too high” everywhere. data from 81 countries shows that, even in rich countries, 23.2% of women will experience physical and/or sexual violence from a partner in their lives. the global figure for women attacked by partners was 30%.women report more sexual assaults and rapes by acquaintances or strangers in rich countries than elsewhere. the report says that 12.6% of women in wealthy countries will be sexually attacked by a non-partner in their lives. the percentage in africa is 11.9%.the report says that their previous research shows that better-educated women and working women are less likely to experience violence, but not in all regions. there is a need to change some attitudes, said watts. “in some societies, are certain forms of violence against women acceptable?” she asked. “in some societies, violence against women is not ok – but, in some societies, it is ok.”garcia-moreno said that the percentages show that we must pay more attention to this question. over the past ten years, more people see that there is a problem, she said, but “it is a complex problem. we don’t have a vaccine or a pill”.the who now recommends teaching doctors and nurses to recognize the signs of domestic violence and sexual assault. but they do not recommend asking every woman who arrives in a clinic if she has been the victim of violence.“if a woman comes back several times with injuries she doesn’t mention, you should ask her about domestic violence,” said garcia-moreno.nan
elementary	roger mckinlay is the former president of the royal institute of navigation. he says that our use of gps (global positioning system) technology is damaging our ability to  nd our way. òif we do not look after them, we will lose our natural navigation abilities because we rely on technology more and more,ó he wrote.mckinlay believes it will take a lot of time and money before navigation systems will be good enough for technologies such as driverless cars to become successful. he says we need better research into systems for navigation. also, children should learn to  nd their way using more traditional methods. òschools should teach navigation and map reading,ó he wrote.in 2012, 39% of adults in the uk had a smartphone. in 2015, 66% of adults had a smartphone. so most people now use gps technology. but mckinlay, a satellite communication and navigation consultant, believes that we should be careful not to only use our smartphones for navigation. òif we donõt practise using our navigation skills, we will lose them,ó he wrote.research from 2009 supports this idea. òwe studied a group of current london taxi drivers and a group of retired london taxi drivers,ó said dr hugo spiers of university college london, who is an author of the study. the results showed that the retired taxi drivers did worse on navigation tests than the current drivers. òwe were able to show that their abilities decreased after they stopped using their knowledge.óspiers also believes it is dangerous to rely on technologies like gps. but he says that the biggest problem is that technologies can lead drivers into dangerous situations. one of the deaths caused by satnavs (satellite navigation) was of a driver who, in 2010, drove into a lake in spain. òit can be dangerous to use a satnav,ó said spiers.the way we use navigation technology also has an impact on our own abilities, says spiers. if drivers listen to instructions, they donõt need to think about where they are going, he says, but the use of smartphone apps as digital maps is better. when you use digital maps, òyou have to think hard about where you are going,ó he said.mckinlay believes there have to be big improvements in navigation technologies before we can have futuristic things like driverless cars and smart cities. òfor really important jobs ð like landing aeroplanes or  ying aeroplanes ð gps is still not good enough,ó he said.mckinlay believes humans must still able to take control of their navigation. òwe donõt want people to go into total shock when their smartphone disappears or the battery goes  at,ó he said. òtechnology isnõt magic ð it is just a tool.ónan
elementary	a new scientific study says that global warming might make temperatures rise more than people think. the scientist who led the research said that, if emissions of greenhouse gases are not reduced, the planet will be at least 4c warmer by 2100. this is twice the level the worldõs governments consider to be dangerous.the research shows that fewer clouds form as the planet warms. this means that less sunlight reflects back into space and this makes temperatures even higher. the way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change.professor steven sherwood, at the university of new south wales in australia, who led the research, said that their work was new in two ways. first, it found what controls the cloud changes and, second, it did not accept the lowest estimates of future global warming; it believed the higher, more damaging estimates.ò4c would be catastrophic, not simply dangerous,ó sherwood said. òfor example, it would make life difficult, if not impossible, in much of the tropics and it would guarantee the eventual melting of the greenland ice sheet and some of the antarctic ice sheet.ó and, if the ice sheets melt, sea levels will rise by many metres.the research helps to show how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions, say scientists who have commented on the study, published in the journal nature. experts at japanõs national institute for environmental studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was a good one. they also agreed that this showed future climate change would be bigger than people think.to measure the effect of greenhouse gases on the earthõs climate, scientists estimate what the rise in temperature would be with twice as much co2 in the atmosphere as in the pre-industrial age ð and this will probably happen within 50 years. for twenty years, those estimates have been from 1.5c to 5c: a wide range. the new research has reduced that range to between 3c and 5c, by studying the biggest cause of uncertainty: clouds.researchers use computer climate models to predict future temperatures and it was important to include the way clouds form in those models. when water evaporates from the oceans, the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight; or, it may rise just a few miles and fall slowly back down without forming clouds. in reality, both things happen and climate models that include the second possibility predict much higher future temperatures than the models that only include the nine-mile-high clouds.òclimate sceptics like to criticize climate models because they are sometimes wrong, and we know that they are not perfect,ó said sherwood. òbut we are finding that the mistakes are being made by the models that predict less warming, not the models that predict more warming.ó he added: òsceptics may also point to the pause in the rise of temperatures since the end of the 20th century, but there is more and more evidence that we cannot see this pause in other measures of the climate system. and the pause is almost certainly temporary.óthe worlds average air temperatures have increased quite slowly since a high point in 1998, which the ocean phenomenon el nino caused. but, greenhouse gases are trapping more and more heat and over 90% disappears into the oceans. also, a recent study suggested that it may seem there is a pause, but this is only because we did not have temperature readings from polar regions, where there is the most warming. sherwood accepts that his teamõs work on the role of clouds does not mean for sure that temperature rises will be in the higher range. he added that a 4c rise in the worldõs average temperatures would have a serious effect on the world and the economies of many countries if we do not reduce emissions.
advanced	brazil’s latest funk sensation, anitta, has won millions of fans by taking the favela sound into the mainstream, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour.anti-discrimination campaigners and social commentators say the music industry’s fastest rising star has had to sacrifice her blackness to make it into the predominantly white middleclass market.the controversy was prompted by the publication of then-and-now photographs that show a dramatic lightening of anitta’s skin tone since she signed a deal with warner.in the first, when she was relatively unknown, she looked darker. in the second – a marketing shot after she became famous – she seems paler. whether this was the result of whitening products and cosmetic surgery or – more likely – photoshop tweaks, the contrast has rekindled discussion about whether you need to be pale to get ahead in brazil.jarid arraes, a psychology student and blogger, wrote a post criticizing the latent discrimination in media and marketing that she felt anitta’s image change represented. “people refuse to accept that they are racist and they think they live in a multiracial democracy, but the statistics show that is far from the case. the whitening shows us a profoundly intolerant society that doesn’t support diversity. white is the image of the rich, the nice, the successful, the good, while people see black as the opposite of all that.”born larissa de macedo machado, the diva-to-be was a church chorister in her childhood. in her teens, she made a name for herself in rio de janeiro’s baile funk scene as a dancer and singer.she has now exploded into the public consciousness with an album and a huge hit single, show das poderosas, which topped the charts and attracted 52 million youtube views.though adored first and foremost as a pop idol with a strong message and some catchy tunes, her backers project her as a cultural bridge between the predominantly black and mixed-race shanty towns on rio’s hillsides and the wealthier and whiter communities below.she has toned down the suggestive dancing, gangsta references and explicit lyrics of baile funk. now, however, questions are being asked about whether she – or her marketing team – have gone too far in re-tailoring her image to attract a more lucrative demographic. “if pop stars have curly hair, they are going to feel coerced into straightening it. if they have a big nose, they will be coerced into getting rhinoplasty,” said arraes. “it creates a vicious cycle for self-esteem.”this is a sensitive topic in this largely mixed-raced nation. brazil – one of the last big countries in the world to ban slavery – has the largest population of african descent outside africa, but race and ancestry are less important here than colour. and, despite the nation’s goal of being a multiracial democracy, there is a clear link between skin tone and inequality.in brazilian cities, white workers earn roughly twice as much as those of african descent. up until 2011, black or mixed-race students also spent two years less at school on average.the government says the gap is closing thanks to quota systems for university places and other forms of affirmative action. but the gulf remains glaringly apparent. the vast majority of business and government executives are white, while most menial jobs are done by black and mixed-race workers. walk through ipanema, gávea or other upmarket districts and you are far more likely to see black nannies pushing strollers with white toddlers than a white nanny pushing a black child.defining colour is complex. people who define themselves as white were in the minority for the first time in the most recent census in 2010. among the 197 million population, 82 million said they were “pardu” (mixed race), 15 million black, two million asian and 0.5% indigenous.sylvio ferreira, a psychology lecturer at the federal university of pernambuco, believes anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it tamer and more palatable to everyone.“was this achieved by racial whitening? no,” he said. “what happened was a change of the social space where anitta produced her art: from the periphery to the centre.”others agree that the issue of colour is overblown. maycon de mattos batista, a financial analyst who worked with anitta while she was an intern, said there had been a huge change in anitta’s image, but not of her colour.“i don’t believe it’s whitening; it’s more the way they are producing her with makeup, hairstylists and the way she dresses,” he said. “i don’t think that was because of pressure being put on her. she always liked to show off, sing and dance. that was a natural thing for her. i believe that it is because of this naturalness that she is where she is today.”leandro silva de souza, a racial equality activist in the north-eastern city of salvador, said the prejudice lay not with society but with music producers and media executives. the public, he said, proved they were interested in music for its own sake by choosing ellen oléria – a black lesbian – as the recent winner of the talent show the voice brazil.the guardian was unable to reach anitta for comment. but, in a recent interview, she described the need for identity to be self-defined.“all-powerful is a woman who doesn’t need to be beautiful, but she has so much attitude that she is marvellous, she is powerful. what i try to pass on in my work for everyone is that we can be who we want.”
advanced	low-income countries will remain on the front line of human-induced climate change over the next century, experiencing gradual sea-level rises, stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rainfall, and larger and longer heatwaves, according to the most thorough assessment of the issue yet.the last major united nations (un) assessment, in 2007, predicted runaway temperature rises of 6 °c or more by the end of the century. that is now thought unlikely by scientists, but average land and sea temperatures are expected to continue rising throughout this century, possibly reaching 4 °c above present levels – enough to devastate crops and make life in many cities unbearably hot.as temperatures climb and oceans warm, tropical and subtropical regions will face sharp changes in annual rainfall, says the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) report, released in stockholm and published online in september.east africa can expect to experience increased short rains, while west africa should expect heavier monsoons. burma, bangladesh and india can expect stronger cyclones; elsewhere in southern asia, heavier summer rains are anticipated. indonesia may receive less rainfall between july and october, but the coastal regions around the south china sea and gulf of thailand can expect increased rainfall extremes when cyclones hit land.“it is virtually certain that, in the long term, global precipitation will change. high latitude countries, such as in europe or north america, are expected to receive more rainfall, but many subtropical arid and semi-arid regions will likely experience less precipitation. over wet tropical regions, extreme precipitation events will very likely be more intense and more frequent in a warmer world,” said the report’s authors.they added: “monsoon onset dates are likely to become earlier or not to change much while monsoon withdrawal rates are very likely to delay, resulting in a lengthening of the season.”scientists in developing countries and commentators have welcomed the report, which they said backed their own observations.“the ipcc makes the case that climate change is real and happening much more strongly than before. we are already seeing the effects of climate change in bangladesh and across south asia. it’s not news to us. most developing countries are facing climate change now. they do not need the ipcc to tell them that the weather is changing,” said saleemul huq, director of the international centre for climate change and development, based in dhaka.scientists have also lowered projections of sea-level rises. depending on future greenhouse gas emissions, sea levels will rise an average of 40–62 cm by 2100. nevertheless, there will be signifi cant geographical variations; many millions of people living in the developing world’s great cities, including lagos and calcutta, are threatened.weather disasters are also more likely in a warmer world, the report suggests. although the global frequency of tropical cyclones is expected to decrease or remain essentially unchanged, they may become more intense, with stronger winds and heavier rainfall.life in many developing-country cities could become practically unbearable, given that urban temperatures are already well above those in surrounding countryside. much higher temperatures could reduce the length of the growing period in some parts of africa by up to 20%, the report said.dr camilla toulmin, director of the international institute for environment and development, says: “climate models are not yet robust enough to predict impacts at local and regional scales, but it is clear that everybody is vulnerable in some way.”the charity oxfam predicted that world hunger would worsen as climate changes inevitably hurt crop production and disrupt incomes. they suggested the number of people at risk of hunger might climb by 10% to 20% by 2050, with daily per-capita calorie availability falling across the world.“the changing climate is already jeopardizing gains in the fi ght against hunger, and it looks set to worsen,” said oxfam. “a hot world is a hungry world. if the remainder of the 21st century unfolds like its fi rst decade, we will soon experience climate extremes well outside the boundaries of human experience.”
advanced	the threatened extinction of the tiger in india, the perilous existence of the orangutan in indonesia, the plight of the panda: these are wildlife emergencies with which we have become familiar. they are well-loved animals that no one wants to see disappear. but, now, scientists fear the real impact of declining wildlife could be closer to home, with the threat to creatures such as ladybirds posing the gravest danger to biodiversity.climate change, declining numbers of animals, rising numbers of humans and the rapid rate of species extinction mean a growing number of scientists now declare us to be in the anthropocene – the geological age of extinction when humans finally dominate the ecosystems.wwf’s living planet index (lpi) 2014 seemed to confirm that grim picture, with statistics on the world’s wildlife population that showed a dramatic reduction in numbers across countless species. the lpi showed the number of vertebrates had declined by 52% over four decades. biodiversity loss has now reached “critical levels”. some populations of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians have suffered even bigger losses, with freshwater species declining by 76% over the same period. but it’s the creatures that provide the most “natural capital” or “ecosystem services” that are getting many scientists really worried. three quarters of the world’s food production is thought to depend on bees and other pollinators such as hoverflies. never mind how cute a panda is or how stunning a tiger – it’s worms that are grinding up our waste and taking it deep into the soil to turn into nutrients, and bats that are catching mosquitoes and keeping malaria rates down. a study in north america has valued the loss of pest control from ongoing bat declines at more than $22bn in lost agricultural productivity.“it’s the loss of the common species that will impact on people, not so much the rarer creatures because, by the very nature of their rarity, we’re not reliant on them in such an obvious way,” said dr nick isaac, a macroecologist at the centre for ecology & hydrology in oxfordshire. he says that recent work he and colleagues have been doing suggests that britain’s insects and other invertebrates are declining just as fast as vertebrates, with “serious consequences for humanity”. “the really interesting thing about this work is that we are learning that it’ s not just about the numbers of species going extinct, but the actual numbers in a population; that’ s the beginning of a fundamental shift in our understanding,” he says.he pointed to the fact that between 23 and 36% of all birds, mammals and amphibians used for food or medicine are now threatened with extinction. in many parts of the world, wildanimal food sources are a critical part of the diet, particularly for the poor.the blame, most agree, sits with unsustainable human consumption damaging ecosystems, creating climate change and destroying habitats at a far faster rate than previously thought. but, this time, it’s not just the “big, cuddly mammals” we have to worry about losing but the smaller, less visible creatures upon which we depend – insects, creepycrawlies and even worms. they might not be facing immediate extinction but a decline in their numbers will affect us all. “we are going to feel the impact of those losses. with the uk species, the pattern is much the same with invertebrates as it is with vertebrates. it’s not as simplistic as ‘fish die and people starve’ – it’s more complex,” said isaac.humans, said tv naturalist sir david attenborough in 2013, are a “plague on earth”, but wwf claims there is still time to stop the rot. its uk chief executive, david nussbaum, said: “the scale of the destruction highlighted in this report should act as a wake-up call for us all. we all – politicians, business and people – have an interest, and a responsibility, to act to ensure we protect what we all value: a healthy future for people and nature.“humans are cutting down trees more quickly than they can regrow, harvesting more fish than the oceans can restock, pumping water from our rivers and aquifers faster than rainfall can replenish them and emitting more carbon than the oceans and forests can absorb,” he said.
advanced	himalayan lakes, spacewalks and the presidential primaries helped scott kelly keep his wits over 340 days in space, the astronaut told journalists, after he landed back on earth from a record-setting mission. òit seemed like i lived there forever,ó kelly said. the veteran of past missions said that his biggest surprise was simply how long this one felt. òmaybe, occasionally, you do go bananas,ó he said.kelly and a russian counterpart, mikhail kornienko, spent nearly a year on the international space station (iss) in order to study the effects of weightlessness, radiation and the cramped quarters of space ight on humans ð research nasa considers essential for an eventual mission to mars.kelly said the length of the mission was its biggest challenge and that he felt signi cantly more sore on returning to gravity than after shorter trips. kelly and his twin brother, mark, a retired astronaut, have spent the last year taking physical and mental tests. the tests will continue, to help nasa learn about how the body copes with the severe strains of space ight.kelly said he felt aches and had extremely sensitive skin but, so far, his balance has felt mostly decent. however, he said, òthe  rst thing i tried to throw on a table i missedó because òyou tend to underestimate the effects of gravityó.he said the discomfort of returning to gravity ð which shrank him back down to normal height after he stretched by 1.5 inches in orbit ð took nothing away from the awe he felt after his capsule landed back on earth. when the russian capsule opened on to the cool air of kazakhstan, kelly said, he smelled òa fragrance like a plant was blooming in that areaó. it was the fresh air mingled with the charred, òkind of sweetó smell of a spacecraft that had survived re-entry through the atmosphere.backing away from the vessel, he said, the scope of the mission began to sink in: 340 days on a 15-year-old space station which is òa million pounds, the size of a football  eld, the internal volume, some say, of a six-bedroom houseó. the iss, he said, is a place that uses the power of the sun and was built with the help of an international team and millions of taxpayers.òthere are things weõre going to discover about our experience in space in the space station that we donõt even know now,ó kelly said, comparing the research of more than 450 missions there to the work done by computer scientists at nasa in the 1960s and 1970s. he added: òthe view is great, too.ókelly made the most of that view, posting spectacular photos on social media of the earthõs cities, landscapes, oceans and atmosphere. òthe earth is a beautiful planet,ó he said, describing the striking colours of the waters around the bahamas and the rainbow hues of lakes that dot the northern himalayas. he said he would like to visit that region, though he would  rst need to learn òwhat country actually owns themó. but, òpredominantly, you just notice how thin the atmosphere is, how fragile it looks,ó kelly added. òthat, combined with these large swathes of pollution, is kind of alarming.ó the astronaut said he could see entire systems of pollution: smoke clouds from wild res that covered parts of the us, sections of asia with continuous, visible pollution nearly all year round. he said the message òwe need to save the planetó slightly missed the point: òthe planet will get better; itõs us that wonõt be here because weõll destroy the environment.ó the worldõs thin shield of atmosphere òmakes you more of an environmentalist after spending so much time looking downó, he said.òitõs for us to take care of the air we breathe and the water we drink. and i do believe we have an impact on that and we do have the ability to change it, if we make the decision to.ó kellyõs active social- media life, which he said was a joint effort with his girlfriend, earned him a huge online following. but he said he was unaware of it, instead he was watching the chaotic drama of the 2016 presidential election. one of the  rst questions he asked the crew who lifted him out of a space capsule was òhow did super tuesday go?óbut the astronaut demurred when asked for his thoughts on the likes of donald trump and bernie sanders. òi would say that, as a government employee, i am subject to the hatch act,ó he said, referring to a law that prohibits some political activity for federal employees. òso i canõt say how i think of all the news stories of all the year.óbesides the news, he said, steady work helped keep him sane: òi tried to have milestones that were close, like when is the next crew arriving, the next spacewalk, the next robotics, the next science experiment. that made a difference to me, keeping my sanity.ó being back on earth with the rest of humanity had not quite sunk in, he added, recalling how shocked he had been to see a crowd of people after a previous mission. òthereõll be a point here pretty soon where iõll start feeling that kind of culture shock,ó he said.although a nasa scientist said kelly embodied the qualities needed for a mission to mars, the astronaut himself predicted that he would not  y again with the space agency. òbut i donõt think i would ever say iõm absolutely, 100% done,ó he added, noting the sudden successes of private space ight companies such as spacex. òthey might need a guy like me someday,ó he said. òmaybe, in the next 20 years, youõll be able to buy a cheap ticket, just go for a little visit.ó
advanced	he is the star of one of the world’s longest running and most successful film series, with 23 movies and more than $6bn amassed at the global box office, but james bond shows no signs of slowing down. in fact, the bond brand is stronger than ever, after the record-breaking performance of skyfall, which became the biggest ever film at the uk box office on its release in 2012 and, with its total earnings of $1.1bn, currently stands in ninth place of all-time largest earners.hence the intense interest that surrounded the announcement of a few more details of the 24th bond film – not the least its official title, spectre. the number one question is this: can spectre repeat the skyfall trick? will skyfall remain a high water mark for the bond movie or can spectre extend this winning run?charles gant, film editor for heat magazine, says the indications are it is heading in the right direction. “skyfall was a brilliant strategic move,” he says. “it was cleverly positioned as simultaneously modern and retro. it appealed to the daniel-craig-era fans, who are relative newcomers to the franchise, and it also managed to engage the older, more nostalgic elements of the audience, who may have lost interest over the previous few films. with the new title,” he adds, “they are already on to a winner. my feeling is that spectre announces that they want to hang on to the nostalgic, more age-diverse bond fan, as well as retaining the younger audience.”the initial signs are that eon productions, the company originally founded in 1961 to make dr no and that is behind all the “official” bonds, is doing its utmost to ensure lightning strikes twice by installing the key creative talent behind skyfall on spectre. daniel craig has been tied down at least until bond 25, while the same writers have produced the script.but it’s the recapture of director sam mendes that gives bondwatchers the most hope. a director principally known for character studies such as american beauty and revolutionary road, mendes has taken the bond series to new heights. gant says: “mendes managed to engage with both the modern and the traditional bond audience, and he also pulled in high-calibre actors like ralph fiennes. to get actors like fiennes in, they have to be happy with the director.”among other achievements, skyfall virtually doubled the box office of its predecessor, quantum of solace, which managed a worldwide figure of $586m on its release in 2008. no one is expecting anything like that this time, but eon will not be complacent.though the bond series was not in trouble before mendes’s arrival – and craig’s – there was the sense of a certain amount of staleness towards the end of pierce brosnan’s run. the series had survived the drying up of actual bond stories to adapt, the movies having long since departed from any resemblance to the ian fleming originals, but it was lacking a certain dynamism.this cycle, however, was nothing new: the history of the bond series has been one of ebb and flow, stasis and renewal, revolving most obviously around the lead actor: first, sean connery; then, successively, george lazenby, roger moore, timothy dalton, brosnan and, now, craig. each appointment has been a response to the state of the series and some have worked out better than others.lazenby only lasted a single film, while dalton’s two efforts, the living daylights and licence to kill coincided with a period in the late 80s when the 007 movie had been thoroughly eclipsed by more aggressive, slickly produced hollywood action movies. according to gant, “the period of roger moore’s last ones, going into dalton, didn’t really excite audiences. brosnan saw a bit of an upturn commercially, while craig has taken it to new levels. on the other hand, the early bonds were incredibly commercial films, sexy and exciting, and there was very little around like them.”it’s a point worth underlining that, although skyfall’s actual receipts dwarf all the other bond films, the performance of some of the 1960s entries in the series was almost as brilliant by comparison. with figures adjusted for inflation, the 1965 release, thunderball, is only a hair’s breadth below skyfall, while goldfinger and you only live twice both outperformed the other craig films (as did the 70s bonds, the spy who loved me and live and let die). by this reckoning, licence to kill is the worst-performing of all bonds, with moore’s final effort, a view to a kill, in second-to-last place.nevertheless, the bond brand has remained immensely powerful over the decades, with eon being forced to fend off attempts by rival outfits to capitalize on the series’s popularity. through a quirk of rights ownership, adaptations of casino royale (in 1967) and thunderball (as never say never again, in 1983) were released in competition with eon productions. although subject to legal disputes over several decades, eon now has full control of both books.casino royale, whose rights had been individually sold off by fleming in 1955, eventually passed to eon in 1999 as a result of an agreement between eon’s backers, mgm, and rival hollywood studio sony – thereby clearing the way for the 2006 version. thunderball, on the other hand, owed its disputed status to writer-producer kevin mcclory, who helped fleming outline the original story and who claimed ownership of the novel over subsequent decades, and produced never say never again as a result. after mcclory’s death in 2006, his family eventually settled with mgm and eon’s parent company in november 2013.if the initial surge of enthusiasm for bond movies lasted through the 60s and into the 1970s, it’s fair to say that the series almost ground to a halt after licence to kill’s poor figures. goldeneye, the first of brosnan’s efforts, heralded a dramatic renewal: not simply because of a new actor but, more significantly, because of who was behind the camera.however, after a six-year break, eon installed martin campbell in the chair: another experienced british director but one who was able to orchestrate one of the most elaborate stunts in bond history. the justly renowned opening scene of goldeneye – during which bond freefalls into the cockpit of a pilotless light aeroplane – did much to reinvigorate and modernize the series on its own. moreover, a whole new generation was reached through a hugely successful goldeneye video-game spin-off, making a significant contribution to perceptions that the bond film was no longer stale and old-fashioned.
advanced	the canadian tennis player frank dancevic slammed australian open organizers for forcing players to compete in “inhumane” conditions after he collapsed on court as temperatures rose to 41c.dancevic, who collapsed during the second set of his first-round match against france’s benoît paire on the uncovered court six at melbourne park and passed out for a minute, said conditions were plainly dangerous for the players. he also said the heat had caused him to hallucinate: “i was dizzy from the middle of the first set and then i saw snoopy and i thought, ‘wow, snoopy – that’s weird.’”“i think it’s inhumane. i don’t think it’s fair to anybody – to the players, to the fans, to the sport – when you see players pulling out of matches, passing out,” he added. “i’ve played five-set matches all my life and being out there for a set and a half and passing out with heat stroke, it’s not normal.“having players with so many problems and complaining to the tournament that it’s too hot to play; until somebody dies, they just keep going on with it and putting matches on in this heat. i, personally, don’t think it’s fair and i know a lot of players don’t think it’s fair.”other players were in broad agreement. the british number one, andy murray, said: “it’s definitely something that you have to look at a little bit. as much as it’s easy to say the conditions are safe, it only takes one bad thing to happen. and it looks terrible for the whole sport when people are collapsing, ball kids are collapsing, people in the stands are collapsing. that’s not great.“i know when i went out to hit before the match, the conditions at 2.30–3pm were very, very tough. whether it’s safe or not, i don’t know. there’s been some issues in other sports with players having heart attacks.”caroline wozniacki said: “i put the water bottle down on the court and it started melting a little bit underneath the plastic. so, you know it was warm.”john isner, who retired from his first-round match with a right ankle injury, said: “it was like an oven when i open the oven and the potatoes are done. that’s what it’s like.”the defending champion victoria azarenka took the same line. “it felt pretty hot, like you’re dancing in a frying pan or something like that,” she said.the tournament’s “extreme heat” contingency plan was put into force for women’s matches on tuesday, allowing an extra ten-minute break between the second and third sets. under a change to the rules for 2014, however, the decision on whether to stop matches at the tournament is now at the discretion of the tournament director, wayne mckewen.rather than use the raw celsius readings to assess the heat, organizers prefer to use the wet bulb globe temperature composite, which also gauges humidity and wind to identify the perceived conditions. organizers said temperatures peaked at 42.2c in the early evening on tuesday and conditions had never reached the point where play would be stopped.“we have to reach a minimum threshold and have a forecast that it will be sustained for a reasonable time,” mckewen said in a statement. “that didn’t happen. while conditions were hot and uncomfortable, the relatively low level of humidity ensured play would continue.”dancevic, who said he had felt dizzy from the middle of the second set, resumed after medical attention but, unsurprisingly, ended up losing 7–6, 6–3, 6–4. “i was really close to stopping completely,” he said. “i wasn’t really running too much towards the end. i wasn’t tired; i just felt my body temperature was too high.”a ball boy had earlier required medical attention after collapsing during milos raonic’s 7–6, 6–1, 4–6, 6–2 victory over daniel gimeno-traver on the equally exposed court eight and the tournament shortened rotations for the ball boys to 45-minute shifts. china’s peng shuai also said the heat had caused her to cramp up and vomit, and she had to be helped from the court after her 7–5, 4–6, 6–3 defeat to japan’s kurumi nara.officials played down health risks, saying the majority of matches were completed without calls for medical attention.“of course, there were a few players who experienced heat-related illness or discomfort, but none required significant medical intervention after they had completed their match,” tim wood, the tournament’s chief medical officer, said in a statement.most competitors, though, followed roger federer’s line that, although conditions were tough, they were the same for both players. “it’s just a mental thing,” the swiss said, albeit before dancevic collapsed. “if you’ve trained hard enough your entire life, or the last few weeks, and you believe you can do it and come through it, there’s no reason. if you can’t deal with it, you throw in the towel.”dancevic disagreed. “i don’t think it’s much to do with the shape the players are in. some players are used to the heat – their bodies can genetically handle the heat and others’ can’t,” he said. “it’s hazardous to be out there; it’s dangerous. it’s an hour and a half since my match and i still can’t pee.”
advanced	the beginning of the year is probably prime-time for feeling glum about work: it’s ages until the next holiday, and it’s dark in the morning and when you get home. and, if you’re stuck in a job you don’t like, it could be enough to have you reaching for your cv. but, before you start hunting through the job ads, try to put things in perspective. so, what else could you be doing instead? we asked fi ve people doing some unusual jobs how much they are paid, what the worst parts are and why they enjoy their work.1. dog-food taster the job: tasting dog food to make sure it meets a premium brand’s quality standardswhat it involves: opening sample tins of each freshly made batch of dog (or cat) food, smelling it and eating it. “although dogs’ palates are different from ours, taste is an important quality check to ensure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced in just the right way,” says philip wells, the chief taster for lily’s kitchen pet food. “trying the food is also a good way to pick up on the nuances of the cooking; this works especially well on the dry food.”typical salary: £20,000 for an entry-level job in the quality department. however, wells says £50,000 or more is “easily achievable” for an experienced technical director who, as well as tasting products, is also likely to be responsible for developing new recipes and advising the business on technical and regulatory matters.worst part of the job: the deadlines, for wells, who admits he quite likes the food. the meat used in pet food has to be derived from animals passed as fi t for human consumption, under the animal feed regulations 2010, and he says the fi rm uses “human-grade freshly prepared raw food” in its recipes. he adds: “there are some pretty gruesome pet foods out there and, although i don’t taste them, the smell is enough to turn the stomach when i do a bit of market research.”job satisfaction: “no two days are ever the same.” it’s rewarding, wells says, that a project he has worked on will “help pets to become happier and healthier”. however, he acknowledges that some of the credit must go to another “key member” of the tasting team: lily, the border terrier.2. hygiene technician the job: disinfecting areas that have potentially been exposed to bio-hazardous situationswhat it involves: cleaning up crime scenes, road accidents and suicides. clearing hoarders’ houses full of rubbish, rats and excrement … among other things. “the job is about keeping people safe,” says richard lewis, a hygiene technician for rentokil. “we deal with some very disturbingly dirty sites.”typical salary: the entry-level salary is usually around £14,500 and a top salary can be up to £22,000.worst part of the job: cleaning up after suicides. “you get used to the job being disgusting but the emotional side of it is still hard.” you learn not to take your work home with you, he says. “you also need to have a sense of humour, as some days can be tough.”job satisfaction: lewis fi nds the variety of tasks exciting. “one day, i’m cleaning up after a dead body; another day, i’m in a prison cell or 100 feet in the air being lowered down into a silo to clean it.” he also takes pride in the transformation he brings about: “it’s satisfying to return a potentially hazardous site back to a safe environment. and it benefi ts society.”3. biogas engineer the job: setting up biogas plants in developing countrieswhat it involves: linking a system of digesters – which can be fi lled with human excrement, animal dung and other waste products – to toilets to produce a biogas that can be used for cooking and lighting. “you have to know what size and shape the mixing pit needs to be, how to create the optimum temperature for digestion and where to situate the biogas plant,” says baburam paudel, chief technical offi cer in nepal for the charity renewable world. “you also have to convince poor communities that poo can be productive – many are repelled by the idea of connecting their toilets to their kitchens.”typical salary: an entry-level salary is around £10,000, while a typical salary for a chief technical offi cer is £30,000.worst part of the job: for paudel, it’s seeing people struggling to survive on very little income. but, he admits, anyone who won’t change a nappy would struggle. “you have to be willing to get your hands dirty during the build process and inspections. unsurprisingly, the anaerobic digestion (the process that takes place when bacteria eat the decomposing waste and produce methane) smells like rotten eggs. it can be disgusting and there is no room for mistakes.”job satisfaction: “i fi nd it immensely satisfying to know that i am helping people to increase their incomes and allowing girls to attend school by replacing the need to collect fi rewood,” says paudel. “my work improves the health and hygiene of whole communities.”4. eel ecologist the job: conserving the critically endangered european eelwhat it involves: to monitor the size of the endangered eels, ecologists wade into the thames and other london rivers and marshes full of eels, sometimes up to their armpits, and reach into a net fi lled with up to 20 adult eels to grab one with their bare hands. “adult eels can be a metre long, or even larger, and weigh up to 2kg. they’re not at all dangerous but they are almost pure muscle and they can be a little bit slimy,” says stephen mowat, an eel conservationist and ecologist for the zoological society of london. “we have to weigh and measure them, and they wriggle … a lot. it’s diffi cult to look professional while crawling on the ground chasing an eel across the grass.”worst part of the job: “eels are really tricky creatures to work with – and getting outsmarted by an eel can be quite embarrassing,” says mowat. “you also have to be ready to jump from one project to the next. i once had to dissect a tub of dead eels to examine parasites living in them, moments before jumping into a suit for a meeting with government offi cials. i remembered to wash my hands.” but, for mowat, the worst part of the job is defi nitely not handling the eels – he believes baby eels (known as elvers) are “as cute as pandas”: “the worst thing about the job is regularly learning how much damage we, the british population, are doing to the environment.”job satisfaction: “getting to work outdoors and seeing british wildlife up close is the best part of the job,” says mowat. “eels are beautiful creatures and working with eels doesn’t just benefi t the eel: it helps whole river systems, estuaries and coastal habitats. that is something worth working on.”5. shopping channel presenter the job: selling and demonstrating a wide range of products on live tvwhat it involves: presenting hours and hours of monotonous content, while simultaneously demonstrating the products and appearing to be enthusiastic and knowledgeable about everything that you’re selling. “i prepare and research as much technical and practical information as possible on every single product beforehand,” says shaun ryan, presenter for ideal world tv. “but you also need the ability to relate to every genre of products and to every viewer.”typical salary: a trainee presenter would start on a minimum of £30,000, while an experienced presenter can expect over £55,000.worst part of the job: “the unsociable hours,” says ryan. “an experienced presenter like myself generally gets to work prime-time hours, which means all weekends, bank holidays and very late evenings, plus the occasional 5am shift.” his worst task ever, he says, was singlehandedly having to sell some female slimming pants: “it was a very tricky hour and not my fi nest.”job satisfaction: “i love the rush of live presenting and having to think on my feet every second,” says ryan. “i also get an adrenaline rush from knowing that, at times, i have thousands of viewers ordering the product that i have just been presenting.”
advanced	the virunga national park, home to rare mountain gorillas but targeted for oil exploration by a british company, could earn trouble-torn dr congo $400m a year from tourism, hydropower and carbon credits, said a wwf report.but, if the unesco world heritage site that straddles the equator is exploited for oil, as the congolese government and exploration firm soco international are hoping, it could lead to devastating pollution and permanent conflict in an already unstable region, says the conservation body.soco international is the only company seeking to explore inside the boundaries of the virunga park. soco insist that their operations in congo would be confined to an area in the park known as block v, and would not affect the gorillas.soco chairman rui de sousa said: “despite the views of wwf, soco is extremely sensitive to the environmental significance of the virunga national park. it is irrefutable that oil companies still have a central role in today’s global energy supply and a successful oil project has the potential to transform the economic and social well-being of a whole country.’’he added: “the park has sadly been in decline for many years, officially falling below the standards required for a world heritage site. the potential for development just might be the catalyst that reverses this trend.’’however, raymond lumbuenamo, country director for wwf democratic republic of the congo, based in kinshassa, said that security in and around the park would deteriorate further if soco went ahead with its exploration plans.“the security situation is already bad. the un is involved with fighting units and the m23 rebel force is inside the park. oil would be a curse. it always increases conflict. it would attract human sabotage. the park might become like the niger delta. developing virunga for oil will not make anything better.“the population there is already very dense, with over 350 people per square kilometre. when you take part of the land (for oil), you put more pressure on the rest. oil would not provide many jobs; people would flood in looking for work,” he said.one fear is that the area is seismically active and another eruption of one of the volcanoes in the park could damage oil company infrastructure and lead to oil spills in the lakes. “virunga’s rich natural resources are for the benefit of the congolese people, not for foreign oil prospectors to drain away. our country’s future depends on sustainable economic development,” said lumbuenamo.“for me, choosing the conservation option is the best option. once you have started drilling for oil, there’s no turning back,” he said.but lumbuenamo accepted that, while the gorillas were safe at present, the chances of the park generating its potential of $400m a year were remote. “it would be difficult to make the kind of money that the report talks of. virunga used to be a very peaceful place and can be again. the security situation right now is bad. the un is involved with fighting units. it’s not as quiet as it used to be.”according to the wwf report, ecosystems in the park could support hydropower generation, fishing and ecotourism, and play an important role in providing secure water supplies, regulating climate and preventing soil erosion.the park, africa’s oldest and most diverse, is home to over 3,000 different kinds of animals, but is now heavily populated with desperately poor people, many of whom fled there after the rwanda massacre in 1994.“in all, the park could support in the region of 45,000 permanent jobs. in addition, people around the world could get an immense value from simply knowing that the park is well managed and is safe for future generations,” says the report.“virunga represents a valuable asset to dr congo and contributes to africa’s heritage as the oldest and most biodiverse park on the continent,” the report continues. “plans to explore for oil and exploit oil reserves put virunga’s potential value at risk,” it says.“this is where we draw the line. oil companies are standing on the doorstep of one of the world’s most precious and fragile places, but we will not rest until virunga is safe from this potential environmental disaster,” said lasse gustavsson, executive director of wwf international. “virunga has snow fields and lava fields, but it should not have oil fields.”the unesco world heritage committee called for the cancellation of all virunga oil permits and appealed to concession holders total sa and soco international plc not to undertake exploration in world heritage sites. total has committed to respecting virunga’s current boundary, leaving uk-based soco as the only oil company with plans to explore inside the park.
advanced	ever since he was diagnosed hiv positive, moses king, 48, has had one major problem. he has been able to cope with the stigma of being hiv positive – widespread in liberia – and he was able to access antiretroviral medication, provided by the global fund to fight aids, tuberculosis and malaria and distributed by the liberian government. but king and his family of six children could not get the right food to eat. a subsistence farmer, he grew vegetables and bought rice. but meat and fish – expensive, luxury products in liberian markets but essential sources of protein – remained elusive.“subsistence farming allowed us to survive, but we had so many problems,” said king. “we could not get any protein, and we were not getting the nutrients we needed to sustain ourselves.”pate k chon, a counsellor who works with hiv sufferers in liberia, provided an unlikely solution. since watching a documentary about a fish farm in thailand several years earlier, she had thought of setting up a similar project in liberia, enabling hiv sufferers to have work and also access a stable source of protein.“i saw this film about fish in a cement pool and i thought it was a good idea,” said chon, herself diagnosed with hiv in 1992. “so many of the people i work with don’t have the means to have a balanced protein diet and fish is such a clean source of protein – it doesn’t cause health problems like other sources, and it is something we can farm.”chon, founder of a faith-based ngo, began building a pool in which to farm fish. in june 2012, chon met john sheehy, a ‘strategic philanthropist’ and founder of consultancy emerging business lab, who raised money for the non-profit fish farm in the northeast of monrovia, liberia’s capital, and set about learning aquaculture, doing an online course through cornell university and speaking to other fish farmers in africa.“i raised the money and built the farm, learned the proper tank layout and water flow system,” said sheehy. “a lot of my knowledge was self-taught, and now i would love to be able to write a manual and share it with other people,” he added.the project has now grown into the grow2feed liberia fish farm, with 12 tanks, which, when fully stocked, will each have 5,000 fish – providing up to 200,000 fish per year, serving a community of 1,200 predominantly hiv-positive people, including king and his family.in addition to the fish, waste from the tanks is collected and used to irrigate crops, also providing food and income for the community, made up of 503 women, 206 men and 346 children.“the members of the community live near the farm, and have agreed to be part of the co-operative,” said sheehy. “many work on the farm, or tending the crops, and what they get in return – when the fish are fully grown after 90 days – is fish. they can use those fish to feed themselves and to sell in the market so that they get money to buy other staple items.“the fish farm gives these people with hiv a way of getting back into society – now they are bartering and trading with people in the market every week.”according to liberia’s demographic health survey, 1.5% of liberia’s 3.5 million people are hiv positive, with 60% of those women or girls. stigma and discrimination still surround the illness, and have led to around half of all cases in the country going untreated.good nutrition is particularly important for people with hiv. research has shown they need much higher levels of protein to prevent their health from deteriorating and to allow healthy growth. “nutrition is one of the key things if you are taking antiretroviral drugs,” said chon. “the drugs are toxic and, if you don’t have food to eat, they can make you very ill. but food in liberia is very expensive. we buy expensive imported rice, even though we should be growing it ourselves and fish is difficult for most people to afford.”sheehy says grow2feed is the first co-operative fish farm in liberia to operate for the benefit of an hiv-positive community. the project has attracted the interest of the liberian government, and the un food and agriculture organization, which has worked with grow2feed to provide training, will also support teaching at the university of liberia.fish farming experts say the practice has huge potential in africa.“fish farming is absolutely viable in africa,” said paul white, owner of the hydrofish fish farm in ivory coast, which produces 3,000 tonnes of fish each year. “a lot of the fish on the market comes from china and is imported frozen. it is of a quality that could never enter europe or america. there has been a serious lack of investment and a lack of know-how in fish production. it is all coming to the forefront now,” he added.some critics are sceptical of farmed fish, citing inbred fish and high levels of toxins. but sheehy said good practice mitigated these problems. “a lot of farmed fish is inbred, which does cause problems, but we are using a process with local fish sourced in liberia, not fish from another region,” said sheehy. “that means we can continue using local fish to bring in new broodstock. “and we are not using lakes that are cornered off, where the fish absorb all the toxins in the lake. we can control the environment using the tanks, and we test the water and monitor it constantly.sheehy hopes to replicate the model throughout liberia and the region. “a rice-growing co-op in sierra leone asked us if we could do this on our property so that they can feed their workers and we have had interest from nigeria and central america,” said sheehy. “but we operate 100% non-profit and we will never lose our social justice aspect.”
advanced	"the moroccan city of ouarzazate is used to big productions. on the edge of the sahara desert and at the centre of the north african countryõs òouallywoodó  lm industry, it has played host to big-budget location shots in lawrence of arabia, the mummy, the living daylights and even game of thrones.now, the trading city, nicknamed the òdoor of the desertó, is the location for another blockbuster ð a complex of four linked solar mega-plants, which, alongside hydro and wind, will help provide nearly half of moroccoõs electricity from renewables by 2020 with, it is hoped, some spare to export to europe. the project is a key plank in moroccoõs ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower.when the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world and the  rst phase, called noor 1, will go live in november 2015. the mirror technology it uses is less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that are now familiar on roofs the world over but it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down.the potential for solar power from the desert has been known for decades. in the days after the chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, the german particle physicist gerhard knies calculated that the worldõs deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to provide for humanityõs power needs for a whole year. the challenge, though, has been capturing that energy and transporting it to the population centres where it is required.as engineers put the  nishing touches to noor 1, its 500,000 crescent-shaped solar mirrors glitter across the desert skyline. the 800 rows follow the sun as it tracks across the heavens, whirring quietly every few minutes as their shadows slip further east.when they are  nished, the four plants at ouarzazate will occupy a space as big as moroccoõs capital city, rabat, and generate 580 mega-watts (mw) of electricity, enough to power a million homes. noor 1 itself has a generating capacity of 160mw.moroccoõs environment minister, hakima el-haite, believes that solar energy could have the same impact on the region this century that oil production had in the last. but the $9bn project to make her countryõs deserts boom was triggered by more immediate concerns, she said.òwe are not an oil producer. we import 94% of our energy as fossil fuels from abroad and that has big consequences for our state budget,ó el-haite told the guardian. òwe also used to subsidize fossil fuels, which have a heavy cost, so when we heard about the potential of solar energy, we thought, ôwhy not?õósolar energy will make up a third of moroccoõs renewable energy supply by 2020, with wind and hydro taking the same share each.òwe are very proud of this project,ó el-haite said. òi think it is the most important solar plant in the world.óeach parabolic mirror is 12 metres high and focused on a steel pipeline carrying a ôheat transfer solutionõ (htf) that is warmed to 393c as it snakes along the trough before coiling into a heat engine. there, it is mixed with water to create steam that turns energy- generating turbines.the htf is made up of a synthetic thermal oil solution that is pumped towards a heat tank containing molten sands that can store heat energy for three hours, allowing the plant to power homes into the night. the mirrors are spaced in tier formations to minimize damage from sand blown up by desert winds.technicians say that the noor 2 and 3 plants, due to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours ð opening the prospect of 24/7 solar energy in the sahara and the surrounding region.òthe biggest challenge we faced was being able to  nish the project on time with the performance level we needed to achieve,ó said rashid al-bayad, the project director.but, even as the  rst phase of the project nears completion, morocco is eyeing grander international ambitions. we are already involved in high tension transportation lines to cover the full south of morocco and mauritania as a  rst step, says ahmed baroudi, manager of societe dinvestissements energetiques, the national renewable energy investment  rm. but he says the projects ultimate impact will go far wider  even as far as the middle east. the ultimate objective given by his majesty the king is mecca."" whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the moroccan solar energy agency (masen). talks are ongoing with tunisia and energy exports northwards across the mediterranean remain a key goal.òwe believe that itõs possible to export energy to europe but,  rst, we would have to build the interconnectors which donõt yet exist,ó said maha el-kadiri, a masen spokeswoman. òspeci cally, we would have to build interconnections, which would not go through the existing one in spain, and, then, start exporting.óspain has itself prohibited new solar projects because of a lack of interconnectors to transmit the energy to france. the eu has set a target of ensuring that 10% of each member countryõs power can be transported abroad by cable by 2020.in the meantime, morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs for resource independence. this could, one day, include water desalination, in a country that is increasingly being hit by drought as the climate warms. of cials are keenly aware of the running they are making in what is the most advanced renewable energy programme in the middle east and north african region.òwe are at the avante-garde of solar,ó el-kadiri says.about $9bn has been invested in the noor complex, much of it from international institutions such as the european investment bank and world bank and backed by moroccan government guarantees. undisclosed energy subsidies from moroccoõs unelected ruler, king mohammed vi, have prevented the cost from being transferred to energy consumers.one month before launch, over a thousand, mostly moroccan, workers are still racing to  x electric wires, take down scaffolding and wrap rockwool insulation around steel pipelines. they bustle past in yellow and orange bibs, working 12-hour shifts against a backdrop of the atlas mountains. harnesses with hammers and gloves strapped to their belts swing by their sides. ubiquitous hard hats, safety shoes and ear plugs give the scene an air of theatrical camp.for hajar lakhael, a 25-year-old environment and security manager from meknes, rehearsals are almost over and the blockbuster production is nearly ready for action.òweõve done the construction and, now, we will see how these projects look when they start,ó she says. òit is exactly like the preparation for a grand performance.óa global audience will be watching with interest."
