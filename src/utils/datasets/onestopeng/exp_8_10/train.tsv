intermediate	you can see a thick layer of bird droppings inside one of britain’s most expensive properties. pigeon skeletons lie among shattered mirrors and water streams through broken walls. this is the tower, a £30m palace in “billionaires’ row” in north london, whose spectacular ruin has been kept secret until now.it is one of ten mansions in the middle of the bishops avenue that have stood almost completely vacant since they were bought a quarter of a century ago, it is believed for members of the saudi arabian royal family. their grecian columns are cracking into pieces and mosaic-tiled swimming pools are filled with rubble. nature has taken over and owls have moved in.it is a sad scene repeated up and down the avenue that lloyds bank has calculated is the second most expensive street in britain. while more and more people struggle to get on to london’s property ladder as house prices rise at 11.2% a year, 16 mansions on the most expensive part of the bishops avenue are empty, many behind locked gates, their overgrown grounds guarded by dogs.across the street stands another derelict mansion, worth £18m, with smashed windows and walls painted with anti-climb paint. metal grilles block the windows of another, which has been sold for £20m.the sight of the derelict properties can be agonizing for people who are struggling to keep a roof above their heads in one of the world’s most expensive cities. one security guard who works on the avenue said it was exasperating to see so many properties – enough to house dozens of people – falling apart.oil-rich royals from nigeria and saudi arabia were among the first to come to this road near hampstead heath. iranians fled here after the fall of the shah. now, chinese house hunters are following russians and kazakhs who have spent millions to get an address that estate agents tell them is as world famous as the champs elysées and rodeo drive. recently, two mansions have been on sale for £65m and £38m, promising endless italian marble, leather-padded lifts and luxury panic rooms.however, in the gardens of the empty mansions, stone fountains crumble. inside one mansion, water drips through a huge crystal chandelier onto a thick carpet rotting under sections of collapsed ceiling. moss grows through shattered bricks and mirrored tiles are lying on a bathroom floor. the swimming pool is filled with dirty water and has flowers growing through its tiles. the wood in the sauna is coming off the walls.but it is the ruin of the towers, a grand mansion set among acres of trees, that is most dramatic. its huge, high-ceiling halls are occupied by pigeons and its walls have been turned bright green by algae. unopened wooden boxes marked “bullet-proof glass” show the security fears of the previous owners.today, very few people live on the bishops avenue full time. a security guard patrolling the pavement outside one mansion said that the owners were not there. another, outside royal mansion, would not say if anyone was home, while a member of staff at another mansion simply warned the guardian about the guard dogs. magdy adib ishak-hannah, whose personal wealth is £45m, said he was in the minority of permanent residents.“it’s not a neighbourly place, where you can chat over the fence,” he said. “to be honest, i have never seen what my neighbours look like. next door, a saudi princess spent £35m on a new house and i’ve never seen her. there are about three houses that are lived in 24/7 and half of the properties are occupied three to six months a year. the other half, who knows if they come or not?”the multimillion-pound ruins are evidence of a property culture in which the world’s richest people see british property as investments.nevertheless, the talk on the avenue is about building £5m apartments, instead of £50m mansions, in an effort to bring people back.anil varma, a local property developer, has decided to rebuild one of the most valuable sites on the avenue as a collection of 20 apartments with a concierge, maid service, 25-metre pool, spa and cinema.“if you build a big house and try and sell for £30m to £40m, it won’t sell,” he said. “locals won’t buy and so you have to bring in overseas buyers.”but nobody plans to use the avenue’s empty property to help solve the housing crisis. andrew harper, a local conservative politician, laughed when he was asked whether some of the derelict housing could become cheap homes. he said the price of the land is far too high.nannan
intermediate	cathal redmond was swimming off the greek coast and he was sure he had taken some great photos of colourful  sh with his  rst underwater camera. but, when he looked at the results later, the photos were brown and murky. he took the pictures while holding his breath underwater and blamed the limited time he had to set up the shots. all he needed, he thought, was a little more time to photograph the  sh in their natural environment.he decided to invent something to make that little extra time a reality and the result is his invention of the express dive ð a re llable air storage device, which is held in the mouth and lets people swim underwater for two minutes. it bridges the gap between snorkelling, with its limitations, and scuba diving, which gives divers the freedom to breathe underwater but requires heavy and expensive gear. the prototype of the invention looks like a combination of a scuba mouthpiece and a water bottle.òi wanted to enable people to do more. so, rather than just go underwater and spend 30 seconds holding their breath, i wanted people to do a little bit more,ó says redmond, 27. in 2006, the irish designer completed a scuba-diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and observe  sh in their natural environment. less enjoyable, however, was all the equipment he neededòi was very aware of the fact that i had about 50kg of equipment on me and going under the water felt strange when you are used to trying to keep yourself at the surface. it was a very surreal experience,ó he says. òthe real problem is that scuba diving is very limiting. although it allows you to stay underwater for longer, you have to plan your whole day around it. you have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you ð you canõt be walking on the beach and decide you want to go in. planning is a very big part of it.óit was during a  nal-year project for his product design degree that redmond produced the express dive. the device has two main parts. when above the surface, the unit sucks in air through a vent in the mouthpiece. the air is compressed through valves and stored in the tank. the tank has a light that  ashes green when it is full. when air is no longer being taken in, the vent shuts off and, as the person dives, air is fed back via the mouthpiece.the light turns from green to red when the air start to run out. the device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to re ll. òwhen you put the compressor into the unit with all of the rest of the stuff, the batteries and the electronics, the dif cult thing was to make it small enough so that people could hold it in their mouths,ó redmond says.redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to using a snorkel. he compares it to an extension of the lungs in that the user is taking a deep breath and then using it underwater. òit is an extension of the bodyõs ability to store air,ó he says. the prototype has been tested in parts. redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutesõ worth of air into the unit and that the design can be held in the diverõs mouth.what he has not yet done is test the device on a diver, fully submerged for two minutes. but, with enough testing, redmond is con dent he can get a fully working device that will not endanger swimmers underwater. the device will probably cost £280, he says, and it is likely to weigh from 1kg to 3kg depending on the safety features needed.to anyone who thinks two minutes of air is no more than a very small improvement on snorkelling, redmond says it could make a big difference underwater. the typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater, he says. òtwo minutes is not a lot of time but it is a lot longer than that,ó he says.nan
intermediate	in iceland, you can be called aagot, arney or ásfríður; baldey, bebba or brá. dögg, dimmblá, etna and eybjört are fine and so are frigg, glódís, hörn and ingunn. jórlaug is ok, as are obba, sigurfljóð, úranía and vagna. but you cannot, as a girl in iceland, be called harriet.“the whole situation,” said tristan cardew, “is really rather silly.” with his icelandic wife, kristin, cardew is appealing against a decision by the national registry in the capital reykjavik not to renew their ten-year-old daughter harriet’s passport because it does not recognize her first name.since the registry does not recognize the name of harriet’s 12-year-old brother duncan either, the two children have, until now, travelled on passports identifying them as stúlka and drengur cardew: girl and boy cardew. “but, this time, the authorities have decided to apply the letter of the law,” cardew, a british-born cook who moved to iceland in 2000, said. “and that says no official document will be issued to people who do not bear an approved icelandic name.”the situation meant the family, from kópavogur, risked missing their holiday in france until they applied to the british embassy for an emergency uk passport, which should now allow them to leave.names are important in iceland, a country of only 320,000 people, whose phone book lists subscribers by their first name for the very sensible reason that most icelandic surnames simply record the fact that you are your father’s (or mother’s) son or daughter. jón einarsson’s children, for example, might be ólafur jónsson and sigríður jónsdóttir.the law says that the names of children born in iceland must – unless both parents are foreign – be submitted to the national registry within six months of birth. if they are not on a recognized list of 1,853 female and 1,712 male names, the parents must seek the approval of a body called the icelandic naming committee.for the 5,000 or so children born in iceland each year, the committee reportedly receives about 100 applications and rejects about half under a 1996 law aimed mainly at preserving the icelandic language. among its requirements are that given names must be “capable of having icelandic grammatical endings”, may not “conflict with the linguistic structure of iceland” and should be “written in accordance with the ordinary rules of icelandic spelling”.what this means in practice is that names containing letters that do not officially exist in iceland’s 32-letter alphabet, such as “c”, are out. similarly, names unable to accommodate the endings required by the different cases used in icelandic are also routinely turned down. “that was the problem with harriet,” said cardew.the country’s naming laws have been criticized in recent years: in 2013, blær – “light breeze” – bjarkardóttir rúnarsdottir won the right to be officially known by her given name, as opposed to “girl”, when a court ruled that denying her was a violation of the icelandic constitution. the former mayor of reykjavik, jón gnarr, has also called iceland’s naming law “unfair, stupid and against creativity”.the cardews could get round harriet’s problem by giving her an icelandic middle name. “but it’s a bit late for that and way too silly,” said cardew. “are they saying they don’t want us here?”
intermediate	in typical bad-boyfriend style, dan sullivan was late to breakfast with the guardian because he got pulled over on his motorcycle.sullivan works too much, he says. he misses dinner dates. he forgets to give presents.and so, like many others in silicon valley, the 27-year-old venture capitalist has come up with a start-up: betterboyfriend.me, a service that sends girlfriends and wives a present every month for about $70.sullivan, who works in finance, has been testing the service and has signed up about 350 boyfriends. most members, he says, are his friends from harvard and other friends who are either venture capitalists, founders of start-ups or employees of companies like apple, google and facebook. the girlfriends of these friends have been getting presents from sullivan for the last year.each month, sullivan’s members choose from a list of seven possible gifts (chocolate, tea sets, manicures). the package is sent to the boyfriend unbranded and unlabelled.he tests his ideas by buying facebook ads to see what kind of interest they get. betterboyfriend.me took off. “people seemed to like betterboyfriend,” sullivan said.another start-up, called invisibleboyfriend, allows users “to design and build a believable partner who is everything you want and is always available to talk, whenever you want”. the end result is a “boyfriend” who can text with you all day.founder kyle tabor launched it to give users a fake boyfriend to deter unwanted advances but has found people have grown attached to their imaginary partners: “many more users are looking for companionship through conversation rather than external ‘proof’ of a relationship.”for sullivan and tabor, the surprise was the real relationships that they have formed with their customers. sullivan says he has begun to see himself as a sort of relationship consultant for the boyfriends.sullivan admits he’s made mistakes. early on, the packages he sent included receipts that had his name on them, dan sullivan. “one of the boyfriends wrote to me and said, ‘listen, she’s not mad but cynthia found out’.”of all the women betterboyfriend.me deliver packages to, about 50% know about dan sullivan’s involvement in their relationships: “it’s connected with age. i think, after you’ve been married for a while, you don’t keep many secrets.”and over the year, the young founder says he’s got to know the boyfriends really well. they’ve even sent a package to a hospital delivery room. the key, he said, is to remember that his relationship is with the boyfriend.when he first started his company, he attached tags that said betterboyfriend.me to flower bouquets and set off for dolores park in mission district, san francisco.“i looked for couples and gave the bouquet to the girl but the boyfriends didn’t like that. not at all. i understood why. it was cool,” he said. “so i changed my idea and started handing out the bouquets to the boyfriends.”nan
intermediate	why do it? the elite football referees of the future smile when you ask them this question. this season, criticism of referees has increased so much that some former referees have started to complain about standards. that is quite significant because, when you talk to referees, it is obvious that supporting each other through thick and thin is fundamental.so why do they do it? why spend hundreds of hours driving up and down the country? why enforce rules, some of which inevitably upset people? why try to climb the ladder until you get the chance to make decisions on television in front of millions of people who scrutinize you and your ability helped by many different camera angles and slow-motion replays?you might get an answer from the face of lee swabey moments after he blows the final whistle of a 2–1 win for grimsby over woking, a match at level 5 of the english league system. he gets what all referees hope for every time they referee a match. “twenty-two handshakes,” he explains afterwards, proudly. symbolically, a full set of handshakes, plus a “well done” from both managers, represents maximum satisfaction. “the buzz,” as he calls it, of a game that passes smoothly, is something he loves. “i wouldn’t spend so much time away from my family if this didn’t mean the world to me.”swabey is one of a group of referees that is highly regarded by the professional game match officials limited (pgmol). so he knew he was being watched at that match. pgmol’s chief, mike riley, was in attendance, along with his colleague steve dunn, watching every significant move the officials make.a few weeks earlier, riley, dunn and another former referee, peter jones, made their way to another level-5 match to watch another young referee – john brooks. “i hope to have the opportunity to get promoted to the premier league and officiate some of the top games in this country,” brooks says.unfortunately, all the pgmol delegation saw was the way brooks handled the difficult situation of cancelling the match because of a frozen pitch. it is all part of the experience brooks needs to acquire before he is trusted with more important games, the different problems that need dealing with – often, clubs are very reluctant to have a late postponement, particularly when they have to pay all the staff who have come but will not receive any gate money.brooks phoned his coach for advice and made the difficult but correct decision. a little later, the football club secretary arrived with envelopes to pay the officials for their time – the match fee at level 5 is £95 so it is clear that these men do not do it for the money.brooks, like swabey, has clear ambitions to progress. he knows that dealing with disappointments is a big part of that. how does he feel watching football on tv when a referee gets vilified? “erm … not great,” he admits. “i do sometimes wish people understood the time and effort we put in. it is very easy to criticize a decision but we do everything to try to get these decisions right. in certain situations, you are going to be unpopular but, if you are uncomfortable with that, you are probably in the wrong job.”the former referees agree that the backup, education and tools that today’s referees have is very different from what they experienced in their own days. riley, as a young referee, bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all.contrast this with brooks, who has a coach he can call. they consult weekly, discuss how his games have gone, study footage of key decisions and work out how to improve. he also has the support of a sports psychologist, liam slack, for regular guidance and an exercise regime to help him handle the 11km he runs during a game.brooks says psychology is vital in his development. “one of the things we have talked about is forgetting decisions and moving on,” he explains. “there may be a big decision to make in the first 30 seconds of the game. once you have made that, you need to stay focused for the next 89 minutes and not be wondering whether that was correct or worrying about that decision. liam has taught us some techniques for forgetting that decision. working with the sports psychologist is really important for mental toughness.”on the subject of technology, the three former referees are unanimous in their support of it. “we are all in favour of anything that makes the referee’s job better and makes them more effective on the pitch,” says riley. minimizing mistakes is the aim. after all, a bad decision can stick with you for a while. “the rest of your life,” adds jones with a chuckle.nannannan
intermediate	in an attempt to reduce air pollution, europe will become the first part of the world to force car makers to use ‘real-world’ emissions tests. new regulations will introduce the tests to reveal what cars’ emissions are like when driving on roads and in traffic, not in ideal, laboratory-like conditions, which is what happens at the moment.the tests, which have been approved by the european commission, are designed to enforce a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre, a level that only one car in 16 meets. other countries, such as china and korea, which are also considering real-world emissions tests, will be watching what happens closely.pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and particulates are believed to be responsible for at least one quarter of the 29,000 annual pollution-related deaths in the uk alone.the current ‘new european drive cycle’ laboratory test for measuring emissions is a quarter of a century old. technological developments in the car industry mean that the test is no longer good enough. studies have shown that the results of lab techniques to measure car emissions can easily be fixed – car makers fix the results by using techniques such as taping up doors and windows to minimize air resistance, driving on unrealistically smooth roads and testing at very high temperatures.“the commission wants to introduce a new emissions testing procedure that will allow proper assessment of the vehicles in real driving,” said lucia caudet, a commission spokesperson.“one key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 citizens each year is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars, causing much more pollution on the road,” said greg archer, the clean vehicles manager for transport and environment. “the development of a new, real-world driving emission test is an important step forward in tackling urban air pollution. european union (eu) states should now support the commission’s proposals and ignore the whingeing from car makers that the rules are too strict.”according to research by the international council on clean transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg per kilometre standard, with some types of cars 22 times above the recommended limit. only one car out of 16 met the 80mg target. around one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport – mostly diesel – and in cities concentrations can be as high as 64%, according to european environment agency data.campaigners say that the car industry has tried to delay reforms to car test cycles. but industry groups deny this – they argue that a five-year delay is necessary for technical and economic reasons. “real driving emissions (rde) is a totally new regulation that will force significant changes to cars,” said cara mclaughlin, a spokesperson for the european automobile manufacturers association (acea). “however, acea fully accepts that rde will apply to new types of cars from september 2017.”acea sent the european commission their own draft regulation for consideration, after eu representatives finally agreed a regulation to implement the nitrogen oxide limits with strengthened road trials and strict monitoring of exhaust fumes. acea’s draft regulation would have covered fewer pollutants and delayed the regulation’s introduction until 2020. test distances would have been shortened from 1,300m to below 700m, minimum temperatures would have been raised from -7c to -3c and more rural roads would have been used.the acea draft was rejected by the commission. the new regulation will now pass to commissioners for approval before an expected introduction in september. by 2017, the first realworld co2 emissions tests are expected to begin in earnest. the introduction of the eu’s new emission tests will be watched closely around the world.
intermediate	galina zaglumyonova was woken in her flat in central chelyabinsk by an enormous explosion that blew in the balcony windows and shattered pots containing her houseplants. when she jumped out of bed, she could see a huge vapour trail hanging in the morning sky and hear car alarms from the street below.“i didn’t understand what was going on,” said zaglumyonova. “there was a big explosion and then a series of little explosions. my first thought was that it was a plane crash.”what she had actually witnessed was a ten-tonne meteorite that fell to earth in a series of fireballs just after sunrise.officials said almost 1,200 people had been injured, with more than 40 taken to hospital – most as a result of flying glass shattered by the sonic boom created by the meteorite’s fall. there were no reported deaths.the meteorite entered the atmosphere travelling at a speed of at least 33,000mph and broke up into pieces between 18 and 32 miles above the ground, according to a statement from the russian academy of sciences.the event caused panic in chelyabinsk, a city of more than one million people to the south of russia’s ural mountains. a video showed the pieces of meteorite glowing more brightly as they approached the moment of impact. the vapour trail was visible for hundreds of miles around, including in neighbouring kazakhstan.tatyana bets was at work in the reception area of a hospital clinic in the centre of the city when the meteorite hit. “first we noticed the wind, and then the room was filled with a very bright light and we could see a cloud of smoke in the sky,” she said. then, after a few minutes, the explosions came.at least three craters were discovered, according to the ministry of the interior. one crater was more than six metres wide and another piece of the meteorite broke through the thick ice of a nearby lake.in chelyabinsk itself, schools and universities were closed and many other staff told to go home early. about 200 children were among the injured.a steady stream of lightly injured people, most suffering cuts from flying glass, came into the clinic where bets works. she said a nearby building for college students was particularly badly affected and many of the students were brought in. “there were a lot of girls in shock. some were very pale and many of them fainted,” she said.early estimates suggested more than 100,000 square metres of glass had been broken and 3,000 buildings hit. the total cost of the damage in the city was being valued at more than one billion roubles (£20m).the meteorite over chelyabinsk arrived less than a day before asteroid 2012 da14 was expected to pass earth very closely (about 17,510 miles). but experts said the two events were not connected.there were lots of rumours and conspiracy theories, however, in the first few hours after the incident. reports on russian state television and in local media suggested that the meteorite was blown apart by local air defence units at an altitude of more than 15 miles.the ultra-nationalist leader of russia’s liberal democrat party, vladimir zhirinovsky, said it was not a meteorite but military action by the united states. “it’s not a meteorite falling – it’s a test of new american weapons,” zhirinovsky said.some were quick to take advantage. enterprising people were offering pieces of meteorite for sale through internet sites within a few hours of the impact.president vladimir putin and the prime minister, dmitry medvedev, were informed about the incident, and putin called a meeting with the head of the emergency situations ministry. “it’s proof that not only are economies vulnerable but the whole planet,” medvedev said at an economic forum in siberia.nan

intermediate	scientists have connected the brains of two animals and allowed them to share sensory information. it is a major step towards what the researchers call the world’s first “organic computer”.the us team fitted two rats with devices called brain-to-brain interfaces that let the animals collaborate on simple tasks to earn rewards, such as a drink of water. in one important demonstration of the technology, the scientists used the internet to connect the brains of two rats separated by thousands of miles – one in north carolina, usa, and the other in natal, brazil.the researchers were led by miguel nicolelis, a pioneer of devices that allow paralyzed people to control computers and robotic arms with their thoughts. they say their latest work could make it possible for multiple brains to be connected to share information. “these experiments showed that we have established a sophisticated, direct communication connection between brains,” nicolelis said. “basically, we are creating what i call an organic computer.”the scientists first demonstrated that rats can share, and act on, each other’s sensory information by electrically connecting their brains via tiny grids of electrodes that reach the part of the brain that processes movement.the rats were taught to press a lever when a light went on above it. when they did the task correctly, they got a drink of water. to test the animals’ ability to share brain information, they put the rats in two separate compartments. only one compartment had a light above the lever. when the rat pressed the lever, an electronic version of its brain activity was sent directly to the other rat’s brain. in tests, the second rat responded correctly to the imported brain signals and pressed the lever 70% of the time.incredibly, the communication between the rats was two-way. if the receiving rat failed at the task, the first rat did not get the reward of a drink, and appeared to change its behaviour to make the task easier for its partner. in further experiments, the rats collaborated on a task that required them to tell the difference between narrow and wide openings using their whiskers.in the final test, the scientists connected rats on different continents and used the internet to send their brain activity back and forth. “even though the animals were on different continents, they could still communicate,” said miguel pais-vieira, the first author of the study. “this tells us that we could create a workable network of animal brains distributed in many different locations.”nicolelis said the team is now working on ways to connect several animals’ brains at once to solve more complex tasks. “we cannot even predict what might happen when animals begin interacting as part of a ‘brain-net’,” he said. “in theory, you could imagine that a combination of brains could find solutions that individual brains cannot achieve by themselves.”anders sandberg, who studies the ethics of neurotechnologies at oxford university, said the work was “very important” in helping to understand how brains encode information. but the potential future uses of the technology are much wider, said sandberg. “the main reason we are running the planet is that we are amazingly good at communicating and coordinating. without that, although we are very smart animals, we would not dominate the planet.”“i don’t think there’s any risk of supersmart rats from this,” he added. “there’s a big difference between sharing sensory information and being able to plan. i’m not worried about an invasion by smart rats.”very little is known about how people encode thoughts and how they might be sent to another person’s brain – so that will not happen any time soon. and much of what is in our minds is a “draft”, as sandberg calls it, of what we might do. “often, we don’t want to reveal those drafts, because that would be embarrassing and confusing. and we change a lot of those drafts before we act. most of the time i think we’d be very thankful not to be in someone else’s head.”
intermediate	jmw turner, one of britain’s greatest painters, will appear on the new £20 note, after a nationwide vote.it will be the first time an artist has appeared on a british banknote, after the governor of the bank of england, mark carney, asked the public to choose a deceased cultural figure they felt deserved to be on the banknote.turner, who is famous for his dramatic seascapes, beat off competition from 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, film-makers and actors put forward by 30,000 members of the public.the list included alfred hitchcock, alexander mcqueen, derek jarman, laura ashley, william morris and vanessa bell. this list was narrowed down to a final choice of five by a panel of artists, critics and historians.the final five – barbara hepworth, charlie chaplin, josiah wedgwood, william hogarth and turner – were chosen because of their “unquestioned” contribution to both the visual arts and british society, as well as their enduring influence.the announcement of the new banknote was made at the turner contemporary gallery in margate. the announcement was made jointly by carney and the artist tracey emin, who grew up in the town.carney said it had been “so important to get this right and have a proper process that involved the public.” he added that banknotes are not only a practical necessity – they “can be a piece of art in everyone’s pocket”.“the fact that we will have turner on the £20 note shows that the british people are a nation of people who appreciate creativity and appreciate the arts,” said emin.the note will show turner’s 1799 self-portrait, as well as one of his most famous works, the fighting temeraire, the ship that played an important role in nelson’s victory at the battle of trafalgar in 1805.the note will also contain a quote from the artist – “light is therefore colour” – as well as his signature. the signature is from his will, in which he left many of his paintings to the nation.historical figures were first shown on banknotes in 1970. turner joins winston churchill and jane austen as the significant figures who will feature on the new polymer notes – a plastic-type material – churchill on the £5 and austen on the £10 note. the new £20 note will be available by 2020.turner was born in 1775 in london, the son of a barber, and he entered the royal academy schools at the age of 14. in 1786, when he was sent to margate, his love of painting and drawing the north-east kent coast began. he returned to that coast throughout his life and it was where he painted some of his most dramatic oils and watercolours. he described its skies as “the loveliest in all europe”.turner was a very prolific artist – he produced more than 550 oil paintings and 2,000 watercolours in his lifetime. his life was also the subject of a film, in 2014, by mike leigh, with timothy spall as the artist.victoria pomery, the director of turner contemporary, said: “the decision to celebrate jmw turner, one of the greatest technical pioneers in the history of british art, is extraordinary. it has proven that turner is the nation’s favourite artist.”nannannannan
elementary	like a typical bad boyfriend, dan sullivan arrived late to breakfast with the guardian because the police stopped him on his motorcyclesullivan works too much, he says. he misses dinner dates. he forgets to give presents.and so, like many others in silicon valley, the 27-year-old has started a business: betterboyfriend.me, a service that sends girlfriends and wives a present every month for about $70.sullivan is testing the service and has about 350 boyfriends as his clients. most clients, he says, are his friends from university and other friends who are founders of start-ups or work for companies like apple, google and facebook. the girlfriends of these men get presents from sullivan.each month, sullivan’s clients choose from a list of seven possible gifts (chocolate, tea sets, etc). then, sullivan sends the gift to the boyfriend.for sullivan, the surprise was the real relationships that he has formed with his clients. sullivan says he has begun to see himself as a sort of relationship consultant for the boyfriends.sullivan says he’s made mistakes. in the beginning, the gifts he sent included receipts with his name on, dan sullivan. “one of the boyfriends wrote to me and said, ‘she’s not mad but cynthia found out’.”of all the women betterboyfriend.me deliver packages to, about 50% know that sullivan chooses the presents they receive: “it’s connected with age. i think, after you’ve been married for a longer time, you don’t keep many secrets.”and over the year, the young founder says he’s got to know the boyfriends really well. they’ve even sent a package to a hospital delivery room. the key, he said, is to remember that his relationship is with the boyfriend.when he first started his company, he attached tags that said betterboyfriend.me to flower bouquets and went to the mission district in san francisco.“i looked for couples and gave the flowers to the girl but the boyfriends didn’t like that. not at all,” he said. “so i changed my idea and gave the flowers to the boyfriends.”nannannannan
elementary	one day, drones could deliver packages to your home. when will this happen? if you believe amazon, it will be soon. other people are not so sure. they have to invent the right technology but, also, they have to consider public safety. amazon say that they will be ready as soon as the federal aviation authority (faa) introduce rules for using drones. the faa will  nally introduce rules for using unmanned aircraft by june 2016. but the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines arenõt legal yet ð only drones up to 25kg will be legal. and the faa says in the rules they want to introduce that drones will all have to use different radio frequencies that nobody can block or hijack.professor sajiv singh, who works for delivery company nearearth, said that  ying drones is quite simple ð you just give it some basic instructions: go to this height, do this short task, go back home. but even short  ights from a mobile landing place could cause serious problems, he said.òtheyõre not planning to deliver in areas where nobody lives; theyõre planning to deliver from a warehouse to the consumer, which will probably be in a town or city,ó he said. òthe drone will have to see hazards. maybe there will be things that the map doesnõt know about. maybe there will be construction equipment that wasnõt there but is there now. maybe gps signals will be blocked so itõs going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.ó all this can be solved, he said ð but itõs dif cult. one big problem is keeping radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks. òif a drone loses radio contact, it will keep going and crash into the ground,ó said robot expert daniel huber.òwe already have most of the technology we need,ó said huber. he is working on a program that will use drones to check telephone lines, bridges and so on. òwe can make drones  y around a certain area and look at every surface.óhuber said about amazon: òthey say that many packages are light ð a drone can carry a kilogram for 15 minutes. if you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood, it can deliver from that vehicle. you need a 15-minute distance, and typical drones have about that distance.ó itõs one way, he said, to make sure people are safe. òthe larger the distance, the more dangerous it becomes.óof course, safety is still a big worry ð singh points out that for a passenger aeroplane to be allowed to  y, it can only have one serious failure every one million hours. drones, he said, are much less safe. òthe reaper drone, for example, has one failure in 10,000 hours,ó singh said.part of the reason for this is simply that air travel is dangerous so standards are much higher. òif you  y a passenger aeroplane, often they will say, ôoh, a small part isnõt working; we have to go back,õó singh said. òand people have been  ying passanger aeroplanes for 60 years! i hate to think that a drone might come down on a busy road.ó part of the solution, singh said, is planning for every situation: òif things fail, the drone has to do something sensible.ónannannan
elementary	more than 100,000 people went onto the streets in brazil to show their anger at violent police, poor public services and high costs for the world cup.the demonstrations in rio de janeiro, são paulo, brasilia, belem, belo horizonte and salvador started peacefully, but there were some clashes with police and people set fire to cars and buses.people complained that police used rubber bullets, tear gas and violent beatings.happening at the start of the football confederations cup, the rallies brought together people who are angry with the high costs and poor quality of public services, the large amounts of money spent on international sporting events, low standards of health care, inequality and corruption.most of the demonstrations were peaceful, but several police were hurt, at least one car was burned and windows were broken.people were demonstrating for different reasons. “we are here because we hate the government. they do nothing for us,” said oscar josé santos, 19 years old.“i’m an architect but i have been unemployed for six months. there must be something wrong with this country,” said nadia al husin.at a smaller rally in brasilia, demonstrators entered the high-security area of the national congress. several climbed onto the roof.in belo horizonte, police clashed with protesters who tried to get into a football stadium, where there was a confederations cup match between nigeria and tahiti.in porto alegre, demonstrators set fire to a bus and, in curitiba, protesters tried to enter the office of the state governor. there were also rallies in belem, salvador and other places.in são paulo, there were large groups of people but the marches were peaceful.most protesters were young and, for many, it was their first experience of such a giant rally. “my generation has never experienced this,” said thiago firbida, a student. “since the dictatorship, brazilians have never demonstrated like this. they did not believe they had a reason to. but now brazil once again has problems, with a constant rise in prices, so people are finally reacting.”brazil’s demonstrations have been given special names – the “vinegar revolution” (because police arrested people for carrying vinegar to stop the effects of tear gas), the “20-cent revolution” (because of the bus price rise) and the passe livre (because of the demand for free public transport).some said the protests did not feel brazilian but they were liberating. “our politicians need to see the strength we have as one people. brazilians are usually too nice; they enjoy partying, not protesting, but something is changing,” said deli borsari, a 53-year-old yoga teacher.after people heard about the costs of new and improved stadiums on the news, the confederations cup football tournament has been one of the reasons for the protests. before saturday’s match in brasilia, groups of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police. frightened japanese supporters ran from the area holding their children, when they heard shots – perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas.another protest march, near rio’s maracana stadium, also had a heavy police response.president dilma rousseff “believes peaceful protests are correct and proper for a democracy and that it is natural for young people to demonstrate.”but people booed the president at the opening ceremony for the confederations cup. she will have serious political problems, both now and in 2014, when brazil will host the world cup and also have an election.nannannannan
elementary	how long can you hold your breath? iõm trying it right now. the  rst 30 seconds are easy. i want to give up at 45 seconds but i continue and it gets easier for a while. but, as i go past one minute, my heart is pounding. i breathe out a tiny bit and this helps. one minute and 12 seconds. iõm quite impressed with myself.in some sports, it is very important to be able to hold your breath, particularly in freediving. in 2006, i met sam amps, who was captain of the uk freedive team. at a swimming pool in bristol, she taught me some simple ways to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater. by the end of the session, i could hold my breath for 90 seconds, long enough to let me swim across the pool. sam swam across the pool three times easily. she could hold her breath for  ve minutes, while swimming. five minutes!i asked how she did it: very slow breathing for several minutes before each dive, then a big, deep breath before diving in.our heart rate doesnõt slow down when we hold our breath. at least, it doesnõt if youõre doing it on land. when youõre under cold water, the heart rate slows down in most people. this change in our bodies is useful in diving ð but it is even more useful for not drowning. holding our breath is becoming very useful in one particular area of medicine. radiotherapy for breast cancer involves pointing radiation exactly at the tumour. itõs usually done in short periods, between breaths. but, if the patient can hold their breath for several minutes, it means that doctors can give the complete radiation dose, in the right place, all at the same time. the problem, of course, is that most people cannot hold their breath for several minutes. but doctors at university hospital birmingham have shown that, if patients are given air with extra oxygen before holding their breath, they can hold it for  ve-and-a-half minutes.surprisingly, to achieve this you have to fool the diaphragm. when you breathe in, youõre pulling the muscle of your diaphragm  at so that the volume of your chest increases ð this pulls the air into your lungs. when you hold your breath, you keep your diaphragm like that. if you breathe extra oxygen before a breath-hold, as in the birmingham radiotherapy experiments, you may be able to stop the diaphragm from becoming tired too quickly. so, itõs your diaphragm, the main muscle of breathing, that is in charge when you are holding your breath. but, in the end, even if youõve fooled it for a while, the signals from the diaphragm become too strong and you have to give up ð and take a breath.nan
elementary	coal will probably rival oil as the world’s biggest source of energy in the next five years. this might be a disaster for the climate.one of the biggest reasons behind the rise in coal use is the big increase in the use of shale gas in the us.new research from the international energy agency (iea) shows that all over the world people are using more coal, except in the us, where shale gas is now more popular than coal. because the us is using less coal, coal prices across the world have reduced. this has made coal more attractive, even in europe.maria van der hoeven, executive director of the iea, said that the amount of coal we use “continues to grow each year and, if no changes are made, coal will catch oil within ten years.”coal is available in large amounts and it can be found in most regions of the world, unlike oil and gas, and it is cheap to extract. the iea says that china and india will drive world coal use in the next five years, and india will probably overtake the us as the world’s second biggest consumer. china is the biggest coal importer, and indonesia is the biggest coal exporter.according to the iea’s medium-term coal market report, the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today.with the highest carbon emissions, coal makes climate change a lot worse, especially when it is burned in old-fashioned, inefficient power stations. coal can also produce sulphur emissions – these lead to acid rain – and mercury and soot-particle pollution.van der hoeven says that we should make coal more expensive so that people prefer to use cleaner technologies such as renewable power. providing cheaper gas is the only way to reduce demand for coal. this has happened in the us because of the big increase in the production of shale gas there in the past five years.she said: “the us experience suggests that a more efficient gas market can reduce coal use, carbon dioxide emissions and electricity bills. europe, china and other regions should take note.”if something isn’t done soon there will be more climate change.nannan
elementary	it is difficult to know exactly where the noise is coming from, but you can hear it everywhere in damascus. all day and all night you can hear the sound of guns, rockets or planes attacking rebels – the sound of war is getting closer to syria’s capital. the syrian war began two years ago and now the people of damascus try not to listen to the sound of explosions just a few miles away.“actually you get used to it after a while,” said george, who lives in the city. “but you never know exactly what they are hitting.” that usually becomes clear later from videos that the opposition puts on youtube.the constant noise of bombs is more worrying because the government tries so hard to pretend that life is normal. “as you can see, everything here is fine but we have to hit the terrorists, these extremists,” an army officer said. one government official said: “if i was afraid, i would just shut my door and stay inside. i have to work and i am not afraid. if i don’t defend my country, who will?”in private conversation, ordinary people say something different. in the centre of town, a shopkeeper complained sadly that his baby daughter cries at the sound of explosions. zeina, a student, worries that she has learnt to live with suffering and danger. “in the beginning, when there started to be explosions, i used to have nightmares,” she said. “now i can sleep through anything.”and, the dangers are increasing even closer to home. sabaa bahrat square was the safest part of damascus, but recently a car bomb exploded there and damaged the syrian central bank. the square is often used for pro-government rallies, with people shouting slogans under enormous pictures of president bashar al-assad.that bombing was not the worst one in damascus in recent months. in february, reports say that 80 people, including schoolchildren, died near the ruling ba’ath party headquarters in mazraa. you can still see the crater. “i live nearby but luckily i wasn’t there,” says munir, a university lecturer.rebels, who are now very close to the city, have recently started to fire mortar bombs. the bombs killed 15 students in a university cafeteria on 28 march. they probably wanted to hit a government building.in july 2012, a bomb killed four of assad’s senior aides. after that, security increased. concrete barriers – often painted in the syrian flag’s black, red and white – now protect official buildings, not just the military or defence installations that are obvious targets.moving around the city has become difficult and takes a lot of time – another part of life today in a nervous city. checkpoints on main roads stop traffic for id checks and bags are searched for explosives. only drivers with official permission can use special fast lanes to avoid the wait.there is one question on everyone’s mind: will there be a battle for damascus – one of the world’s oldest cities – like the one that has badly damaged aleppo? one view is that there will be a battle for syria’s capital, but not yet – in the summer perhaps. others argue that there will probably not be a complete victory for either side and hope for a political solution that comes from abroad. but most people here do not expect things to get better.nannannan
elementary	the brand and logo of apple are the most valuable in the world. they are worth nearly $119 billion – that is more than the economies of morocco, ecuador or oman.the brand value of apple, the world’s biggest company, has increased by 21% in 12 months, the interbrand best global brands report said.people all around the world recognize apple by its simple “apple with a bite missing” logo. other technology companies have also done very well in the 2014 report. the technology companies pushed more traditional brands – such as coca-cola, mcdonald’s and gillette – down the table.google’s brand value rose by 15% to $107 billion to take second place. coca-cola, in third place, is up 3% to $81.5 billion. ibm’s value is $72.2 billion and microsoft’s $45.5 billion. they are in fourth and fifth places.facebook’s value has increased the most in the table. its brand value increased by 86% to $14.3 billion. it is at 29th place in the table, ahead of older global companies such as volkswagen, kellogg’s and ford.apple was started by steve jobs in his los altos garage in 1976. it only appeared in the top ten of the interbrand annual study in 2011.its logo was created by advertising executive rob janoff in 1977. it was designed with a bite taken out of it so that it would not look like a cherry.graham hayles, interbrand’s chief marketing officer, said, “apple makes a lot of money because it has a very strong brand. if you have a strong brand, you make more money.”many technology companies rose up the chart but some fell, too. finnish mobile-phone company nokia dropped 41 places to 98th at $4.1 billion, just ahead of nintendo in 100th place (down 33).a chinese company has appeared in the top 100 for the first time, with mobile-phone and broadband company huawei at 94th place. it has a brand value of $4.3 billion.most of the brands in the top 100 are american. the most valuable non-american brands are south korea’s samsung (6th), japan’s toyota (8th) and germany’s mercedes-benz (10th). the most valuable british brands are hsbc (33rd), shell (65th) and burberry (73rd).other fashion brands in the top 100 include boss, prada and ralph lauren. designer label louis vuitton is the top fashion name, in 19th position with a value of $23 billion, just ahead of clothing chain h&m, with a brand value of $21 billion in place 21.sports brand nike is at place 22 with a brand value of nearly $20 billion, ahead of its rival adidas at place 59 with a value of $7 billion.jez frampton, chief executive of interbrand, said that customers now have more control than ever over a brand’s reputation. this is because they can make comments about a brand on social media, such as twitter.“customers expect interaction, 24/7 accessibility, customization options and high levels of personalization,” he said.nannannan
elementary	i got a degree in spanish and this helped me get my fi rst job as a journalist, with an international press agency in mexico city. but, the degree didn’t stop me from making mistakes.i arrived in the mexican capital after a bus journey all the way from new york. in my new job, i spent my days on the streets in political rallies and my nights alone in the offi ce, where i coordinated the news from areas of fi ghting in el salvador, nicaragua, guatemala and the rest of central america. but, i also had to report on disasters: fi res, fl oods and explosions at fi rework factories.while i was working as a reporter, i found out that i was bad at understanding numbers in spanish. once, when i wanted to phone the police, i got a mexican grandmother out of bed at 2am because i had misunderstood a phone number. even worse, there were too many victims in my stories – 83 dead in a fi re at 6pm become 38 dead by 7pm; 12 people injured in a coach crash soon became two and so it went on. finally, i got a call from the main offi ce in washington. “i don’t know what training you have had,” an editor shouted, “but has no one ever told you a death toll can’t go down?!”why are numbers in another language such a problem? perhaps it is because of different numbering systems. in german, for example, 2.30pm is halb drei (half of three) and 21 is einundzwanzig (one and twenty). different number systems can clearly cause confusion.some experts believe there is a link between dyscalculia – the diffi culty in understanding arithmetic – and problems learning foreign languages, particularly if you learn languages by rote. but, some students who fi nd it hard to learn languages with a grammar textbook may learn more easily in a foreign country, where learning is more natural. in my case, i have always found languages quite easy, apart from the numbers.but, perhaps it’s also because we often hear numbers in a non-native language out of context. you may stop listening to the foreign language and suddenly be unable to understand. i talked to multilingual friends and they said that they are fl uent in french or italian when ordering from a restaurant menu, for example, but freeze if they have to say numbers, especially over the phone. numbers seem to be diffi cult, but no one could say why.in my case, my problems with numbers in a foreign language followed me from mexico to other countries and from spanish to german and portuguese. but, in that fi rst journalism job, getting the numbers wrong didn’t always mean failure.one night, a mexican colleague told me that a gunman was holding the american consul hostage in his offi ce in the port city of veracruz. there was no senior english-speaking reporter in the offi ce, so they asked me to try to call the consulate. i got the phone number wrong and i was put through to another phone somewhere else in the building. i knew straight away who the person was: i talked for 15 minutes to the gunman. he didn’t put away his gun as a result of his conversation with me – but my reputation as a reporter rose instantly.
elementary	an international agreement to improve safety in bangladesh’s clothes factories could face legal action. this is because factory owners are asking for compensation for the cost of closures and repair work. some repairs may take months and factory owners say they cannot pay workers while factories are closed. also, they cannot pay for big works to make buildings safe. the building repairs are happening after the rana plaza building in the capital of bangladesh, dhaka, collapsed in 2013 and 1,138 people died.the problems come as hundreds of bangladeshi clothes factories are inspected every month for fire-safety and structural problems under the accord on fire and building safety in bangladesh. the accord is supported by over 170 international companies, including primark and marks & spencer, and international trade unions, including industriall.the owner of one dhaka factory, softex cotton, said he will take legal action against the accord because his factory was closed down as a result of structural problems. he wants around $100 million in compensation.another factory owner said that, when a factory closed, even for a few months, it would lose orders and close permanently: “there is no such thing as temporary closure,” he said. the factory owner said it was not clear in the accord agreement who would pay for factory closures.jenny holdcroft, policy director for industriall, which has been closely involved in the accord, said that the agreement made sure that factories would not lose orders during closure because companies agreed to continue orders with suppliers for two years.the accord has found12 factories that need a lot of work, but holdcroft said many of those only needed partial closure and production could continue on other floors. the accord also asks companies to make sure that workers receive pay during factory closures. she said that factory owners who could afford to pay for repairs and compensation for workers should make the payments.“companies don’t want to pay so that rich factory owners can continue to just take the profits and not spend on their factories for years. it is not surprising that there is disruption. if there was no disruption, there would be no change,” she said. a spokesman for the accord said negotiations over payments and even legal action would not delay its work to improve safety in factories.but there is now more pressure on the accord to help pay workers when their factories close. a rival factory-safety group, supported by us retailers including walmart and gap, the alliance for bangladesh worker safety, has given $5 million to help pay factory workers for up to two months while buildings are improved.“the alliance is sharing the workers’ salary with factory owners so now there is a big confusion. we had a big meeting with the accord to make them understand they have to help or how will we help our workers?” said shaidullah azim, a director of the bangladeshi garment manufacturers and exporters association.
elementary	scarlett johansson is suing a french novelist for û50,000. she says that he wrote things about her personal life that are not true.la premiere chose quon regarde (the first thing we look at) by gregoire delacourt is the story of a french model who looks so similar to the american actor that the books main male character thinks she is johansson. in the novel, the models beauty means that men see her only as a sex object and women are jealous of her. she has many adventures as johansson and, in the end, dies in a car crash.johansson does not feel  attered by the best- seller. her lawyer, vincent toledano, told le figaro that delacourtõs novel illegally used ms johanssonõs name. he has now gone to court because johansson does not want the book to be translated or to become a  lm.delacourt said that he chose to mention johansson because she is famous for her beauty. he said: òi wrote a work of  ction. my character is not scarlett johansson.óon french radio, the author recently said the legal action was òsad.ódelacourt is one of franceõs best-loved authors; his last novel, my list of desires, was translated into 47 languages and they are making a  lm of it. but he said he was òspeechlessó when he found out johansson was suing him.òi thought she would ask me to go for a coffee with her. i didnõt write a novel about a celebrity,ó he said. òi wrote a real love story about womenõs beauty, especially interior beauty.òif an author can no longer write about the things that surround us ð a brand of beer, a monument, an actor ð itõs going to be dif cult to write  ction.òiõm not sure sheõs read the novel because it hasnõt been translated yet.óemmanuelle allibert, spokeswoman for publisher jc latte_s, said taking legal action was òcrazyó. òwe have never known anything like it. it is very surprising because the novel is not even about scarlett johansson. it is about a woman who is scarlett johanssonõs double.óthe authorõs legal situation would be easier if he had published the book in the usa and not in france. lloyd jassin, a new york lawyer, said that the case would probably not go to court in the united states.òi thought she might send me  owers because the book was a declaration of love for her, but she didnõt understand,ó delacourt said.nannannan
advanced	crunchy, full of protein and to be found under a rock near you. insects have long been overlooked as food in all but a handful of places around the world – but now they are crawling closer and closer to our plates. spring 2013 will see a drive towards removing the yuck factor and putting insects not just on experimental gastronomic menus but also on supermarket shelves.in april, there will be a festival in london, pestival 2013 – a wellcome trust-backed insect appreciation event where the consumption of creepy-crawlies comes high on the agenda. it will feature a two-day “pop-up” restaurant by the nordic food lab, the scandinavian team behind the danish restaurant noma, which brought ants to the table for a sellout ten-day run at claridge’s hotel in mayfair in 2012.noma has been named the world’s best restaurant by restaurant magazine for three years running. its chef, rené redzepi, says that ants taste like lemon, and a purée of fermented grasshoppers and moth larvae tastes like a strong fish sauce. bee larvae make a sweet mayonnaise used in place of eggs and scientists are constantly coming up with new ways to use little creatures.in march, a bbc documentary will feature food writer stefan gates searching out and eating deep-fried locusts and barbecued tarantulas. but, behind all the gimmicks and jokes about flies in the soup there is a deeply serious message. many experts believe there is a clear environmental benefit to humans eating creepy-crawlies.the un’s food and agriculture organization (fao) has been funding projects since 2011 aimed at promoting the eating and farming of insects in south-east asia and africa, where an estimated two billion people already eat insects and caterpillar larvae as a regular part of their diet. in 2012, the fao published a list of 1,909 edible species of insect and, with sponsorship from the dutch government, plans a major international conference on “this valuable food source” in 2013.insects are plentiful – globally, for every human there are 40 tonnes of insects – so there is not too much chance of them being endangered, and they are unlikely to have been dosed with chemicals. “i know it’s taboo to eat bugs in the western world, but why not?”, redzepi has said. “you go to south-east asia and this is a common thing. you read about it from all over the world, that people are eating bugs. if you like mushrooms, you’ve eaten so many worms you cannot imagine. but also we eat honey, and honey is the vomit of a bee. think of that next time you pour it into your tea.”he said that the basic premise behind nordic food lab was: “nothing is not edible.”insects are critical to life on earth and, with more than a million species, are the most diverse group of creatures on the planet, yet they are misunderstood, hated and often put to death by humans just because they are there.over the next 30 years, the planet’s human population will increase to nine billion. already one billion people do not get enough food. the increase will mean more pressure on agricultural land, water, forests, fisheries and biodiversity resources, as well as nutrients and energy supplies.the cost of meat is rising, not just in terms of hard cash but also in terms of the amount of rainforest that is destroyed for grazing or to grow feedstuff for cattle. there is also the issue of methane excreted by cows. the livestock farming contribution, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, is enormous – 35% of the planet’s methane, 65% of its nitrous oxide and 9% of the carbon dioxide.edible insects emit fewer gases, contain high-quality protein, vitamins and amino acids, and have a high food-conversion rate, needing a quarter of the food intake of sheep, and half of pigs and chickens, to produce the same amount of protein. they emit fewer greenhouse gases and less ammonia than cows and can be grown on organic waste. china is already successfully setting up huge maggot farms. zimbabwe has a thriving mapone caterpillar industry and laos was given nearly $500,000 by the fao to develop an insect-harvesting project. it’s already big business in the uk, though not always official: a man was recently detained by gatwick customs as he stepped off a flight from burkina faso with 94 kilos of mapone, worth nearly £40,000, in his luggage.a study by foodservicewarehouse.com suggested that swapping pork and beef for crickets and locusts could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 95%. but perhaps the fairest thing about eating worms and insects comes when we are dead – then they get a chance to nibble their own back.
advanced	on one day in august, one in seven people on earth, 1 billion people, used facebook, according to founder mark zuckerberg. in a decade, the social network has transformed peopleõs relationships, privacy, their businesses, news media, helped topple regimes and even changed the meanings of everyday words.òa more open and connected world is a better world. it brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society that re ects all of our values,ó wrote zuckerberg in the post announcing the numbers.these are just some of the ways his company changed everything ð for better or worse.1 facebook has changed the de nition of òfriendó òto friendó is now a verb. and, unlike in real life, when the ending of a friendship can be deeply traumatic, it is easy to òunfriendó, a word invented to describe ditching a casual acquaintance when they are no longer enhancing your facebook newsfeed.although the meanings of the words òshareó and òlikeó are essentially the same, facebook has brought an entirely new weight to the terms.school and university reunions have become redundant ð you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and youõve seen endless pictures of your schoolmatesõ babies. you wonõt be surprised by an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyõre dating someone else from the romantic sel es.but, unlike in real life, facebook has no hierarchy of friendships. a classmate from one project at university who you havenõt seen in 15 years, a friend-of-a-friend from a stag do or a colleague youõve never actually spoken to in person ð they are all facebook friends in the same way as your closest mate or your spouse or your mum.it doesnõt necessarily mean we see them the same way. professor robin dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have roughly 150 people as a social group. facebook hasnõt changed that yet, he believes, but, in an interview with the new yorker, dunbar said he feared it was so easy simply to end friendships on facebook that, eventually, there may no longer be any need to learn to get along.2 we care less about privacy thereõs a wise saying: if youõre not paying for it, youõre the product. facebook embodies that philosophy and created an entire industry from it. the astonishing thing is that users know that and they willingly hand over that information.pew research center found that most young people are more than willing to hand over their details. an overwhelming majority of 91% post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, up from 61%, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.but, as so much of a personõs life is shared online, facebook gives a platform for everyone to cultivate an image and a fanbase. in an article for the journal frontiers in psychology, academics described a new phenomenon, the emergence of the òfacebook selfó.more than 80% list their interests, allowing brands to target them most effectively. but most younger users do restrict their pro les, with 60% allowing friends only.3 facebook has created millions of jobs ð but not in its own of ces facebook has essentially created an entire sector, including indirect employment for people whose job it is to make the platform work for their brand.òit is a tool like no other,ó said michael tinmouth, a social media strategist who has worked with brands such as vodafone and microsoft. òmarketers have an understanding of a brandõs consumers like they have never had before. the data and analytics available to you are extraordinary. you know who your customers are, who they are friends with and how they engage with your brand.óand advertisers pay a lot for that. facebook reported ad revenue was up 46%, reaching $3.32bn.facebook is also a mine eld for brands. suddenly, rather than complaint conversations taking place over the phone with a customer service representative or on a small specialist internet forum, angry customers can post their complaints for hundreds of their friends to see or even on the page where all loyal fans of the brand have been carefully cultivated. and an injustice can go viral.4 facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions though the arab spring was dubbed the twitter revolution, organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by facebook. manchester universityõs olga onuch found facebook had been the key medium for reaching half of all the euromaidan protesters in ukraine.facebook posts signalled the start of the maidan protests during the hours after it was announced that ukraine would not sign a free trade and association agreement with the eu, onuch found. the posts organized live action, not just online anger. mustafa nayyem, the ukraine activist, posted: òif you really want to do something, donõt just ôlikeõ this post. letõs meet near the monument to independence in the middle of the maidan.ómany of those interviewed in onuchõs research said they relied on facebook for the truth about what was happening ð unable to trust traditional media.5 facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news roughly 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63% of users overall, according to the pew research center. about a third of facebook users post about politics and government.most people will  rst encounter a piece of journalism or an item of breaking news via facebook or other social media, and most of those encounters will be on mobiles.users might never have to leave the site to get their news: instant articles will see stories run within facebook. it allows news companies to sell ads around their articles, gaining them 100% of that revenue, while facebook can also sell ads around that article, with 70% of the revenue from the social networkõs advertising also going to the news companies.facebook has also changed the ways journalists write stories. it is a resource many reporters cannot now live without. for better or (often) worse, it is a directory to  nd, contact and glean information for almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly  nd themselves at the centre of the dayõs biggest news story. facebook has its own newswire, sharing the most useful user reaction to breaking stories, including pictures and videos.6 users are changing facebook it used to be a site to get students connected, with only elite us universities allowed access.in 2014, a decade after its launch, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a facebook account. and 39% are connected to people they have never met in person.groups have given way to pages, writing on each others walls is passe and carefully curated albums have given way to instant mobile uploads. more than ever, the site is a gateway not just to your friends but to the rest of the internet.we may as well get used to it, said david kirkpatrick, author of the facebook effect. òit might very well go away further down the road but something this big takes a long time to disappear,ó he told bbc radio 4õs today programme. òfacebook has proven its ability to change and it will continue to be a very, very major player.ó
advanced	swedish prisons have long had a reputation around the world for being progressive. but are the country’s prisons a soft option?the head of sweden’s prison and probation service, nils oberg, announced in november 2013 that four swedish prisons are to be closed due to an “out of the ordinary” decline in prisoner numbers.although there has been no fall in crime rates, between 2011 and 2012 there was a 6% drop in sweden’s prisoner population, now a little over 4,500. a similar decrease is expected in 2013 and 2014. oberg admitted to being puzzled by the unexpected dip, but expressed optimism that the reason was to do with how his prisons are run. “we certainly hope that the efforts we invest in rehabilitation and preventing relapse of crime has had an impact,” he said.“the modern prison service in sweden is very different from when i joined as a young prison officer in 1978,” says kenneth gustafsson, governor of kumla prison, sweden’s most secure jail, situated 130 miles west of stockholm. however, he doesn’t think the system has gone soft. “when i joined, the focus was very much on humanity in prisons. prisoners were treated well – maybe too well, some might say. but, after a number of high-profile escapes in 2004, we had to rebalance and place more emphasis on security.”despite the hardening of attitudes toward prison security following the escape scandals, the swedes still managed to maintain a broadly humane approach to sentencing, even of the most serious offenders: jail terms rarely exceed ten years; those who receive life imprisonment can still apply to the courts after a decade to have the sentence commuted to a fixed term, usually in the region of 18 to 25 years. sweden was the first country in europe to introduce the electronic tagging of convicted criminals and continues to strive to minimize short-term prison sentences wherever possible by using community-based measures, which have been proven to be more effective at reducing reoffending.the overall reoffending rate in sweden stands at between 30 and 40% over three years – to compare that with another european country, the number is around half that of the uk. one likely reason for the relatively low reoffending rate and the low rate of incarceration in sweden (below 70 per 100,000 head of population) is that the age of criminal responsibility is set at 15. in the uk, for example, children aged ten to 17 and young people under the age of 21 record the highest reoffending rates: almost three quarters and two thirds, respectively. a good proportion of these offenders go on to populate adult jails. in sweden, no young person under the age of 21 can be sentenced to life – this is not the case in many other countries – and every effort is made to ensure that as few juvenile offenders as possible end up in prison.one strong reason for the drop in prison numbers might be the amount of post-prison support available in sweden. a confident probation service – a government agency – is tasked not only with supervising those on probation but is also guaranteed to provide treatment programmes for offenders with drug, alcohol or violence issues. the service is assisted by around 4,500 lay supervisors – members of the public who volunteer to befriend and support offenders under supervision.gustafsson talks about broader goals and objectives for the swedish justice department: “in 2013 and 2014, the priority of our work will be with young offenders and men with convictions of violent behaviour. for many years, we have been running programmes to help those addicted to drugs. now, we are also developing programmes to address behaviours such as aggression and violence. these are the important things for our society when these people are released.”i spoke to a former prisoner who now runs a social enterprise called x-cons sweden. peter soderlund served almost three years of a four-year sentence for drug and weapons offences before he was released in 1998. he was helped by a newly formed organization run by former prisoners called kris (criminals’ return into society).“the big difference between kris and us is that we are happy to allow people who are still taking addiction medications to join us,” he says. both organizations work with the same goal: helping prisoners successfully reintegrate into society after they have been released. and what is life like for the prisoner in sweden? “when i was inside, i was lucky. in osteraker prison, where i served my sentence, the governor was enlightened. we were treated well. but i knew that not all swedish prisons were like that. i met so many people in there who needed help – after i received help from kris, i knew i wanted to help others. with x-cons, we meet them at the gate and support them into accommodation and offer a network of support.”“in sweden, we believe very much in the concept of rehabilitation, without being naive of course,” says gustafsson. “there are some people who will not or cannot change. but, in my experience, the majority of prisoners want to change, and we must do what we can to help to facilitate that. it is not always possible to achieve this in one prison sentence.“also, it is not just prison that can rehabilitate – it is often a combined process, involving probation and greater society. we can give education and training, but, when they leave prison, these people need housing and jobs.”
advanced	the senate intelligence committee has approved a bill that would provide for increased transparency of the national security agency’s bulk collection of us phone records but allow the controversial practice to continue. sponsored by chairwoman dianne feinstein, the bill lets the nsa continue to collect phone metadata of millions of americans for renewable 90-day periods and allows the government to retain it. some legislators have alternatively proposed letting phone companies hold the metadata. it passed the committee by an 11-4 vote, paving the way for a full senate vote.the bill allows analysts to search through the data if they suspect there is a ‘reasonable suspicion’ that a suspect is associated with international terrorism. additionally, the bill allows the nsa to continue surveillance begun on foreigners outside the us if they enter the country ‘for a transitory period not to exceed 72 hours’.the bill is a direct challenge to one introduced by senator patrick leahy that would end domestic phone-records collection. it was also opposed by leading intelligence committee member mark udall, who said it did not go far enough. “the nsa’s invasive surveillance of americans’ private information does not respect our constitutional values and needs fundamental reform, not incidental changes. unfortunately, the bill passed by the senate intelligence committee does not go far enough to address the nsa’s overreaching domestic surveillance programmes,” udall said.another democratic member of the committee, ron wyden, said the bill maintains “business as usual” and “remains far from anything that could be considered meaningful reform”. feinstein defended the nsa bulk collection programme, but said there was a need to rebuild public trust. “the nsa call-records programme is legal and subject to extensive congressional and judicial oversight, and i believe it contributes to our national security,” she said in a statement. “but more can, and should, be done to increase transparency and build public support for privacy protections in place.”in her statement, feinstein said the bill would also make a number of improvements to transparency and oversight on the nsa, including: • requiring an annual public report of the total number of queries of nsa’s telephone metadata database and the number of times the programme leads to an fbi investigation or probable cause order; • requiring that the foreign intelligence surveillance court impose limits on the number of people at nsa who may authorize or query the call-records database; • establishing criminal penalties of up to ten years in prison for intentional unauthorized access to data acquired under the foreign intelligence surveillance act (fisa) by the united states; • mandating the fisa court impose a limit on the number of contacts an analyst can receive in response to a query of bulk communication records.after the committee’s hearing had ended, feinstein strongly endorsed the nsa’s main domestic programme. “i think there’s huge misunderstanding about this nsa database programme, and how vital it is to protecting this country,” she told reporters.concern over the intelligence committee’s bill was expressed by independent legal experts, who said the stage was now set for a showdown with the usa freedom act, a bill introduced by leahy and jim sensenbrenner that would prohibit bulk collection of americans’ telephone records. elizabeth goitein of the brennan center for justice said: “the intelligence committee bill and the usa freedom act present two opposing visions of the relationship between law-abiding americans and the national security state. the fundamental question is: should the government have some reason to suspect wrongdoing before sweeping up americans’ most personal information to feed into its databases? leahy and sensenbrenner say yes; feinstein says no.”wyden suggested that recent concern about nsa spying on foreign leaders had distracted from the real focus on mass domestic surveillance in the us. “the statements that american intelligence officials have made about collecting on the intentions of foreign leadership, that’s consistent with the understanding i’ve had for years, as a member of the intelligence committee,” he said. “that has implications for foreign policy. my top priority is ending the mass surveillance, digital surveillance, of millions and millions of lawabiding americans.”feinstein unexpectedly announced that she was “totally opposed” to the foreign leader spying of the sort the nsa conducts of german chancellor angela merkel. feinstein has been a staunch supporter of the nsa’s bulk collection of americans’ phone records.“americans are making it clear, that they never – repeat, never – agreed to give up their constitutional liberties for the appearance of security,” wyden said. “we’re just going to keep fighting this battle. it’s going to be a long one.”separately, feinstein said that james clapper, the director of national intelligence, had agreed to provide her in writing with a statement about a washington post story that alleged the nsa had intercepted data in transmission between google and yahoo data centres. she said she was withholding judgement on the story until she saw clapper’s rebuttal. her strong endorsement of the domestic phone records collection indicates that the powerful senate democrat is not yet prepared to expand the criticism of the nsa that she has launched, “totally opposing” its surveillance of foreign allied leaders – a more traditional intelligence activity than bulk phone metadata surveillance.wyden would not comment on the washington post report on the google and yahoo intercepts. but the senators suggested it had implications for the privacy of americans’ communication. “decades ago, countries had their own kinds of communication systems. now that you’ve had the merger of global communications, i think you’re going to have a lot more challenges spying on foreigners with implications for us citizens,” wyden said.
advanced	bogus allergy tests are convincing thousands of people to take unnecessary treatments and put themselves or their children on inadequate diets, sometimes resulting in malnutrition, a group of experts and charities has said. allergies and food intolerances are soaring but confusion between the two, as well as the many misdiagnoses, are causing real harm, said the information organization sense about science, which has produced a guide in collaboration with allergy specialists and charities.“it’s probably the biggest mess for science communication, where myths, misinterpreted studies and quackery collide with under- and over-diagnosis,” said tracey brown, director of sense about science. “the costs are huge – unnecessary actions for some and not enough action for those whose lives depend on it.”experts fear that restaurants and caterers are seeing so many people claiming they have allergies (which can be dangerous for the individual), when in fact they have a food intolerance (which is not), that they may not take all the precautions they should when serving a person who has a genuine allergy.“it matters very much,” said moira austin of the anaphylaxis campaign. “if a caterer thinks somebody is just avoiding a food because they don’t want to get bloated, they may be less careful. there have been a number of fatalities where people have gone to a restaurant and alerted staff that they have an allergy to a particular food and the meal has been served up containing that allergen.”the guide says most internet and shop-bought allergy tests have no scientific basis. they include a home-testing kit that looks for specific igg (immunoglobulin g) antibodies against food stuffs in the blood. while these antibodies are part of the immune system’s response to infections, “the best medical evidence has shown elevated igg levels do not suggest an allergy”, the guide says. “results are frequently positive in individuals who do not have an allergy or a food intolerance.”also debunked is a test, a mixture of acupuncture and homeopathy, which attempts to measure electronic resistance across the skin while the child or adult holds the suspect food in their hand. hair follicle testing is also pointless, the guide says. “hair is not involved in allergic reactions so testing hair samples cannot provide any useful information on allergic status.” nor should people be deceived into thinking allergies are caused by an “energy blockage” that can be diagnosed by muscle testing and cured by acupuncture.“i commonly see children who’ve been put on to unnecessarily restricted diets because their parents assume, in good faith, that they have allergies to multiple foods on the basis of ‘allergy tests’ that have no scientific basis,” said paul seddon, a consultant paediatric allergist, on behalf of the uk cochrane centre, an independent organization that assesses medical evidence. “this needs to stop, which can only happen if we debunk these ‘tests’.”another consultant paediatric allergist, adam fox from guys and st thomas’ hospital in london, said: “i get a number of patients, and my colleagues likewise, who will come in having sent their hair off for analysis or having excluded a whole range of foods for their children. it is very difficult to untangle that. there are two challenges. children need to be given proper diets but more of it is the unnecessary avoidance of things that aren’t harmful, which has a huge impact on the quality of life. a child who can’t eat wheat or drink milk can’t go to parties.”the conviction that a child’s chronic lethargy or headaches or eczema are caused by an allergy takes a long time and many tests to prove or disprove. it is tempting to go to an alternative therapist who will do a single test and provide a quick, but inaccurate, answer.allergies are on the rise across developed countries. the percentages of children diagnosed with allergic rhinitis and eczema have both trebled in the last 30 years. while there is now better diagnosis, the rise in incidence is real, leading many more people to suspect allergies are the reason for their own or their children’s health issues. the guide lists a number of myths about the sources of allergies, from the suggestion that they are caused by e numbers in food colourings to “toxic overload” and fast food.

advanced	loneliness has finally become a hot topic – the office for national statistics has found britain to be the loneliest country in europe. british people are less likely to have strong friendships or know their neighbours than residents anywhere else in the eu and a relatively high proportion of them have no one to rely on in a crisis. meanwhile, research by professor john cacioppo at the university of chicago has found loneliness to be twice as bad for older people’s health as obesity and almost as great a cause of death as poverty.but, shocking as this is, such studies overlook the loneliness epidemic among younger adults. in 2010, the mental health foundation found loneliness to be a greater concern among young people than the elderly. the 18- to 34-year-olds surveyed were more likely to feel lonely often, to worry about feeling alone and to feel depressed because of loneliness than the over-55s.“loneliness is a recognized problem among the elderly – there are day centres and charities to help them,” says sam challis, an information manager at the mental health charity mind, “but, when young people reach 21, they’re too old for youth services.” this is problematic because of the close relationship between loneliness and mental health – it is linked to increased stress, depression, paranoia, anxiety, addiction, cognitive decline and is a known factor in suicide. in a new essay, paul farmer, the chief executive of mind, and jenny edwards, the chief executive of the mental health foundation, say it can be both a cause and effect of mental health problems.but what can young people do to combat loneliness? dr grant blank, a survey research fellow at the oxford internet institute, points out that social media and the internet can be a boon and a problem. they are beneficial when they enable us to communicate with distant loved ones, but not when they replace face-to-face contact. “people present an idealized version of themselves online and we expect to have social lives like those portrayed in the media,” says challis. comparing friends’ seemingly perfect lives with ours can lead us to withdraw socially.while meditation techniques and apps such as headspace are trendy solutions frequently recommended for a range of mental health problems, they’re not necessarily helpful for loneliness, as they actively encourage us to dwell alone on our thoughts. “you’d be better off addressing the underlying causes of being lonely first – what’s stopping you going out and seeing people?” asks challis.indeed, a study of social media at the university of michigan in 2013 found that, while facebook reduces life satisfaction, using technology to help you meet new people can be beneficial. and, if for whatever reason, you are unable to venture outside, the internet can bring solace. mumsnet has been “an absolute godsend” for maddy matthews, 19, a student with a two-month-old daughter. since the birth, she rarely sees her university friends and her partner works most evenings. “in the first few days, i was up late at night feeding her and i was worried i was doing something wrong. being able to post on mumsnet has helped me feel less alone.”helplines can also reduce loneliness, at least in the short term. one in four men who call the emotional support charity samaritans mention loneliness or isolation and get connected is a free confidential helpline for young people, where they can seek help with emotional and mental health issues often linked to loneliness. there are also support services on websites such as mind’s that can remind you you’re not alone.at work, it can be beneficial to tell your employer how you’re feeling. john binns, who advises businesses on mental health and well-being, was admitted to hospital for stress-related depression in 2007 and took two months off work. he felt as if there was no one to talk to and he wasn’t close enough to colleagues for them to notice the changes in his behaviour. greater openness with his employer and colleagues made his return to work easier. “often people find that colleagues are more supportive than they’d expected. mine started to reach out, asking me to lunch and reassuring me that the world hadn’t moved on that much since i’d left.”office chit-chat may seem like a waste of time, but it helps to cushion us from the emotional and psychological effects of work strain. “if you form connections with your team, you might be stressed but not isolated,” says rick hughes, the british association for counselling and psychotherapy’s (bacp) lead adviser for the workplace.“we treat the networks we have as incidental but they’re fundamental to our well-being,” says nicky forsythe, a psychotherapist and the founder of talk for health, a social enterprise that trains people to give and receive peer support in groups. “the most important thing is to have a regular time and place to reflect on your life and to have an empathetic listener.”for developing personal skills such as empathy, counselling can help. the bacp website allows you to search for counsellors in your area. “a problem aired is a problem shared and sometimes you need to talk to someone impartial and independent of your friends and family,” says hughes. most universities offer students such counselling and many run group sessions that specifically address loneliness.if recent research is to be believed, loneliness is killing the elderly and, with an ageing population, we should aim to reduce our isolation before it is too late. “getting older doesn’t have to mean getting lonelier,” says ruth sutherland, the chief executive of the relationship counselling service relate, in a new report. “but much of this rests on laying the foundations to good-quality relationships earlier in life.”
advanced	it has charted the world’s highest peaks, the ocean floor, the amazon rainforest and even provided a glimpse into north korea. but google’s mission to map the world has largely steered clear of the inhospitable arctic.now, however, the search-engine firm is embarking on what might be the most significant update to centuries of polar cartography – and one it hopes will help provide a better understanding of life on the permafrost for millions of web users. google has flown a small team to iqaluit, the largest town in the canadian territory of nunavut, armed with their warmest winter gear, a stack of laptop computers and an 18kg backpackmounted telescopic camera.helped by an inuit mapping expert, and stalked by curious locals, the team spent four days trudging through the terrain and collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on the tundra of baffin island what urbanites across the globe now take for granted.the town of 7,000 people will go on display via google’s popular street view application in july 2013.aaron brindle, project leader, said: “i live in toronto and i absolutely take for granted that everything is where it should be and that this map is kind of my world, but for so long that hasn’t been the case in the north.”unlike more populous and accessible parts of the world, which have been mapped using a special camera mounted on a car roof, the iqaluit project had mappers hiking the town’s snow-packed roads and traversing little-known trails, some of which are made of ice and disappear in the brief summer months.the team also cut a path along part of a 15km cul-de-sac known as the road to nowhere, despite warnings about the risk from polar bears and other wildlife.mayor john graham said the digital cartographers were, however, hunted by a herd of excited and curious locals, or google stalkers.graham understands the enthusiasm. the street view project, he said, follows in the footsteps of the english explorer martin frobisher, who in 1576 sailed into the bay where iqaluit now sits while searching for the northwest passage, and the 1941 flight of captain elliott roosevelt, a reconnaissance officer and son of the us president, which led to the site being chosen for a military airbase. his exploration led to the founding of the modern town of iqaluit, which is the seat of government as well as a transport and communications hub for nunavut.one of the initial challenges google faced was gathering the raw data needed to fill in their existing map. what they had created using satellite images was fairly accurate, although the rapid pace of the town’s growth, which has been fuelled by a mining boom, meant they were missing one road that had been created in the past year, said arif sayani, the town’s director of planning.another difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office rather than delivered to their address. plotting the po box addresses would result in a map with firms, banks and schools clustered around the canada post building in the centre of town.about 30 inuit elders, entrepreneurs and high-school pupils turned out one night to help correct such problems. they were provided with a laptop computer and instructed how to ensure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up accurately on the map.the project is more than a novelty or cultural philanthropy. sayani, 32, said the town would be able to use the maps as a promotional tool for those thinking of visiting or moving to the area. it may also speed up planning decisions that will affect iqaluit’s growth.the test run for the iqaluit mapping exercise occurred last summer in cambridge bay, a much smaller nunavut town of about 1,500 people located 1,700km and a time zone west of iqaluit.the gravel roads and muddy puddles that can now be seen online, however, give little sense of life in a land usually covered in snow, which is one reason why google selected the lesshospitable month of march to travel to iqaluit.brindle said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns, though the high costs of shipping and airfares to move people and equipment around the vast arctic territory appears to be weighing on google’s ambitions.the next northern site has not yet been identified but, when it is selected, brindle said the company might simply send one of its hi-tech backpacks and rely on volunteers to literally put themselves on the map.“i’m hoping that three, four, five years from now we’ll look back and see a very different map of canada’s north,” brindle added.
advanced	in homes and cafes across the country, a cup of tea, baked beans on toast and fish and chips have long played a key role in the british dining experience. but, the extent of a change in tastes over the generations has been captured in a dataset published recently in the national food survey, which was set up in 1940 by the government after concerns about health and access to food.despite the apparent british love of tea, consumption has more than halved since the 1970s, falling from 68g of tea per person per week to only 25g. with a teabag or portion of loose tea weighing around 3g, that means britons are drinking on average only eight cups of tea a week today, down from 23 cups in 1974. and, while tea remains the most drunk hot drink in the uk, households now spend more on coffee.the data, published by the department for environment, food and rural affairs as part of its “open data” scheme, is from 150,000 households who took part in the survey between 1974 and 2000, combined with information from 2000 to 2014. it shows some moves towards healthier diets in recent decades, with shifts to low-calorie soft drinks, from whole to skimmed milk and increasing consumption of fresh fruit. but, weekly consumption of chips, pizza, crisps and ready meals has soared.there has also been a dramatic shift from white to brown, wholemeal and other bread but the figures suggest the amount people are eating has fallen from 25 to 15 slices a week over the past four decades, based on a 40g slice from a medium sliced loaf. the consumption of baked beans in sauce has dropped by a fifth despite a rise in other types of convenience food, particularly italian dishes. adults in the uk now eat an average of 75g of pizza every week compared with none in 1974, while the consumption of pasta has almost tripled over the same period.fresh potatoes are also becoming less essential with a 67% decrease from 1974, when adults ate the equivalent of 188g every day. other vegetables such as cucumbers, courgettes, aubergines and mushrooms have gained space on the table. consumption of takeaway food has almost doubled since 1974, from 80g per person per week to 150g. around 33g of this amount is chips and 56g is meat, with kebabs (10g), chicken (7g), burgers (5g) and “meat-based meals” (32g) particularly popular.some trends suggest that british people are becoming more prudent in what they put on their plates, with the average consumption of fruit, both fresh and processed, increasing by 50% since 1974. in 2014, uk adults ate an average of 157g of fruit per day, equivalent to almost two portions of the five-a-day recommendation from the government. bananas have been the most popular fruit in the uk since 1996, reaching 221g per adult per week in 2014, well above apples (131g) and oranges (48g). low-calorie soft drinks represented half of all soft drinks consumed in 2014 for the first time.other social changes emerge from the survey, with questions about owning chickens and getting your own eggs being dropped in 1991 and a somewhat belated end in the same year to asking the “housewife” to fill out the questionnaire. britons are spending a smaller proportion of pay on food today – 11%, compared with 24% in 1974.the uk environment secretary, elizabeth truss, said: “food is the heart and soul of our society and this data not only shows what we were eating 40 years ago but how a change in culture has led to a food revolution. shoppers are more plugged in to where their food comes from than ever before, the internet has brought quality produce to our doorsteps at the click of a button, pop-up restaurants are showcasing the latest trends and exciting global cuisines are now as common as fish and chips.”“by opening up this data, we can look beyond what, where or how previous generations were eating and pinpoint the moments that changed our habits for good. we’ve only scraped the surface of what the national food survey can tell us and, from local food maps and school projects to predicting new food trends, i look forward to seeing how this data can be used to learn more about our past and grow our world-leading food and farming industry in the future.”
advanced	glastonbury festival is to combat the scourge of the plastic water bottle as part of a longterm strategy to become the world’s most environmentally friendly outdoor music event.festival organizers are targeting the disposable bottle, one of the most conspicuous symbols of the throwaway culture, that each year leaves the 900-acre somerset site wreathed in plastic, with an estimated one million plastic bottles being used during the festival.stainless-steel reusable bottles will be given to 2,000 road crew and band members, with thousands more on sale to festival-goers, to stop them relying on plastic bottles. the 140,000 ticket-holders are also being urged to bring reusable bottles that they can fill at 400 drinkingwater taps dotted across the site.lucy smith, glastonbury’s green issues organizer, said: “we have amazing water quality in the uk but everyone is obsessed with drinking bottled water.”she said the initiative precedes a plan for glastonbury 2015 to replace all plastic beer glasses and cutlery with reusable items in an attempt to eradicate the legacy of plastic waste from the huge rural site.environmentalists estimate that 150 million tonnes of plastic waste currently litters the planet and oceans, poisoning ecosystems and killing wildlife.ultimately, festival organizers hope to make glastonbury the world’s greenest greenfield festival, emulating america’s burning man festival in the black rock desert of nevada, which is a “leave-no-trace” event, where people have to take away all that they bring.glastonbury revellers are also being urged to travel to the site on public transport or try car-sharing with friends. “we want to be as sustainable as we can. we do everything we can, but coping with the litter of 140,000 people is a challenge. we can’t put bins everywhere,” added smithcampaigners say that plastic water bottles can take hundreds or even thousands of years to completely biodegrade, with their manufacture exacerbating their negative ecological impact. millions of barrels of oil are used in the manufacture of plastic bottles and the transportation of mineral water across the planet produces even more carbon emissions.overall, an estimated 13 billion plastic water bottles are sold in the uk every year, yet just one in five is said to be recycled.smith said that, instead of buying bottled water, festival-goers should take advantage of the water on tap, which is being drawn from huge underground reservoirs, instead of old-fashioned water tanks that provided heavily chlorinated drinking water. the charity wateraid will also set up water kiosks around the site, stocking reusable bottles and cups, and offering free refills. in 2015, the kiosks – modelled on those found in africa – will double as dj booths at night.organizers say that almost half of all the rubbish left on site was recycled in 2013 and add that there will be 15,000 bins for recycling across the festival grounds in 2014.despite its growing eco-credentials, critics continue to snipe at glastonbury, accusing it of becoming increasingly corporate in tone. the latest critic, iron maiden’s bruce dickinson, has vowed never to bring his band to glastonbury festival after dismissing it as “the most bourgeois thing on the planet”.the weather forecast for glastonbury was positive, with the festival due to be sunny and dry, experts ruling out a repeat of 1985, the festival’s windiest year; 1997, its muddiest; and 2005, known as the “year of thunder”.
