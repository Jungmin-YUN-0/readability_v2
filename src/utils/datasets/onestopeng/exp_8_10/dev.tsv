intermediate	on an average day its outlets host everything from business meetings to reading groups. all these people are looking for that important morning coffee. but starbucks should be careful what it wishes for.the direct action group uk uncut plans to turn dozens of the coffee empire’s uk outlets into crèches, refuges and homeless shelters to highlight starbucks’ tax avoidance tactics.they announced the action as starbucks were questioned by the house of commons public accounts committee. they asked why the company paid no corporation tax in the uk during the past three years, despite the company’s profitable business in britain.when he appears before the committee, starbucks’ chief financial officer, troy alstead, will attempt to repair the company’s reputation.mps accused the hm revenue & customs (hmrc), the uk’s tax department, of having cosy relationships with big businesses. speaking about the arrangements with starbucks, the conservative mp richard bacon said: “it smells. and it doesn’t smell of coffee – it smells bad.”the campaign group uk uncut wants to show a connection between government cuts, in particular those that affect women, and tax avoidance by multinational businesses.sarah greene, a uk uncut activist, said funding for refuges and rape crisis centres would be reduced unless companies paid the fair amount of tax. hmrc estimates around £32bn was lost due to tax avoidance in 2011.greene said the government could easily collect billions that could help pay for necessary services if they were stricter on tax avoidance.the group, which became known because of its protests at vodafone stores, topshop and fortnum & mason, turned its attentions to starbucks beause an investigation discovered the company had paid only £8.6m in corporation tax since launching in the uk in 1998, despite cumulative sales of £3bn.uncut campaigner anna walker said “we’ve chosen to really highlight the impact of the cuts on women. so we’re going to focus on transforming starbucks into those services that the government are cutting, such as refuges and crèches.“starbucks is a really great target because it is on every high street across the country and that’s what uk uncut finds really important: people can take action in their local areas,” she said.several international organizations have been criticized over their uk accounts. amazon, ebay, facebook, google and ikea all pay little or no corporation tax.the coffee store chain, starbucks, insists it pays the correct level of taxes. the group chief executive, howard schultz, has said in a statement: “starbucks has always paid taxes in the uk.“over the last three years alone, our company has paid more than £160m in various taxes, including national insurance*, vat and business rates.”margaret hodge, who leads the public accounts committee, told parliament last month that apple, ebay, facebook, google and starbucks had avoided nearly £900m of tax. the prime minister, david cameron, responded to the claim by saying: “i’m not happy with the current situation. i think [hmrc] needs to look at it very carefully. we do need to make sure we continue to encourage these businesses to invest in our country, but they should be paying fair taxes as well.”a spokeswoman for starbucks said: “while the subject of tax law can be extremely complex, starbucks respects and obeys tax laws and accounting rules in each of the 61 countries where we do business, including the uk. we’ve posted the facts about our tax practices in the uk on our website.“starbucks’ economic impact in the uk goes far beyond our stores and partners [employees]. we spend hundreds of millions of pounds with local suppliers on milk, cakes and sandwiches, and on store design and renovations. when you consider the indirect employment created by starbucks’ investments in the uk, the company’s extended economic impact to the uk economy is more than £80m a year”.nannan
intermediate	brazil’s latest funk sensation, anitta, has won millions of fans by making the favela sound popular, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour.anti-discrimination campaigners and social commentators say the music industry’s fastest rising star has had to give up her blackness to be a success in the predominantly white middle-class market.the controversy began with the publication of then-and-now photographs that show a dramatic lightening of anitta’s skin tone since she signed a deal with warner.in the first photo, when she was quite unknown, she looked darker. in the second – a marketing photo after she became famous – she seems lighter. the contrast has restarted discussion about whether you need to have light skin to get ahead in brazil.jarid arraes, a psychology student and blogger, wrote a post criticizing the discrimination in media and marketing that she felt anitta’s image change represented. “people refuse to accept that they are racist and they think they live in a multiracial democracy, but the statistics show that is far from the case. white is the image of the rich, the nice, the successful, the good, while people see black as the opposite of all that.”born larissa de macedo machado, the diva-to-be was a church chorister in her childhood. in her teens, she made a name for herself in rio de janeiro’s baile funk scene as a dancer and singer.she now has an album and a huge hit single, show das poderosas, which topped the charts and attracted 52 million youtube views.many people love her because she is a pop idol with a strong message and some catchy tunes. her marketing team want people to see her as a cultural bridge between the predominantly black and mixed-race shanty towns on rio’s hillsides and the wealthier and whiter communities below.gangsta references and explicit lyrics of baile funk. now, however, questions are being asked about whether she – or her marketing team – have gone too far in changing her. arraes says that if pop stars have curly hair, they will want to straighten it. if they have a big nose, they will want to make it smaller. it creates a vicious cycle for how you feel about yourself.this is a sensitive topic in this largely mixed-raced nation. brazil – one of the last big countries in the world to ban slavery – has the largest population of african descent outside africa, but race and where your family come from are less important there than colour. there is a clear link between skin tone and inequality.in brazilian cities, white workers earn roughly twice as much as those of african descent. up until 2011, black or mixed-race students also spent two years less at school on average.most business and government executives are white, while most menial jobs are done by black and mixed-race workers. if you walk through ipanema, gávea or other rich districts, you are far more likely to see black nannies pushing strollers with white children than a white nanny pushing a black child.defining colour is complex. people who define themselves as white were in the minority for the first time in the most recent census in 2010. among the 197 million population, 82 million said they were “pardu” (mixed race), 15 million black, two million asian and 0.5% indigenous.sylvio ferreira, a psychology lecturer at the federal university of pernambuco, believes anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it more acceptable to everyone.maycon de mattos batista, a financial analyst who worked with anitta while she was an intern, said there had been a huge change in anitta’s image, but not of her colour.“i don’t believe it’s whitening; it’s more the way they are producing her with makeup, hairstylists and the way she dresses,” he said. “i don’t think that was because of pressure they put on her. she always liked to show off, sing and dance. that was a natural thing for her. i believe that it is because of this naturalness that she is where she is today.”nannannannan
intermediate	according to american researchers, a nasal spray containing the ‘love hormone’ oxytocin could help children with autism behave more normally in social situations. scans of autistic children showed that a single dose of the chemical improved brain responses to facial expressions. this is something that could make social interactions feel more natural and rewarding for them.the researchers said oxytocin might increase the success of behavioural therapies that are already used to help people with autism learn to cope with social situations. “over time, what you would expect to see is more normal social responding, being more interested in interacting with other people, more eye contact and more conversation,” said kevin pelphrey, of yale university.autism is a developmental disorder that more than one in 100 people have. the condition affects people in different ways, but leads to difficulties in social interaction and communication. so far, there is no established treatment for the social problems caused by autism.researchers at yale have studied the brain chemical oxytocin as a possible treatment for the social problems caused by autism because it plays an important role in bonding and trust. results have been mixed, though: one recent study found no significant benefit for young people given the chemical over several days. but pelphrey said oxytocin might help the brain learn from social interactions; it would work best when used with therapies that encourage people with autism to interact more socially, he said.the scientists scanned the brains of 17 young people aged eight to 16 with autism while they looked at images of cars or the eyes of people expressing different emotions. the scans were given 45 minutes after the young people inhaled a placebo or oxytocin through a nasal spray.the scans showed that the reward circuits in the children’s brains behaved more normally after a dose of oxytocin: that is, they were more active when the person was looking at faces and less active when looking at the inanimate cars. the study appears in the latest issue of the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences in the united states.“the study suggests that oxytocin might treat something for which we don’t have a treatment in autism, and that’s the core social motivation,” said pelphrey. he warned that it was too early to use oxytocin as a treatment for the social difficulties caused by autism and said people should not buy oxytocin online. “we don’t want them trying oxytocin at home. it’s impossible to say what they are buying. we are nowhere near thinking this is a ready treatment. it needs more follow-up,” he said. “this is an important new study in identifying changes in brain activity in key areas of the brain,” said simon baron-cohen, director of the autism research centre at cambridge university.a surprising finding, however, is that oxytocin nasal spray did not change performance in social recognition tasks. and, it is also not yet clear if oxytocin only has benefits for people with autism or has any unwanted side effects. finally, oxytocin effects only last about 45 minutes, so there may be practical considerations as to whether this could be used as a treatment.“from a scientific perspective, this study has a lot of evidence from animal and human work to justify serious attention, but more research is needed. doctors should be cautious about the potential of this hormone until we know much more about its benefits and risks, in much larger studies.” said simon baron-cohen.uta frith, who studies autism at university college london, said: “according to this study, oxytocin may have the effect of making faces more interesting. disappointingly, this effect is seen only in brain activity and not in behaviour. demonstrating an effect on behaviour will be critical if nasal spray treatment is to be of any value.”nan
intermediate	back in 2005, when blackberry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone, the company was just entering its boom times. while the iphone was still just an idea, blackberry’s innovations ensured its smartphone was one of canada’s biggest exports.six years later, in the summer of 2011, when there were riots in london and other uk cities, blackberry messenger (bbm) was so effective at mobilizing the rioters that politicians wanted the service to be temporarily shut down. but, two years later, it is the users themselves who are pulling the plug.demand for blackberry phones is falling. dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place, from facebook’s and apple’s instant messaging applications to independent apps such as whatsapp and kik (which is also canadian). they are free to download and use, and they use the internet to swap text messages, pictures, voice clips, ‘stickers’ and even videos between most types of phones.in an attempt to keep its customers, bbm has been released on android and apple phones. despite the competition from other apps, the response has been extraordinary, with more than 20 million downloads. but, despite this interest, many people believe bbm’s wider release will not save the service. “the move to bring blackberry to the iphone is four or five years too late,” says james gooderson, an 18-year-old student who blogs on technology. “whatsapp has made blackberrys unnecessary for young people.”bbm says it has 80 million monthly users after its upgrade, but whatsapp has 300 million. other services show bbm’s limitations: unlike skype and viber, it does not yet offer video or voice calls; unlike path, it does not do location sharing; there is no video sharing, as on imessage; and the stickers (a more sophisticated version of the smiley face), adored by kids all over the world, are also absent. even the contacts and calendar sharing that bbm made possible on blackberry phones are not on the apple and android versions.messaging is moving from verbal to visual. photos uploaded to instagram get instant comments and snapchat’s pictures, which selfdelete after ten seconds, have opened a world of other possibilities. like bbm, all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection. but as recently as 2011, bbm was so powerful it helped to start a revolution in egypt; and at the time of the london riots, it was a more immediate source of news than the television screen.“we could see on our blackberry messages where the rioters were going next; tv news would catch up four hours later,” said jean- pierre moore, 28. he manages a youth club in stockwell, south london, an area with some of the highest levels of crime and poverty in britain. moore mainly communicates on an ipad now. he does not agree with the idea that a shutdown of bbm would have stopped the looting. “the social networking wasn’t the reason,” he says.nearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application but two-thirds use more than one. among 16- to 24-year-olds, 60% use facebook every day, but 46% use alternatives. “it’s a much more complex, multifaceted environment,” says benedict evans, a digital media specialist. “all of these apps use your smartphone – they plug into your phone book and your photo library. apps rise and fall like fireworks. some, like instagram, last; others just disappear.”thirteen-year-old bennett has three phones. he keeps his blackberry for messaging, uses an iphone to play games, and makes phone calls on an android phone. his friends are still on bbm. at the touch of a few buttons, a single blackberry message can be sent to the phone owner’s entire contacts book – several hundred people, in some cases; on whatsapp, the limit for a broadcast message is 50. but, for bennett, instagram is now a major social network. “instagram is facebook without parents,” he says. “facebook has been taken over by the older generation. when i saw my mum on facebook, i deleted my account.”the low cost of buying and communicating on a blackberry is still an advantage. unlimited bbm messages are available to anyone with a secondhand was a belief that encrypted words sent over the company’s secure servers could not be traced back to their writers. arrests and prosecutions after the riots put an end to that belief. phone and a £7-a-month deal from a telecoms company. but people no longer trust the privacy of bbm. part of the attraction to business people, revolutionaries, demonstrators and riotersacross town from stockwell, outside the gates of a private school in the rich district of south kensington, the older pupils all have apple logos on their phones. they all use whatsapp. for many, bbm is a distant memory. “i still have a blackberry, but i’m the only one,” says a teenager standing with a circle of friends. and how does that make him feel? “isolated,” he replies.
intermediate	until the end, david bowie, who has died of cancer, was still full of surprises. his latest album, blackstar, appeared on his 69th birthday on 8 january 2016 and proved that he hadn’t lost his gift for making dramatic statements as well as challenging, disturbing music.throughout the 1970s, bowie was a trailblazer of musical trends and pop fashion. he became a singer-songwriter, a pioneer of glam-rock, then got into what he called “plastic soul”, before moving to berlin to create innovative electronic music. his ability to mix brilliant changes of sound and image is unique in pop history.bowie was born david robert jones in south london. in 1953, the family moved to kent, where david showed talent for singing and playing the recorder. later, he studied art, music and design.at 15, david formed his first band, the kon-rads. it was clear that david’s talents and ambition meant that he should go solo. david took the name bowie to avoid confusion with davy jones of the monkees.bowie’s first album, released in june 1967, was titled simply david bowie. in july 1969, bowie released space oddity, the song that would give him his first commercial breakthrough. timed to coincide with the apollo 11 moon landing, it was a top five uk hit.in march 1970, bowie married art student, angela barnett. the man who sold the world was released in the us in late 1970 and in the uk the following year. with its daring songwriting and broody, hard-rock sound, it was the first album to really show his writing and performing gifts. the album’s themes included immortality, insanity, murder and mysticism, which showed that bowie was a songwriter who was thinking outside of pop’s usual boundaries.he followed it with 1972’s hunky dory, a mix of wordy, elaborate songwriting. it was an excellent collection that met with only moderate success but that all changed with the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars later that year.this time, bowie appeared as a science-fiction character – an intergalactic glam-rock star visiting planet earth. the hit single starman brought instant success for the album.everything bowie touched turned to gold. he had his first uk number 1 album with aladdin sane (1973), which included the hit singles the jean genie and drive-in saturday. but bowie was already planning his next career moves.his increasing interest in funk and soul music could be heard on the album young americans (1975), which gave him a us chart-topper with fame (with john lennon as a guest vocalist).with the album station to station (1976), bowie introduced a new persona, the thin white duke. this persona was the same as his role as a sad space traveller in nicolas roeg’s film the man who fell to earth.bowie’s relationship with his wife had been suffering under the pressures of success and the couple divorced in 1980. this was a year of further creative triumph, bringing a fine album, scary monsters (and super creeps), and its chart-topping single, ashes to ashes, followed by a period playing the title role in the elephant man on the broadway stage.he achieved a number 1 single with his 1981 partnership with queen, under pressure, and became increasingly involved with different media. he appeared in the german movie christiane f (1981) and wrote music for the soundtrack. he had another chart hit with cat people (putting out fire) from paul schrader’s movie cat people (1982).1983 was the year in which he put his energy into the album let’s dance and follow-up concerts. let’s dance turned bowie into a crowd-friendly global rock star, with the album and its singles let’s dance, china girl and modern love all becoming huge international hits.this was the heyday of mtv and bowie’s talent for eye-catching videos increased his popularity, while the six-month serious moonlight tour drew massive crowds. it was to be the most commercially successful period of his career.at the 1985 live aid famine relief concert at wembley stadium, bowie was one of the best performers. in addition, that year, he teamed up with mick jagger to record the fundraising single dancing in the street, which quickly went to number 1.a few days after his appearance at the freddie mercury tribute concert at wembley stadium in april 1992, bowie married the somalian model iman and the couple bought a home in new york.for the album black tie white noise (1993), he included elements of soul, electronica and hip hop. it topped the uk album chart and gave him a top 10 single, jump they say.new media and technology influenced his recordings, too. his 1999 album hours… was based around music he had written for a computer game called omikron, in which bowie and iman appeared as characters. the birth of bowie and iman’s daughter, alexandria, followed in august 2000.as an adopted new yorker, bowie was the opening act at the concert for new york city in october 2001, where he joined paul mccartney, jon bon jovi, billy joel, the who and elton john in a benefit show six weeks after the 9/11 attacks.during his reality tour in 2004, bowie had chest pains while performing in germany and needed emergency surgery in hamburg.he saw the medical emergency as a warning and started to slow down. in february 2006, he was given a grammy lifetime achievement award. he was entered into the rock and roll hall of fame in 1996.the next day (2013) was his first album of new material in a decade. it included the single where are we now?, which gave him his first uk top 10 hit since 1993. the album went to the top of the charts in britain and around the world. in 2014, bowie was given the brit award for best british male, making him the oldest person to get the award.he is survived by iman, their daughter, alexandria, his stepdaughter, zulekha, and his son, duncan, from his first marriage.
intermediate	as soon as the children at one primary school in stirling, scotland, hear the words òdaily mileó, they put down their pencils and leave the classroom to start running around the school  eld. for three-and-a-half years, all the pupils at st ninianõs primary school have walked or run a mile each day. they do it at different times during the day and, despite the rise in childhood obesity across the uk, none of the children at the school are overweight.the daily mile has done so much to improve these childrenõs  tness, behaviour and concentration in lessons that many other british schools are doing the same. they are getting pupils to get up from their desks and take 15 minutes to walk or run round the school or local park.elaine wyllie, headteacher of st ninianõs, said: òi get at least two emails a day from other schools and local authorities asking how we do it. the thought of children across the country running every day because of something weõve done is phenomenal.one in ten children are obese when they start school at the age of four or  ve, according to the health & social care information centre, and, in the summer of 2015, a study found that schoolchildren in england are the least  t they have ever been. primary schools therefore accept the bene ts of the daily mile. it has been introduced in schools in various parts of the uk and other schools are planning to launch the initiative during the 2015-16 academic year. in stirling alone, 30 schools have already started or will soon start the daily mile.òitõs a common-sense approach to childrenõs  tness, which is free and easy. the most important thing is that the children really enjoy it; otherwise, you couldnõt sustain it. they come back inside bright-eyed and rosy-cheeked, how children used to look,ó said wyllie. at st ninianõs, teachers take their pupils out of lessons to a specially built circuit around the schoolõs playing  eld for their daily mile whenever it best suits that dayõs timetable. only ice or very heavy rain stop them.the extent of the bene ts isnõt known yet but researchers from stirling university have launched a comparative study to look for evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile. dr colin moran, who is leading the study, said: òthe children donõt seem to have problems with obesity; they seem happier and staff say they settle into lessons faster so we designed a study that would test all of these things.ó st ninianõs pupils will be compared with children from another school in stirling that hasnõt yet started the scheme.kevin clelland, a primary school teacher from leeds, visited st ninianõs and, then, convinced his colleagues it was a great idea. he said: òitõs such a simple thing to do but seems to have such an amazing impact. weõre really committed to improving the  tness of our pupils.ó his school is now building a track.active cheshire, a sports and  tness organization in cheshire, is taking a group of senior people from the local authority up to scotland to assess the results of the daily mile. the hope is to introduce it across the 450 schools in their region if a pilot programme is successful.paralympian, tanni grey-thompson, chair of ukactive, a health organization for physical activity, said: òall children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day, whether in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground. itõs fantastic to see initiatives like the daily mile, showing real leadership from the education sector to improve childrenõs  tness levels and their cognitive behaviour, and make a real difference to schools, teachers, parents and young peopleõs lives. we know sitting still kills; not sitting still helps children build skills that will stay with them for life.óthe scottish government also supports the initiative. a spokesperson said: òlearning in pe is enhanced by initiatives like the daily mile, which can encourage and support parents in fostering healthy habits with their children from a young age. we are pleased to see so many scottish schools are taking part or planning to do so.ó
intermediate	the problem with google glasses, says takahito iguchi, is that they’re not cool. he may be right. there’s already a website dedicated to people wearing them looking either ridiculous or smug or, more often, both. search google images and one of the first hits is a picture of a large, naked man wearing them in the shower. and it’s this that iguchi, a japanese entrepreneur, hopes may be google’s achilles’ heel. he is launching a competitor that is a bit more stylish. a bit more blade runner. a bit more japanese.iguchi’s augmented reality glasses aren’t really glasses – they are more a single piece of metal with a camera and a tiny projector. they are called telepathy one and, since they were presented to the public for the first time in austin, texas, they have attracted $5m of venture capital. like glass, telepathy one is due to launch in 2014.it’s a simplified version of google glass. glass has a range of uses – you can surf the internet, read emails, take photographs – but telepathy will be “more of a communication device”. connected via bluetooth to your phone, it will focus on real-time visual and audio sharing. you’ll be able to post photos and videos from your line of vision on facebook or send them as an email, or see and speak to a video image of a friend.“it will help bring you close to your friends and family. we are very focused on the communication and sharing possibilities,” says iguchi, who has worked in the japanese technology industry for 20 years.of course, not everyone wants to get closer to the man in the futuristic headset, i tell him. iguchi shakes his head. “i’m a visionary. i have a dream that people will understand other people. when i go to london, i am a stranger. sometimes i feel fear. but i believe that everyone wants to be understood and to understand each other. and, with this device, you can know more information about people before you even speak to them.”compared to google, telepathy is a minnow, but iguchi doesn’t seem to worry. in his shared office space in san francisco – a cool, converted warehouse – he quotes sun tzu’s the art of war and says that even tiny armies can sometimes beat powerful forces. when he was growing up, japanese technology ruled the world: the sony walkman was the iphone of its day. now, to compete, he’s had to leave tokyo and go to silicon valley.“tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture but it’s still an island. it’s isolated. there is not any way to expand. whereas, in silicon valley, everyone is from everywhere. it’s where you come to connect globally.” the hardware will be made in japan, and he is putting together a team of software engineers in the us to develop its applications.building the prototype of telepathy one was easy, iguchi says. “we have every sort of technology in tokyo. it is presenting it to the world that is the challenge.” the top manufacturers all want to work with him, he says, because they have the technology, they just struggle to sell it. “there needs to be a story to the product. like apple did with the ipod – 1,000 songs in your pocket. and steve jobs was inspired by akio morita, the co-founder of sony, and he inspired me, so maybe it will come in a circle.”maybe. he certainly has the confidence of jobs, but, with a thick japanese accent, he sometimes struggles to make himself understood, a fact that may have contributed to his idea for telepathy one. when he went to london to present the headset, he stayed in an airbnb. “the house owner was not my friend but i talked with him for three hours, and now he is my friend. that is how long it takes to understand each other, to share our feelings, and background, and career. maybe telepathy makes that quicker. if you are getting info from the cloud and social networks, that will happen more easily.”iguchi hopes that seeing somebody else’s i suddenly realized that everything is code. everything is coded and is shareable between humans. and everything can be encoded and decoded. and, if code is exchangeable between humans, that will end all war.” literal point of view will help you to see their metaphorical point of view. as a student, he explains, he studied philosophy by day and taught himself how to code by night. “and, one day, i opened the door of my apartment and
intermediate	the atmosphere at the beginning of the final series of downton abbey is one of melancholy and changing times. the year is 1925. the neighbours are selling up their own stately home, while lord grantham wants to cut back on servants.but, at the real downton abbey, highclere castle – a stately home owned by george “geordie” herbert, 8th earl of carnarvon – they have more money than before. according to lady fiona carnarvon, the huge global success of downton has paid for building repairs that are needed to save highclere for the next generation.“it’s been an amazing magic carpet ride for all of us,” she said. “it’s given us free marketing and an international profile. i’m hugely grateful. my husband and i love highclere castle. now, it is loved by millions of other people.”currently, only the ground and first floors of highclere, on the borders of hampshire, are used. but, a restoration project of tower rooms has begun that will eventually allow visitors to climb up into the tower to an exhibition showing the work of the architect of the houses of parliament, sir charles barry, who rebuilt the house between 1839 and 1842.when the downton abbey producers first approached highclere in 2009, the family had £12 million of repairs to do – £1.8 million of that work was urgent. but, by 2012, downton abbey was having a positive effect. lord carnarvon said then: “it was just after the banking crisis and we were worried. then, downton began and highclere became a major tourist attraction.”visitor numbers doubled, to 1,200 a day, as downton abbey, written by julian fellowes, was shown around the world after becoming a hit in the uk in 2010 and, then, in the us. it is now broadcast in 250 countries.there is now a computerized advance booking system, which helps foreign visitors to buy tickets. highclere’s current assets have almost trebled to around £1 million since 2012. gareth neame, the executive producer for the series, said: “i think downton abbey secured highclere’s future.”peter fincham, itv’s director of television, remembers the moment when highclere was booked. “i thought, ‘so what?’, because i had never heard of highclere castle. i thought, ‘every stately home looks the same.’ but i was wrong. the castle has been an enormous character as well.”the downton tourists are part of a growing phenomenon. visitbritain estimates that nearly 30% of foreign visitors, or nearly nine million people, visit castles and historic houses. almost half of visitors to britain now say they want to visit places from films or tv.more than a million take a tour of historic buildings each year, spending more than £1 billion. fifty-one per cent of brazilians, 42% of russians and chinese, and 35% of indian visitors are likely to include a visit to a site of interest in their trips.visitbritain’s director, patricia yates, said: “the links between tourism, films and tv are strong.” she added that period dramas have also increased the popularity of places outside of london.“downton abbey expresses a certain view of britain. it is a fantasy world, based in a particular time in history. it’s the first tv period drama that has really become part of popular culture.”lady carnarvon says that the long-term future of highclere is not necessarily secure. but, she says, “the programme has allowed us to spend faster on the buildings.”highclere castle plans a tutankhamun event in 2022, 100 years after the 5th earl of carnarvon discovered tutankhamun’s tomb with howard carter. another opportunity to keep highclere in the public mind is the 300th anniversary of the birth of lancelot “capability” brown, who designed the grounds.“every single day, don’t take anything for granted,” said lady carnarvon. “you have to invest in all these great houses. and, there has been a deficit since the 1930s. in the past, an estate and house supported the family and their lifestyle but, today, it is quite the reverse: the challenge is how geordie and i can support highclere.“i’ve tried to persuade people it is fun. we have specific events they can engage with, not just a walk around a dusty house. we have to compete with attractions like the london dungeon.”nannan
intermediate	flappy bird be careful what you wish for, especially if you want to invent something new. recently, dong nguyen, the designer of the mobile game flappy bird, removed it from app stores. he said its success – it had been downloaded more than 50 million times and was making him around £30,000 from advertising each day – had ruined his simple life. on his twitter account, he said: “i cannot take this anymore.” ok, so regretting making flappy bird isn’t quite the same as regretting making a rifl e, but nguyen is just the latest inventor who wished he hadn’t created a monster.the labradoodle the labradoodle isn’t a monster – it’s adorable. but what’s monstrous is the way crossbreed dogs have been sold since the labradoodle’s inventor, wally conron, fi rst created the breed in the 1980s. “i’ve done a lot of damage,” he told the associated press. “i’ve created a lot of problems. there are a lot of unhealthy and abandoned dogs out there.” conron came up with the labradoodle when he was working for the royal guide dog association of australia to provide a dog for a blind woman whose husband was allergic to dog hair. what he didn’t expect was that the labradoodle – and other types of poodle-cross dogs, many of which have health problems – would become so popular.the ak-47 six months before his death in december 2013, mikhail kalashnikov, the designer of the assault rifl e, wrote to the head of the russian orthodox church: “my spiritual torment is unbearable. if my rifl e killed people, does that mean that i, mikhail kalashnikov, 93 years of age, the son of a poor farmer, christian and orthodox by faith, am responsible for people’s deaths, even if they were enemies?”electronic tagging the electronic tag was originally made in the 1960s as a way of tracking former prisoners’ attendance at school and work, and rewarding them for good behaviour. its inventors, bob gable and his brother kirkland, were later horrifi ed that the tag had become a form of control and punishment. “it’s not pleasant,” kirkland gable told the guardian in 2010, “but i’m not in control of the universe. i have to realize there are some things out of my control.”pepper spray after police sprayed peaceful protesters with pepper spray at a university of california campus in 2011, one of the scientists who helped develop it in the 80s denounced its use. “i have never seen such an inappropriate use of chemicals,” kamran loghman told the new york times.the offi ce cubicle in the late 60s, a new form of offi ce was designed to give workers privacy and increase productivity by providing more work space. instead, it became a way for companies to put employees into tighter spaces. these days, the cubicle is often connected with uniformity and soulless work. its inventor, bob propst, said, in 1997, “the use of cubicles in modern corporations is crazy.”
intermediate	on one day in august, one in seven people on earth, 1 billion people, used facebook, according to founder mark zuckerberg. in ten years, the social network has completely changed peopleõs relationships, privacy, their businesses, news media, helped to end regimes and even changed the meanings of common words.òa more open and connected world is a better world. it brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society,ó wrote zuckerberg.these are just some of the ways his company changed everything ð for better or worse.1 facebook has changed the de nition of òfriendó òto friendó is now a verb. and, unlike in real life, it is easy to òunfriendó someone, a word invented to describe ending a facebook friendship when that person is no longer improving your facebook newsfeed.although the meanings of the words òshareó and òlikeó are basically the same, facebook has made the terms more important to us.school and university reunions are unnecessary ð you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and youõve seen pictures of your schoolmatesõ babies. you wonõt be surprised to see an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyõre dating someone else from the romantic sel es.but, unlike in real life, on facebook, all your friends have the same importance. a classmate from university who you havenõt seen for 15 years, a friend-of-a-friend from a party or a colleague youõve never actually spoken to in person ð they are all facebook friends in the same way as your closest friend or your spouse or your mum.it doesnõt necessarily mean we see them the same way. professor robin dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have about 150 people as a social group. facebook hasnõt changed that yet, he believes. but dunbar says he fears it is so easy simply to end friendships on facebook that, eventually, people may not need to learn to get on with each other.2 we care less about privacy the surprising thing is that facebook users happily hand over their information.pew research center found that most young people are more than willing to hand over their details. ninety- one per cent post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.but, because so much of a personõs life is shared online, facebook gives people a way to create an image and a fanbase. academics have described a new phenomenon: the òfacebook selfó.more than 80% of facebook users list their interests, which allows brands to target them effectively. but most younger users limit who can see their pro les, with 60% allowing friends only.3 facebook has created millions of jobs ð but not in its own of ces facebook provides indirect employment for people whose job it is to make facebook work for their brand.òit is a tool like no other,ó said michael tinmouth, a social media strategist who has worked with brands such as vodafone and microsoft. òmarketers have an understanding of a brandõs customers like they have never had before. the data available is extraordinary. you know who your customers are, who they are friends with and how they engage with your brand.óand advertisers pay a lot for that. facebook reported advertising revenue had increased by 46%, reaching $3.32bn.facebook is also a mine eld for brands. suddenly, customers donõt simply complain on the phone to a customer service representative or on a small specialist internet forum ð angry customers can post their complaints for hundreds of their friends to see or even on the brandõs own page.4 facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by facebook. manchester universityõs olga onuch found facebook had been the key way for reaching half of all the euromaidan protesters in ukraine. many of the people interviewed in onuchõs research said they relied on facebook for the truth about what was happening ð they donõt trust traditional media.5 facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news about 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63% of users overall, according to the pew research center. about a third of facebook users post about politics and government.most people will  rst read an item of breaking news via facebook or other social media, mostly on mobiles.facebook has also changed the ways journalists write stories. it is a resource many reporters cannot now live without. for better or (often) worse, it is a place to  nd information on almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly  nd themselves at the centre of the dayõs biggest news story.6 users are changing facebook it used to be a site for students of top us universities.in 2014, ten years after its launch, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a facebook account. and 39% are connected to people they have never met in person.more than ever, the site is a gateway not just to your friends but to the rest of the internet.we may as well get used to it, said david kirkpatrick, author of the facebook effect. òit might very well go away further down the road but something this big takes a long time to disappear,ó he told bbc radio 4õs today programme. òfacebook has proven its ability to change and it will continue to be a very, very major player.ónannan

elementary	mcdonaldõs is the worldõs biggest burger chain and a symbol of american consumer capitalism. but, these days, the golden arches of mcdonaldõs are not looking so golden. the company has got much bigger since 2003 but, now, the numbers of customers are falling. mcdonaldõs says that its worldwide sales have fallen by 3.3%.the company has problems almost everywhere. in china, sales fell by 23%. in europe, sales fell by 4%, mostly because of problems in ukraine and the anti-western mood in russia. health inspectors have investigated around 200 of mcdonaldõs 450 restaurants in russia and they have closed ten restaurants.but the worst crisis is in the us, where mcdonaldõs has around 40% of its restaurants. almost 60 years since ray kroc opened his  rst restaurant in des plaines, illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a big mac and fries. sales have fallen every month for 12 months in the us. many younger diners are eating at rival companies such as chipotle mexican grill. the number of 19-to-21-year-olds who visit mcdonaldõs once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011.another problem is that mcdonaldõs hamburgers were recently named the worst in america in a poll of more than 32,000 american diners ð they said they would rather eat a burger at five guys, smashburger or fuddruckers. many people also believe that mcdonaldõs is less healthy than most of its rivals, especially chipotle. chipotle uses antibiotic-free meat and òlocally sourced, seasonaló ingredients.mcdonaldõs asked customers for their opinions in the us in october. someone asked òhave you ever used pink slime in your burgers?ó ð ôpink slimeõ is the beef  ller that is used for dog food. mcdonaldõs stopped using this meat product in 2012 but mcdonaldõs chief executive don thompson said the company still had to improve peopleõs opinions about the freshness and quality of its ingredients.mcdonaldõs has always had a reputation for fast service at low prices. but, since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, people think it is more expensive than its rivals and many consumers complain that service is slower.but mary chapman at food analysts technomic said that it wasnõt fair to say that mcdonaldõs was more expensive than its rivals. òprices have gone up but they havenõt gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-food chains in the us.ó prices at mcdonaldõs have increased by 4.8% since 2009, much less than the fast-food average (up 19.4%).but people are right when they complain that the queues are longer. mcdonaldõs has a bigger menu than some other restaurants, with more complicated items ð its chicken mcwrap takes 60 seconds to make. òi think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not,ó said chapman.mcdonald managers are promising to improve peopleõs opinions about its food in the us. thompson has promised more organic food and òbuild your own burgersó. but, to reduce queues, he also wants to introduce simpler menus. how can the company have simpler menus and, at the same time, a larger selection of  llings? òthey want to simplify the menu but also offer ôbuild your own burgersõ ð that sounds tricky,ó said consumer expert mark kalinowski. only four out of mcdonaldõs 14,000 us restaurants have tested òbuild your own burgeró, he said. òright now, we are sceptical; we would like to see more detail.ósales are falling but mcdonaldõs continues to expand around the world: by the end of 2014, it expects to open 1,400 new restaurants. kalinowski thinks that mcdonaldõs sales will continue to fall but he thinks it will be number one for many years.nannannan
elementary	not many exercise classes have a tea break in the middle. but margaret allen’s class has one. after a gentle warm-up and a few quick exercises, the 93-year-old great-grandmother lets her group sit down and relax with a cup of tea. some of the eight people in the class look like they need a break, but allen is not even sweating.the general rule is that eating just before doing sport is not a good idea and especially not halfway through the class. but, on the afternoon i visit allen’s class in saltburnby- the-sea, they eat fruitcake during the break. the cake was made for allen’s recent birthday by her 89-year-old sister, joan.the ladies have just finished their cake when allen gets up again. she plays a lively scottish song and there is lots of toe pointing and leg kicking. forty-five minutes later, the class is finally over.allen has been leading classes in the north-east town for 45 years. she wasn’t very sporty at school, but she started playing the piano for a keep-fit class during the second world war and started leading the class in her 40s when the old instructor retired.at one time, allen’s class had more than 18 regulars, each paying £1 a time. but, these days, the group is getting smaller. during the tea break, the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them went to that week for one of the younger people in the group who died recently, aged 68.allen is the oldest, her sister the second oldest. the baby of the group is 60-year-old jean cunion, who is a bit embarrassed to say that she is perhaps the least fit of the group. “i remember, the first time i came, margaret said, ‘who’s that breathing heavily?’ and i had to say it was me.” ruth steere, 76, says allen always has her back to the class, but she always knows what’s happening: “she always shouts at us if we go wrong. she’s very good at knowing what we are doing.”allen, who loves dancing, has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor. instead, she got ideas for her own moves from five fitness videos from the bbc. allen thinks she is healthy because she keeps busy, especially since her husband died in 1997. she started writing poetry when she was 80.“i write poems about everything. i just can’t stop,” she says, when she phones me a few days after the interview to read out a poem she has written about the joys of exercise. she still plays the piano and gives speeches. she also did a computer course when she was 88.ageing is no fun, she says. she reads me a few lines from a poem she has written called ‘that beast called age’. she happily remembers a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years ago, who said he didn’t believe she was more than 78: “i said, ‘thank you, doctor. you can go now.’”she also has a practical idea for people who are overweight: “i just think people shouldn’t eat too much. when i hear someone say, ‘oh, i can’t lose weight’, i say: ‘sellotape.’” she mimes taping her mouth shut. “i said this the other day to a big fat man. everything in moderation is my motto.”earlier in 2013, allen was watching the news and saw a woman get the british empire medal. “the woman said: ‘i’m 80 and i’m the oldest fitness instructor in the country!’ i thought: ‘no, you’re not.’” but allen won’t write to the queen to complain.nannan

elementary	the international monetary fund (imf) has asked the usa to manage its money better. hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work after the government shut down for 16 days.us president barack obama said that the us has to be more careful with how it manages its money. the imf’s managing director, christine lagarde, asked for more stability.the senate wrote a peace deal, which included almost nothing that the conservatives asked for. the conservative republicans nearly caused a new financial crisis because they did not agree to obama’s healthcare reforms. the house of representatives agreed the deal at the last minute.the world bank was also pleased that the world’s economy had “avoided a catastrophe”. its president, jim yong kim, asked politicians in all countries to continue to make policies that improve the economy and give jobs and opportunity to all.the shutdown cost the us $24 billion.obama signed the legislation shortly after midnight on thursday. the bill passed easily, with support from all parties in the senate, where democratic and republican leaders wrote the agreement. it is a temporary solution. it gives the government money until 15 january and allows the government to borrow more money if they want to until 7 february.but the president made clear that he did not expect another serious budget fight and shutdown in 2014.at the white house, obama said he hoped the deal would “lift the cloud of uncertainty” that had hung over the country in recent weeks.“when this agreement arrives on my desk, i will sign it immediately,” he said. “hopefully, next time, it won’t be in the eleventh hour. we must manage our money better.”a journalist asked the president if the crisis would happen again in a few months. obama replied: “no.”earlier, the republican senator mike lee said there would be more trouble: “the media keeps asking: ‘was it worth it?’ my answer is, it is always worth it to do the right thing.” he added: “this is not over.”but the political deal on wednesday was one of the worst of all possible results for republicans. they did not achieve any of their goals and most people blamed them for the crisis.nannannan
elementary	james bond films are one of the world’s oldest and most successful film series. twenty-three bond films have been made so far. they have earned more than $6 billion at cinemas around the world. james bond is not slowing down. in fact, the films are more popular than ever – skyfall, which broke all records and became the biggest ever film at uk cinemas in 2012, earned a total of $1.1 billion.so, there was a lot of interest when they announced more details about the 24th bond film – especially its title, spectre. the number one question is: can spectre be as successful as skyfall?charles gant, film editor for heat magazine, thinks it can. “they were very clever when they made skyfall,” he says. “it was both modern and retro. daniel craig fans liked it and, also, older, more nostalgic bond fans, who lost interest over the previous few films. with the new title,” he adds, “it is certain to be a success.”eon productions is the company, started in 1961, that made dr no and all the “official” bond films. the company really wants the next film to be successful so it is using the same people that worked on skyfall in the new film. daniel craig will play bond and the same people have written the script. most importantly, sam mendes will again be the director. according to gant, mendes is the best bond director. gant says: “mendes attracted top actors like ralph fiennes. actors like fiennes will only be in a film if they like the director.”the bond series was not in trouble before the arrival of mendes – and craig – but the films were becoming a bit boring towards the end of pierce brosnan’s time as bond. there were no longer any more original bond stories to adapt and the films no longer had enough energy.this was nothing new: the history of the bond series has been one of constant change, especially of the lead actor: first, sean connery; then, george lazenby, roger moore, timothy dalton, brosnan and, now, craig. each new actor has been different and some have been better than others.lazenby only did one bond film. dalton’s two films, the living daylights and licence to kill, were during a period in the late 80s when more aggressive hollywood action movies were more popular. according to gant, “the period of roger moore’s last films and dalton’s films didn’t excite audiences. brosnan was more successful but craig is the best. on the other hand, the early bond films were sexy and exciting.”skyfall made more money than all the other bond films. but some of the 1960s bond films were almost as successful. with figures adjusted for inflation, the 1965 film thunderball is only a little bit below skyfall. and goldfinger and you only live twice both did better than the other craig films. licence to kill made the least money of all bond films and moore’s final film, a view to a kill, the second least.martin campbell is an experienced british director and he planned one of the most elaborate stunts in bond history. in the famous first scene of goldeneye (released in 1995), bond falls into a light aeroplane without a pilot. this scene helped to make the bond series more modern and popular. also, a very successful goldeneye video game created new, younger fans of bond and made people think that the bond film was no longer boring and old-fashioned.nannannannannan
elementary	when pope benedict xvi was elected in 2005, he said he was “a simple, humble worker in god’s vineyard”. and on a grey, cold, windy monday in february, he resigned in the same way: like an old workman with pains in his back and no more strength in his arms. the first german pope in modern times gave an exact departure time. “from 28 february 2013, at 20.00 hours”, he told a gathering of cardinals in the vatican, “the see of rome, the see of saint peter, will be vacant and there will be an election for a new pope.”one of the cardinals at the gathering was a mexican cardinal, monsignor oscar sanchéz barba, from guadalajara. he was in rome for an official meeting. “we were all in the apostolic palace,” he said. “the pope took a sheet of paper and read from it.“we were all …” – sanchéz barba couldn’t find the word. the cardinals had just heard the man they believe is god’s representative on earth resign. “the cardinals were just looking at one another,” sanchéz barba said.angelo sodano, the dean of the college of cardinals, who probably already knew about the pope’s decision, gave a short speech. he told the pope that the cardinals would be loyal to him and added that he and the others present had listened to the pope’s words with a feeling of confusion. at the end of his speech, the pope blessed the cardinals and left. “it was so simple; the simplest thing you can imagine,” said sanchéz barba. “then we all left in silence. there was absolute silence … and sadness.”john thavis spent 30 years reporting on the vatican and has a book, the vatican diaries, that will be published soon. he said he had a feeling before that the pope was going to resign. thavis said that in the long interview benedict gave to a german journalist in 2010, he had said he would resign if he felt he could no longer do the job. “i asked myself: if i were pope and wanted to resign, when would i choose? he has completed his series of books and most of his projects. also, there were no dates in his calendar of events he had to attend. i thought the most likely date was 22 february but i got it wrong.”soon after the announcement, the vatican was saying that the pope’s decision was brave. thavis agreed: “what i find particularly courageous is that he is going now, when he is not sick; and that he’s leaving because he’s tired and not because he’s ill.” but is that the whole story? does the pope know more about his state of health than the vatican has so far made public?benedict said that he is resigning not just for physical reasons but also for psychological reasons. he said that the position of pope needed both strength of mind and strength of body, and in the last few months he felt that he was slowly losing that strength. there will no doubt be other theories in future days and weeks, just as there were following the death of pope john paul i in 1978, 33 days after his election. already people are saying that there was a secret in benedict’s past and that somebody was going to tell everyone. the vatican will no doubt say those stories are nonsense. but we can understand why some people think there might be a secret, because benedict’s decision is so historic.at st peter’s basilica, julia rochester, from london, still didn’t know what the pope’s resignation meant. “if you’re god’s chosen person, how do you choose not be chosen?” she asked. it is a question many catholics will be asking their priests in future weeks.
elementary	a menu scandal at some of japan’s top hotels and department stores is damaging the international reputation of japanese food.one luxury hotel group admitted that it lied about ingredients on its menus. since then, there have been similar stories from restaurants run by famous hotels and department stores in japan.the story began when the hankyu-hanshin hotel group admitted that it gave false descriptions of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and october 2013.for example, the red salmon ‘caviar’ that customers ordered was in fact the eggs of the flying fish.the hotel group’s president, hiroshi desaki, went on television to announce a 20% pay cut for himself and 10% for other executives. but this did not make customers less angry.days later, desaki resigned – he said that the hotel group had betrayed their customers.so far, the company has refunded 20 million yen to more than 10,000 consumers. in total, they will refund 110 million yen.customers who believed they ate expensive kuruma shrimps were told they in fact ate much cheaper black tiger shrimps.complained in a blogpost that a ‘scallop’ dish he ordered at the prince hotel in tokyo contained a similar, but cheaper, type of shellfish.the hotel investigated the complaint and as a result corrected more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants. its report scared hankyu-hanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they, too, lied to customers who believed they were paying high prices for top ingredients.the hotel okura group – where barack obama has stayed – said they also injected beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly described tomatoes as organic.“we apologize for lying to our clients,” it said.the list of fraudulent ingredients gets bigger: orange juice from cartons that was sold as freshly squeezed; mont blanc desserts with korean chestnuts instead of the french ones on the menu; shop-bought chocolate cream that the menu said was home-made; imported beef sold as expensive wagyu beef.the menu scandal has come at the wrong time. japan is trying to persuade south korea and other countries to start to buy japanese food again after the fukushima nuclear accident.food industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 forced luxury hotels to save money.“menu descriptions were created to sound good to the customers, and, when hotels couldn’t get the ingredients on the menu, they just used food from different places,” hiroshi tomozawa, a hotel and restaurant consultant, told kyodo news.nannannannannannan
elementary	many of us know we donõt get enough sleep but imagine if there was a simple solution: getting up later. in a speech at the british science festival, dr paul kelley from oxford university said schools should stagger their starting times to work with the natural rhythms of their students. this would improve exam results and studentsõ health (lack of sleep can cause diabetes, depression, obesity and other health problems).dr kelley said that, when children are around ten, their natural wake-up time is about 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and, at 18, a personõs natural waking hour is 9am, although you may think they are just a lazy teenager. the normal school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not for 16- to 18-year-olds. for the older teenagers, it might be better to start the school day at 11am or even later. òa 7am wake-up time for older teenagers,ó says kelley, òis the same as a 4.30am start for a teacher in their 50s.óhe says the solution is not to tell teenagers to go to bed earlier. òthe bodyõs natural rhythm is controlled by a particular kind of light,ó says kelley. òthe eye has cells that report to a part of the brain that controls our sleep rhythms over a 24-hour cycle. itõs the light that controls it.óbut it isnõt just students who would bene t from a later start. kelley says the working day should be more linked to our natural rhythms. describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: òbetween 14 and 24, people lose more than two hours. for people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35, they lose about an hour and a half. that can continue up until youõre about 55 when itõs in balance again. the 10-year-old and 55-year-old wake and sleep naturally at the same time.óso, should workplaces have staggered starting times, too? should people in their 50s and above come in at 8am, people in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage apprentice at 11am? kelley says that synchronized hours could have òmany positive effects. the positive side is that peopleõs performance, mood and health will improve. itõs very positive because itõs a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.óthere would probably be fewer accidents because drivers would be more awake, he says. it could mean the end of rush hour because people would stagger their work times and the times of their school run. a later start to the day for many, says kelley, òis something that would bene t all people, particularly families. parents go and try to wake up teenagers who are waking up three hours too early. it creates problems for everybody.óso, what time does kelley start work? òi am 67 so that means iõm like a 10-year-old and i get up just after six. i wake naturally.ó and, yes, he says he  nds the start of his working day much easier now than when he was younger.
elementary	water scientists have given a very strong warning about the world’s food supplies. they say that everyone may have to change to a vegetarian diet by 2050.we believe there will be an extra two billion people in the world by 2050. humans get about 20% of their protein from animal-based products now, but this may need to decrease to just 5% to feed these extra people, say the world’s top water scientists.“there will not be enough water to produce food for the nine-billion population in 2050 if more people start eating like people in the west,” the report by malik falkenmark and colleagues at the stockholm international water institute (siwi) said.“there will be enough water if the percentage of animal-based foods is limited to 5% of total calories.”there are warnings that water shortages will limit food production. at the same time, oxfam and the un prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years. prices for food items such as corn and wheat have increased nearly 50% on international markets since june. the price increase has been caused by very bad droughts in the us and russia, and weak monsoon rains in asia. more than 18 million people already have serious food shortages across the sahel.oxfam says that the effects of price increases will be very bad in developing countries that need to buy food from other countries, including parts of latin america, north africa and the middle east. food shortages in 2008 led to fighting in 28 countries.changing to a vegetarian diet is one way to keep more water to grow food, the scientists said. animal protein-rich food uses five to ten times more water than vegetarian food. one third of the world’s farmland is used to grow crops to feed animals.“nine hundred million people already don’t have enough food and two million people are malnourished, even though we are producing more food,” they said. “70% of all water is used in farming, and growing more food to feed an extra two billion people by 2050 will put more pressure on water and land.”the report was released at the start of the annual world water conference in stockholm, sweden, where 2,500 politicians, un groups, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries met to discuss global water supply problems.eating too much, malnourishment and waste are all increasing. “we will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future,” said the report’s editor, anders jägerskog.nannannannannan
advanced	tigers are more numerous in nepal than at any time since the 1970s, a new census has revealed, giving conservationists hope that the big cats, whose numbers have been dropping across south asia for 100 years, can be saved.the number of wild royal bengal tigers in nepal has increased to 198 – a 63.6% rise in five years – the government survey showed. “this is very encouraging,” said maheshwar dhakal, an ecologist with nepal’s department of national parks and wildlife conservation.the census is based on the examination of pictures from more than 500 cameras placed in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors. more than 250 conservationists and wildlife experts worked on the survey, which cost about £250,000. dhakal said that a parallel survey was conducted in india and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013. “it will take a few more months for india, which now has 1,300 big cats in several huge protected areas, to finalize the data,” he added. nepal has pledged to double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 when the last systematic tiger count took place.increasing prosperity in asia has pushed up prices for tiger skins and the body parts used in traditional chinese medicines. international gangs pay poor local nepali significant sums to kill the cats. the skin and bones are handed to middlemen, who pass easily through the porous border to india, where the major dealers are based.one major problem is complicity between senior officials and mafia networks involved in the trade. conservation experts credit the increase in numbers to the effective policing of national parks, stronger anti-poaching drives and better management of tiger habitats in nepal, where forests cover 29% of the land. but they say nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers prey so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat.as the number of tigers has increased over the years, so have incidents of conflict with villagers. seven people were killed in attacks by tigers around national parks in 2012 compared to four in 2011, park officials said. villagers are also seeking better protection. “the government is making conservation plans for tigers. but it should also come up with plans to protect people from tigers,” krishna bhurtel, a local village headman in chitwan, told nepali newspaper nagarik. wildlife authorities captured a tiger in chitwan after it killed two people, including a villager who was pulled from his bed in may.thousands of tigers once roamed the forests in bangladesh, india and nepal. but their numbers have dropped to about 3,000, a 95% drop over a century. chitwan national park in central nepal has the highest number of adult tigers, with 120, followed by bardiya national park (50) and shukla phanta wildlife reserve (17).diwakar chapagain, who heads a world wildlife fund nepal unit that monitors wildlife trade, said tiger skins were in demand in tibet, where well-heeled people use them as festival costumes.in nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins in front of stuffed tigers for special occasions. some affluent nepali have mounted tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms. tiger bones are in high demand for use in traditional chinese medicines. “the trade in tiger parts is lucrative and fetches thousands of dollars in illegal markets,” chapagain said, highlighting the threat tigers face.
advanced	margaret thatcher, the most dominant british prime minister since winston churchill in 1940 and a global champion of the late 20th-century free market economic revival, has died. the british government announced that she would receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours at st paul’s cathedral.the british prime minister, david cameron, who is cutting short his trip to europe to return to london following the news, said: “it was with great sadness that l learned of lady thatcher’s death. we’ve lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great briton.” he added: “as our first woman prime minister, margaret thatcher succeeded against all the odds, and the real thing about margaret thatcher is that she didn’t just lead our country, she saved our country, and i believe she will go down as the greatest british peacetime prime minister.”in a statement, president barack obama said, “here in america, many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with president reagan, reminding the world that we are not simply carried along by the currents of history – we can shape them with moral conviction, unyielding courage and iron will.”the first woman elected to lead a major western state, lady thatcher, as she became after the longest premiership since 1827, served 11 unbroken years at no 10 downing street.thatcher, who was 87, had been in declining health for some years, suffering from dementia. after a series of mini-strokes in 2002, thatcher withdrew from public life, no longer able to make the kind of waspish pronouncements that had been her forte in office – and beyond.her death was greeted with tributes from across the political spectrum.as labour sources announced the party would suspend campaigning in local elections as a mark of respect, its leader, ed miliband, said: “she will be remembered as a unique figure. she reshaped the politics of a whole generation. she was britain’s first woman prime minister. she moved the centre ground of british politics and was a huge figure on the world stage. the labour party disagreed with much of what she did and she will always remain a controversial figure. but we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength.”the deputy prime minister, nick clegg, said: “margaret thatcher was one of the defining figures in modern british politics. whatever side of the political debate you stand on, no one can deny that as prime minister she left a unique and lasting imprint on the country she served.”describing her as a political phenomenon, the former tory prime minister sir john major said: “her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.”the “iron lady” proved a significant cold war ally of the us president ronald reagan in the final showdown with the soviet union, which broke up under reformist pressures led by mikhail gorbachev, a kremlin leader with whom thatcher famously declared she could “do business”. as a result, many ordinary voters in ex-soviet bloc states saw her as a bold champion of their liberty, a view widely shared across the spectrum of mainstream us opinion – though not at home or among key eu partners.thatcher was an unremarkable mid-ranking conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975. within a decade, she had become known around the world – both admired and detested – for her pro-market domestic reforms and her implacable attitudes in foreign policy, including her long-running battle with the ira, which almost managed to murder her when it placed a bomb in the grand hotel, brighton, in 1984.at home, the emerging doctrine of thatcherism meant denationalization of state-owned industry – the new word “privatization” came into widespread use in many countries – and defeat of militant trade unionists, notably the national union of miners, whose year-long strike (1984– 85) was bitter and traumatic.boosted by the newly arrived revenues from britain’s north sea oil fields, thatcher had room to manoeuvre and change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies – including moderate members of her own party.but she also deployed her notorious “handbaggings”, or verbal attacks, in the european union to obtain a british rebate – “my money” as she called it. she was less successful in fending off the centralizing ambitions of the “belgian empire”, her description of the european commission, especially in the years when it was headed by the french socialist jacques delors.her allies in the tabloid press egged her on. and, as the british economy recovered from the severe recession that her monetarist medicine had inflicted on it – to tame the unions and cure inflation – she briefly seemed invincible.but untrammelled power, with the defeat or retirement of allies who had kept her in check, led to mistakes and growing unpopularity. when sir geoffrey howe, nominally her deputy, finally fell out with thatcher – chiefly over europe – his devastating resignation speech triggered a leadership challenge. thatcher made way for john major rather than risk losing to him in a ballot.in retirement, she wrote highly successful memoirs in two volumes and campaigned energetically on behalf of the thatcher foundation, which sought to promote her values around the world.
advanced	europe is to become the first place in the world to force ‘real-world’ emissions tests on car makers, opening up a new front in the fight to tackle air pollution. new regulations will introduce the tests to reveal what cars’ emissions are like when driving on roads and in traffic rather than in ideal, laboratory-like conditions, as is currently the case.green lit by european commission vice president, frans timmermans, the tests are designed to enforce a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre, a level met by only one car out of 16, according to researchers. other countries, such as china and korea, which are also considering real-world emissions tests, will be watching what happens next closely.pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and particulates are thought to be responsible for at least one quarter of the 29,000 annual pollution-related deaths in the uk alone. that figure is likely to rise, when the committee on the medical effects of air pollutants publishes what it calls “strengthening evidence” of damage to public health from nitrogen oxide emissions later in 2015.but the current ‘new european drive cycle’ laboratory test for measuring these emissions is a quarter of a century old and has been outpaced by technological developments in the car industry. studies have shown that the results of lab techniques to measure car emissions can easily be fixed by using techniques such as taping up doors and windows to minimize air resistance, driving on unrealistically smooth roads and testing at improbably high temperatures. campaigners say that car makers also use tricks such as programming vehicles to go into a low emissions mode when their front wheels are spinning and their back wheels are stationary, as happens in such lab experiments.“the commission is finalizing a proposal to introduce a new emissions testing procedure that will allow proper assessment of the vehicles in real driving,” said lucia caudet, a commission spokesperson. the proposal still needs approval from other commissioners and a technical committee but “we don’t expect any major internal hurdles,” a european union (eu) source added.“one key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 citizens annually is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars, causing many times more pollution on the road,” said greg archer, the clean vehicles manager for transport and environment. “the development of a new, real-world driving emission test is an important step forward in tackling urban air pollution. eu states should now support the commission’s proposals and ignore the whingeing from car makers that the rules are too tough.”according to research by the international council on clean transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg/km standard, with some models running at 22 times above the recommended limit. only one car out of 16 met the 80g target. around one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport – mostly diesel – and, in urban areas, concentrations can rise as high as 64%, european environment agency figures indicate.campaigners say that the car industry has tried to delay reforms to car test cycles but industry groups deny this, arguing that a five-year lead-time is necessary for technical and economic reasons. “real driving emissions (rde) is a totally new regulation that will force significant emission control hardware changes that may be demanded in the middle of a vehicle’s production lifetime,” said cara mclaughlin, a spokesperson for the european automobile manufacturers association (acea). “however, acea fully accepts that rde will apply to new types of cars from september 2017.”in an unusual move, the car association sent timmermans a draft regulation of their own for him to consider, after eu representatives finally agreed a regulation to implement the nitrogen oxide limits with beefed-up road trials and strict monitoring of exhaust fumes. acea’s draft regulation would have covered fewer pollutants and further delayed the regulation’s phased introduction until 2020. test distances would have been shortened from 1,300m to below 700m, minimum temperatures would have been raised from -7c to -3c and more rural roads would have been used. “the lobbyists were all over this,” archer said. “this was a real attempt at subversion of the legislative process.”after timmerman’s apparent rejection of the acea proposal, the regulation will now pass to commissioners for a rubber stamp, and member states for final amendments, before an expected introduction in september. by 2017, the first real-world car emissions tests are expected to begin in earnest. with a similar battle already looming over the testing of co2 emissions for cars at the end of 2015 – and with comparable debates in other countries – the introduction of the eu’s new emissions tests will be watched closely.
advanced	seaworld has suffered an 84% collapse in pro ts as customers have deserted the controversial aquatic theme park company following claims it mistreated orca whales.the company, which trains dolphins and killer whales to perform tricks in front of stadiums full of spectators, has reported declines in attendance, sales and pro ts because of òcontinued brand challengesó.seaworld has been in the headlines since the 2013 documentary black sh detailed claims that its treatment of orca whales provoked violent behaviour, contributing to the deaths of three people. following the release of the documentary, attendance collapsed, the company lost more than half of its market value on wall street and its former ceo was forced out.the company has since launched a nationwide marketing campaign to combat animal rights activists claims that, among other things, captive orcas die at a younger age than their wild counterparts.despite cutting ticket prices and spending $10m on the marketing blitz, which features its veterinarians caring for whales, seaworld ceo joel manby was forced to admit that the company is still struggling to convince the public that it treats its whales well.òwe realize we have much work ahead of us to recover more of our attendance base, increase revenue and improve our performance, as returning to historical performance levels will take time and investment,ó manby said. òon the reputation side, early feedback on our campaign has been positive. however, we recognize that fully resolving our brand challenges in california will require sustained focus and commitment to correct misinformation.óòwe will continue to  ght with the facts because the facts are on our side,ó he said recently on a conference call with journalists and analysts. manby, who joined the company as ceo in 2015 to help the company rehabilitate itself, said he would set out his vision for the future of the company at a special event on 6 november.already in the pipeline are plans for a new shark exhibition in orlando and an attraction in san antonio that will allow customers to swim with dolphins in a ònaturalisticó setting.the companyõs  nancial report, released on 6 august, showed net income in the second quarter dropped from $37.4m in 2014 to $5.8m in 2015, an 84% decrease. revenue fell from $405m to $392m. attendance dropped by more than 100,000 from 6.58 million to 6.48 million.analysts will now be closely watching seaworldõs sales and attendance numbers in the third quarter, which is traditionally the companyõs most pro table and covers the summer holiday season. attendance may suffer from a fresh scandal in july 2015, in which a seaworld employee was alleged to have in ltrated animal rights protest groups against the company.jared goodman, director of animal law for people for the ethical treatment of animals (peta), which has been leading campaigns against seaworld, said: òseaworld is in the midst of a spying scandal, animals are dying in its tanks and tens of thousands of people have opposed its bid to build a new orca prison so it should come as no surprise that seaworldõs quarterly earnings have plummeted yet again in the second quarter. families just donõt want to buy tickets to see orcas going insane inside tiny tanks and seaworldõs pro ts, like the orcas, wonõt recover until the abusement park empties its tanks and builds coastal sanctuaries.óseaworldõs shares, which were worth $39 in 2013, were changing hands for just under $18 in august 2015.
advanced	they are the darkness seekers – and they are growing in number. on black fell, looking down on northumberland’s beautiful kielder water reservoir, a group of people wait in a car park next to a strange wooden building with a minimalist design beamed down from the future. this is kielder observatory, the centre of britain’s nascent astrotourism industry. and those waiting outside were the lucky ones. many more had applied for a night of stargazing at the observatory but numbers are strictly limited.inside, next to a woodburner and under dimmed lights, the observatory’s founder and lead astronomer, gary fildes, a former bricklayer with tarzan hair, delivers a pep talk to his colleagues and volunteers. the team discusses the prospect of seeing the northern lights but fildes is doubtful. instead, they decide to train their powerful telescopes on jupiter and venus and later to pick out stars such as capella and betelgeuse. an additional attraction is the appearance of the international space station.“remember,” fildes tells his team, “it’s about interaction, it’s about entertainment, it’s about inspiring people.” he puts on some music. pink floyd, the jam, the pogues. “by 9.30, the sky is going to be sexy,” fildes says. “it’s going to be epic.”fildes, 49, is at the forefront of the uk’s burgeoning astrotourism industry. the pivotal moment for northumberland came in 2013 when the entire national park housing hadrian’s wall, along with kielder water and forest park, some 1,500 sq km, was awarded dark sky park status, the only one in england. dark sky parks are rare. the 2013 star count revealed that only 5% of the uk population can see more than 31 stars on a good night.the tucson, arizona-based international dark-sky association (ida) confers the status only on places that take major steps to avoid light pollution. recipients must also prove their night skies are sufficiently dark. in northumberland dark sky park, as the area was rebadged, it is so dark that venus casts a shadow on the earth.duncan wise, visitor development officer for the northumberland national park authority, helped to spearhead the campaign for dark-sky status after the council for the protection of rural england found it was one of britain’s most tranquil places. “we tend to look at landscape as everything up to the horizon,” wise said. “but what about what’s above it?” wise and others spent years drawing up their submission to the ida, collecting reams of light readings and forming an alliance of local councils, parks’ bodies and community groups to produce an exterior lighting master plan that influences the construction of new developments in the area.their efforts have been vindicated. many of the 1.5 million who visit northumberland each year are now aware of its dark sky status. “we get a lot of people coming here to see the sky now,” says the man at the car-hire firm in newcastle. “they come in autumn and winter, when it’s darkest. good for the b&bs as they get business all year round now.” local hoteliers now issue guests with night-vision torches and put out deckchairs at night. those who have acquired some knowledge of astronomy can receive a badge confirming that their hotels are “dark sky friendly”.wise acknowledges that northumberland needs to do more to capitalize on its scarce resource and believes the region needs a couple more observatories to ensure that visitors will see what they came for. a £14m national landscape discovery centre, which he describes as the north’s answer to the eden project, will have an observatory when it is completed in a couple of years.fildes has grand designs. he is planning britain’s first “astrovillage”, one that would house the largest public observatory in the world and boast a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, a one-metre aperture telescope, and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes. the multimillion-pound project would feature a hotel and draw in 100,000 people a year, four times the number currently able to use the observatory. fildes is cryptic about his backers but believes the astrovillage will be a reality by 2018.however, northumberland faces competition. galloway forest park in scotland also has dark sky park status. since exmoor was designated europe’s first international dark sky reserve – one notch below dark sky park – in 2011, a range of local businesses offering stargazing breaks and safaris has sprung up. the uk will have to go some way to eclipse northern chile, which boasts more than a dozen tourist observatories and has some of the clearest skies in the world. the teide national park in tenerife is also becoming a major astrotourism destination.so, what is driving the desire to look upwards? the media have helped. tv presenters like brian cox have attracted a new generation of stargazers. “brian cox has made astronomy accessible,” says wise. “it’s no longer seen as the province of professors in studies with brass telescopes.” technology has also played a part. apps such as stellarium now turn smartphones into pocket-size planetariums. ultimately, though, fildes believes people are starting to appreciate what lies above. “if you had to build a visitor attraction from scratch, what could be better than the universe?”
advanced	we may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm back to the future ii, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched. experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally altering the transportation landscape. òitõs a very dynamic time,ó said robert puentes, of the brookings institutionõs metropolitan policy program think- tank. òthereõs a focus on a tighter connection between the role of transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people.óas the average us commute lengthens and the countryõs infrastructure ages badly, cities across the us are being forced to rede ne what transportation is. increasingly, urban planners, transportation experts and scientists are realizing that old auto-centric models focused on easing traf c congestion arenõt enough to tackle issues like population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now, more than ever, an integral component of a cityõs larger sustainability efforts.big us cities like los angeles, seattle and chicago are working to make better use of their streets by adding more bus lanes, augmenting pedestrian walkways and expanding their rail options, while at the same time working with the private sector on advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment, essentially making transportation intelligent. òthe most sustainable places to live are those places that have multi-modal transport systems,ó puentes said. òyou canõt be a global competitive city if you donõt have a robust transportation network.óhere are three of the key trends that experts predict will shape the transportation industry over the coming years. connectivity the rise of ride-sharing services like uber and lyft ð essentially taxis booked at the click of a smartphone button ð and apps like waze, which uses real-time traf c data to  nd the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people get around and affecting the very way in which traf c moves through a city. communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era, according to allan clelland, an expert on transportation technology.according to a recent study from the uclaõs institute of transportation studies, vehicle travel has declined among millennials ð individuals born roughly between the early 1980s and early 2000s ð compared to previous generations. according to the study, those born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives.meanwhile, those still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to waze. experts say the traf c app has eased congestion on motorways and reduced travel times for drivers but also led to a problematic rise in cars moving through residential neighbourhoods. this has angered residents, who claim the increased traf c on their quiet roads reduces their quality of life.this trend could continue as vehicle-to-vehicle data communication, as well as communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure, grows. currently, a traf c light can detect when a car is approaching but thatõs about it. companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.automation driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. however, the partial automation of cars is already underway. alexandre bayen of the university of california expects automation will progress in stages:  rst, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: essentially, vehicles that are connected electronically and travel in single  le.the idea of a fully automated transportation system is intriguing because it has the potential to improve safety by removing human error and increase the ef ciency of car owners, who can get on with other tasks during a long commute. it can also help reduce carbon emissions and traf c congestion and allow more people access to cars. but, even if driverless technology were ready to hit the roads now, it would take a long time to get fully automated given the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.to see what driverless cars might look like in action, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.environmental concern as the world races to avoid catastrophic climate change, and countries, states and cities work to meet ambitious emissions goals, these policies could also have a big impact on the future of transportation, spurring everything from zero- and low-emission vehicles to apps that encourage more walking, biking and carpooling.sharon feigon, executive director of the shared use mobility center, envisages a future where a person can use a transit pass that gives them access to numerous modes of transport in a given day. if their train is delayed, for instance, they can access a city bike, take a shuttle or rent a vehicle through a car share programme using the same pass. òweõre going to see these systems packaged together and make it as easy as possible to connect them up with each other so people can transfer seamlessly between them,ó she said.when considering the future of transportation, itõs also important to keep in mind why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. technologies and trends that reduce the need for those trips ð say, virtual meetings or telecommuting ð could also have a big impact on transportation.there was a time when the idea of a  ying car represented the height of innovation but the technologies being imagined and developed now could be seen as even more sophisticated ð and more useful in tackling the social and environmental threats that we face over the coming decades.ó
advanced	jmw turner, one of britain’s greatest painters, is to be the face of the new £20 note, following a nationwide vote.it will be the first time an artist has appeared on a british banknote, after the governor of the bank of england, mark carney, asked the public to nominate a deceased cultural figure they felt deserved the high honour.turner, renowned for his dramatic seascapes, beat off competition from 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, film-makers and actors put forward by 30,000 members of the public.the list included alfred hitchcock, alexander mcqueen, derek jarman, laura ashley, william morris and vanessa bell, which was then narrowed down by a panel of artists, critics and historians to a final choice of five.the final five – barbara hepworth, charlie chaplin, josiah wedgwood, william hogarth and turner – were selected on the basis of their “unquestioned” contribution to both the visual arts and british society as a whole, as well as their enduring influence.fittingly, the announcement of the new banknote was made at the turner contemporary gallery in margate, which stands on the former site of mrs booth’s lodging house, where turner would always stay when he visited. the announcement was made jointly by carney and the artist tracey emin, who grew up in the town.carney said it had been “so important to get this right and have a proper process that involved the public,” adding that, far from banknotes being purely a practical necessity, “if done properly, they can be a piece of art in everyone’s pocket”.“money is memory for a country and its people,” said the bank of england governor. “banknotes of the bank of england are a celebration of the uk’s heritage, a salute to its culture, a testament to its great achievements, including those of its most notable citizens. in short, money has not just economic value, it has cultural value as well.“the fact that we will have turner on the £20 note shows now that the british people are a nation of people who appreciate creativity and appreciate the arts,” said emin.the note will feature turner’s 1799 self-portrait, which currently hangs in tate britain, as well as one of his most recognizable works, the fighting temeraire, a tribute to the ship that played a distinguished role in nelson’s victory at the battle of trafalgar in 1805.emblazoned on the note will also be a quote from the artist – “light is therefore colour” – as well as his signature, taken from his will, in which he bequeathed many of his works to the nation.the new £20 note, which replaces the one featuring social philosopher and economic theorist adam smith, will enter circulation by 2020. this is the first time the public have been given a say over whose face appears on a british banknote.carney overhauled the process in 2013, following a high-profile campaign to ensure that women, apart from the queen, remained on banknotes, after the bank decided to phase out the elizabeth fry £5 note.historical figures were first introduced onto banknotes in 1970. turner joins winston churchill and jane austen as the significant figures who will feature on the new polymer notes – a plastic-type material that the new notes will all be made from – churchill on the £5 and austen on the £10 note. following in the footsteps of florence nightingale and elizabeth fry, the pride and prejudice author is only the third woman to be the face of british currency.turner was born in 1775 in london, the son of a barber, and he entered the royal academy schools at the age of 14. it was 1786, when he was sent to margate, that his love affair with painting and drawing the north-east kent coast began. he would return to that coast throughout his life and it was where he painted some of his most dramatic oils and watercolours, describing its skies as “the loveliest in all europe”.turner was a particularly prolific artist, producing more than 550 oil paintings and 2,000 watercolours over his lifetime. his life was also the subject of a film, in 2014, by mike leigh, with timothy spall taking on the role of the complex artist.victoria pomery, the director of turner contemporary, said: “the decision to celebrate jmw turner, one of the greatest technical pioneers in the history of british art, is extraordinary, not least because it has proven by a public vote that turner is the nation’s favourite artist. brilliantly, it is an official acknowledgment of the immense historical value of the visual arts to the uk.“but it is also a stark reminder that we must place increasing value on our future as a nation of creative minds. we must invest to support the next great artists and innovators.”
advanced	vienna is the worldõs best city to live in, baghdad is the worst and london, paris and new york do not even make it into the top 35, according to international research into quality of life.german-speaking cities dominate the rankings in the 18th mercer quality of life study, with vienna joined by zurich, munich, dusseldorf and frankfurt in the top seven.paris has tumbled down the league, falling ten places to 37th, just ahead of london at 39th, almost entirely because of the cityõs vulnerability to terrorist attacks.the study examined social and economic conditions, health, education, housing and the environment, and is used by big companies to assess where they should locate and how much they should pay staff.viennese-born helena hartlauer, 32, said she was not surprised at her cityõs top position. the municipalityõs social democratic government has a long tradition of investing in high-quality social housing, making vienna almost uniquely affordable among major cities.òi live in a 100sq-metre turn-of-the-century apartment in a good area about 20 minutesõ walk from the city centre. but my rent is just û800 (£625) a month.ó an equivalent apartment in london would cost upwards of £2,000 and even more in new york, ranked 44th in the table.us cities perform relatively poorly in the study, largely because of issues around personal safety and crime. the highest ranking city in the us is san francisco, at 28th; boston is 34th. canadian cities, led by vancouver, far outrank their us rivals in the table.òyou donõt realize how safe vienna is until you head abroad,ó said hartlauer. òwe also have terri c public transport, with the underground working 24 hours at weekends, and it only costs û1 per trip.óvienna bene ted enormously from the fall of the berlin wall, becoming the gateway to eastern european countries that often have historic ties to the former austro-hungarian empire.òour big usp is our geographical location,ó said martin eichtinger, austrian ambassdaor to london, who lived in vienna for 20 years. òthe fall of the berlin wall helped de ne vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in central europe.óaccording to the world bank, austria has one of the highest  gures for gdp per head in the world, just behind the us and ahead of germany and britain, although quite some way below neighbouring switzerland.zurich in switzerland is named by mercer as having the worldõs second highest quality of life but the viennese say their city is far more fun. òthere are more students in vienna than any other german-speaking city,ó said hartlauer. òitõs a very fast growing, young and lively city,ó she added ð though she conceded she works for the cityõs tourist board.vienna has long been overlooked by british weekend city break tourists, who instead  ock to barcelona or berlin and tend to think of austria as somewhere for skiing, lakes and mountains.but, after an increase in budget  ights from regional british cities such as manchester and edinburgh, vienna is fast catching up as a popular destination. in 2015, there were 588,000 british visitors to vienna, up 18% on the year before. the  ow is both ways; eichtinger said london has become the number one city destination for austrian visitors.òvienna has ranked top in the last seven published rankings,ó said mercer. òit scores highly in a number of categories; it provides a safe and stable environment to live in, a high level of public utilities and transport facilities and good recreational facilities.óthe european migrant crisis, which has seen large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers pass through vienna en route to germany, has had little impact on the city of nearly 1.8 million people, said eichtinger. òwe have managed to accommodate 90,000 refugees in austria but the numbers have slowed in recent months.ólondon has never been in the quality-of-life top ten, says mercer, damaged by its poor scores for air pollution, traf c congestion and climate. after london, edinburgh is the next-ranking british city, in 46th place.paris has suffered the biggest fall in the most recent rankings. òparis remained stable for several years but has, this year, dropped ten places in the overall ranking,ó said mercer.òthe drop was essentially due to the terrorist attacks in 2015. however, it is important to highlight that safety issues are a very highly weighted factor within the ôbasketõ so any small adjustments can have a big impact on the ranking.óauckland in new zealand was the highest ranking english-speaking city in the survey, in third place, followed by vancouver in  fth. australian cities also perform very highly in the survey, with sydney 10th and melbourne 15th. the economist has consistently ranked melbourne as the worldõs most liveable city, although its survey has been criticized as too anglocentric.war and political unrest are behind all the worst-ranked cities in the world. surprisingly, damascus is named as only the seventh worst, ranked better than not just baghdad but also bangui in central african republic, sanaõa in yemen, port-au-prince in haiti, khartoum in sudan and nõdjamena in chad.
advanced	the mass collection of telephone records by government surveillance programmes poses a clear threat to the personal privacy of ordinary citizens, according to us researchers who used basic phone logs to identify people and uncover confidential information about their lives.armed with anonymous “metadata” on people’s calls and texts, but not the content of the communications, two scientists at stanford university worked out individuals’ names, where they lived and the names of their partners. but that was not all.the same data led them to uncover potentially sensitive information about some individuals. one man was found to own a rifle, while another had recently been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. other data pointed to a new pregnancy and a person with multiple sclerosis.the results highlight the extraordinary power of telephone metadata – the number called, when and for how long – particularly when it is paired with public information available from services such as google, yelp and facebook. the value of the data, which is not subject to the same legal protections as the content of people’s communications, has long been recognized by the security services. as stewart baker, the former general counsel at the us national security agency (nsa), put it in the aftermath of edward snowden’s revelations: “metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody’s life.”patrick mutchler, a computer security researcher at stanford, said that while the power of metadata was understood by those gathering the information, the public was largely in the dark because so few published studies have revealed how rich the data is. “that makes it difficult for people with strong opinions about these programmes to fight them. now, we have hard evidence we can point to that didn’t exist in the past,” he said.for the study, the researchers signed up 823 people who agreed to have metadata collected from their phones through an android app. the app also received information from their facebook accounts, which the scientists used to check the accuracy of their results. in all, the researchers gathered metadata on more than 250,000 calls and over 1.2m texts.analysts who logged into the nsa’s metadata-gathering system were initially allowed to examine data up to three hops away from an individual. a call from the target individual’s phone to another number was one hop. from that phone to another was two hops. and so on. the records available to analysts stretched back for five years. the collection window has now been restricted to two hops and 18 months at most.writing in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences, mutchler describes how, on a shoestring budget, he and fellow graduate student, jonathan mayer, uncovered a wealth of personal information, some of it sensitive, about people who took part in the study. through automatic and manual searches, they identified 82% of people’s names. the same technique gave them the names of businesses the people had called. when these were plotted on a map, they revealed clusters of local businesses, which the scientists speculated surrounded the person’s home address. in this way, they named the city people lived in 57% of the time, and were nearly 90% accurate in placing people within 50 miles of their home. mutchler believes some of the misses came from people not updating their facebook page when they moved out of their parents’ home, for example, to go to college.the scientists next delved into more personal territory. using a simple computer program to analyse people’s call patterns, they inferred who among the study volunteers was in a relationship. once they knew the owner of a particular number had a partner, identifying the significant other was easy, they report.for the final part of the study, the researchers delved even deeper, to see what sensitive information they could glean from telephone metadata. they gathered details on calls made to and from a list of organizations, including hospitals, pharmacies, religious groups, legal services, firearms retailers and repair firms. from these, they pieced together some extraordinary vignettes from people’s lives.the metadata from one person in the study showed they had a long call from a cardiology centre, spoke briefly with a medical laboratory, answered a number of short calls from a local pharmacy and then made calls to a hotline for abnormal heart-rate monitoring devices. another participant made frequent calls to a local gun supplier that specialized in semiautomatic rifles and later placed a number of long calls to the customer support hotline run by a major gun manufacturer that produced the rifles. the metadata from two others suggested one had multiple sclerosis and the other had just become pregnant.“all of this should be taken as an indication of what is possible with two graduate students and limited resources,” said mutchler, who argues that the findings should make policymakers think twice before authorizing mass surveillance programmes. “large-scale metadata surveillance programmes, like the nsa’s, will necessarily expose highly confidential information about ordinary citizens,” the scientists write, adding: “to strike an appropriate balance between national security and civil liberties, future policymaking must be informed by input from relevant sciences.”ross anderson, professor of security engineering at cambridge university, said the study provided numbers that discussions can now be based on. “with the right analytics running over nationscale communications data, you can infer huge amounts of sensitive information on everyone. we always suspected that, of course, but here’s the data.”
advanced	not just the identity of the man in the car park with the twisted spine, but the appalling last moments and humiliating treatment of the naked body of richard iii in the hours after his death have been revealed at an extraordinary press conference at leicester university.there were cheers when richard buckley, lead archaeologist on the hunt for the king’s body, finally announced that the university team was convinced “beyond reasonable doubt” that it had found the last plantagenet king, bent by scoliosis of the spine, and twisted further to fit into a hastily dug hole in grey friars church, which was slightly too small to hold his body.but, by then, it was clear the evidence was overwhelming, as the scientists who carried out the dna tests, those who created the computer-imaging technology to peer onto and into the bones in extraordinary detail, the genealogists who found a distant descendant with matching dna, and the academics who scoured contemporary texts for accounts of the king’s death and burial outlined their findings.“what a morning. what a story,” said philippa langley, of the richard iii society. she had been driving on the project for years, in the face of incredulity from many people, and finding funds from all over the world when it looked as if the money would run out before the excavation had even begun.work has started on designing a new tomb in leicester cathedral, only 100 yards from the excavation site, and a ceremony will be held to lay him into his new grave there, probably next year. leicester’s museums’ service is working on plans for a new visitor centre in an old school building overlooking the site.richard died at bosworth on 22 august 1485, the last english king to fall in battle, and the researchers revealed how for the first time. there was an audible intake of breath as a slide came up showing the base of his skull sliced off by one terrible blow, believed to be from a halberd, a fearsome medieval battle weapon with a razor-sharp iron axe blade weighing about two kilos, mounted on a wooden pole, which was swung at richard at very close range. the blade probably penetrated several centimetres into his brain and, said the human bones expert jo appleby, he would have been unconscious at once and dead almost as soon.the injury appears to confirm contemporary accounts that he died in close combat in the thick of the battle and unhorsed – as in the great despairing cry shakespeare gives him: “a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!” another sword slash, which also went through the bone and into the brain, would also have proved fatal. but many of the other injuries were after death, suggesting a gruesome ritual on the battlefield and as the king’s body was brought back to leicester, as he was stripped, mocked and mutilated.one terrible injury, a stab through the right buttock and into his pelvis, was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour. it suggests the story that his naked corpse was brought back slung over a horse, mocked and abused all the way, is true. bob savage, a medieval arms expert from the royal armouries who helped identify the wounds, said it was probably not a war weapon but the sort of sharp knife or dagger any workman might have carried.michael ibsen, the canadian-born furniture maker proved to be the descendant of richard’s sister, heard the confirmation on sunday and listened to the unfolding evidence in shocked silence. “my head is no clearer now than when i first heard the news,” he said. “many, many hundreds of people died on that field that day. he was a king, but just one of the dead. he lived in very violent times and these deaths would not have been pretty or quick.”it was mathew morris who first uncovered the body, in the first hour of the first day of the excavation. he did not believe he had found the king. the mechanical digger was still chewing the tarmac off the council car park, identified by years of research by local historians and the richard iii society as the probable site of the lost church of grey friars, whose priests bravely claimed the body of the king and buried him in a hastily dug grave, probably still naked, but in a position of honour near the high altar of their church. the leg bones just showing through the soil were covered up again.ten days later, on 5 september, when further excavation proved morris had hit the crucial spot, he returned with lin foxhall, head of the archaeology department, to excavate the body. “we did it the usual way, lifting the arms, legs and skull first, and proceeding gradually towards the torso – so it was only when we finally saw the twisted spine that i thought: ‘my word, i think we’ve got him.’”as far as langley is concerned, richard was the true king, the last king of the north, a worthy and brave leader who became a victim of some of the most brilliant propaganda in history, in the hands of the tudors’ imagemaker, shakespeare. there remains the dark shadow of the little princes in the tower, an infamous story even in richard’s day: the child edward v and his brother richard were declared illegitimate when richard iii claimed the throne, imprisoned in the tower of london and never seen alive again. although it is by no means certain that the bones found at the tower centuries later are theirs, there may be more dna detective work to be done there.
