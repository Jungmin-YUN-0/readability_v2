intermediate	the uk prime minister, david cameron, has declared a òclear resultó in the scottish independence referendum ð scotland voted by a 10.6-point margin against ending the 307-year- old union with england and wales. the prime minister promised a devolution revolution in great britain, as he welcomed scotlandõs decision to remain inside the uk. òthere can be no disputes, no reruns ð we have heard the will of the scottish people,ó he said in a statement.earlier, scotlandõs  rst minister, alex salmond, remained de ant at a scottish national party rally in edinburgh ð he said he accepted scotland had not, òat this stageó, decided to vote for independence. he said the referendum was a òtriumph for democratic politicsó and he would work with the government in london in the best interests of scotland and the rest of the uk. òwe have touched sections of the community who have never before been touched by politics,ó he said.the yes campaign won four big successes ð it won 53% of the vote in scotlandõs largest city, glasgow, 57% in dundee and 51% in north lanarkshire. however, the no campaign was victorious in 28 authorities. it won easily in areas where it was expected to do well, including edinburgh, aberdeenshire and borders, but also in areas that could have gone to the yes campaign, including the western isles. in the  nal count, the no camp won 2,001,926 votes (55.3%) and the yes camp won 1,617,989 votes (44.7%).in his speech, cameron made clear that there would be constitutional reforms, including in scotland, but not until after the general election. he also said that scottish measures would happen in tandem with changes in england. òwe have heard the voice of scotland and, now, the millions of voices of england must be heard,ó he said.cameron added: òthe people of scotland have spoken and it is a clear result. they have kept our country of four nations together and, like millions of other people, i am delighted. as i said during the campaign, it would have broken my heart to see our united kingdom come to an end. and i know that feeling was shared by people not just across our country but around the world because of what we have achieved together in the past and what we can do together in the future. so, now, it is time for our united kingdom to come together and to move forward. a vital part of that will be a balanced settlement, fair to people in scotland and, importantly, to everyone in england, wales and northern ireland as well.ed miliband, the leader of the labour party, said the referendum was a vote from the scottish people for change. òwe know our country needs to change. we will deliver stronger powers for a stronger scottish parliament, a strong scotland.ó but he said that would go beyond scotland. òwe will also meet the desire for change across england, across wales, across the whole of the united kingdom.ónick clegg, the deputy prime minister, said the referendum was ònot only a new chapter for scotland within the uk but also wider constitutional reform across the unionó. he said a vote against independence was ònot a vote against changeó. òwe must now deliver on time and in full the radical package of newly devolved powers to scotland,ó he added.yet that result raises the risk of further problems ð mps from cameronõs conservative party are threatening to vote against the prime ministerõs promise to quickly increase the scottish parliamentõs powers and protect its spending.the uk independence party leader, nigel farage, said cameronõs offer of more devolution for england did not go far enough. òthe english are 86% by population of this union. theyõve been left out of all of this for the last 18 years. we still have a situation where scottish mps can vote in the house of commons on english-only issues. i think what most english people want is a fair settlement,ó he said. cameron will try to calm tensions when he makes another statement on the result. the prime minister will explain how he will deliver further devolution to scotland, including giving greater powers over tax and welfare to the scottish parliament in edinburgh. the prime minister wants to move fast to show that the three main uk party leaders will meet the commitments they made during the referendum campaign.for the no campaign, there was relief: a number of opinion polls in the  nal days of the campaign had said the vote was on a knife-edge. this brought yes scotland within touching distance of victory after a dramatic surge in support.nannan
intermediate	chemists have waited a long time for a new element to turn up and, now, four have been discovered by researchers in japan, russia and the us. the four new elements are the first to be added to the periodic table since 2011, when elements 114 and 116 were included. the new elements, all highly radioactive, complete seventh row of the periodic table and mean that science textbooks around the world are now out of date.the us-based international union of pure and applied chemistry (iupac), the global organization that controls chemical names, terminology and measurement, verified the elements on 30 december, 2015 after examining studies dating back to 2004. the scientists who found them must now come up with formal names to replace the latin-based temporary names – ununtrium, ununpentium, ununseptium and ununoctium – which reflect their atomic numbers, 113, 115, 117, and 118. the atomic number is the number of protons found in an element’s atomic nucleus.iupac announced that a russian-american team of scientists at the joint institute for nuclear research in dubna and lawrence livermore national laboratory in california had produced enough evidence to claim the discovery of elements 115, 117 and 118. the organization gave credit for the discovery of element 113, which had also been claimed by the russians and americans, to a team of scientists from the riken institute in japan. the decision means japan becomes the first asian country to name an element. under iupac rules, new elements can be named after mythological concepts, minerals, a place or country, or a scientist.when elements 114 and 116 were given formal names in 2012, scientists chose flerovium and livermorium respectively, after the flerov lab at dubna’s joint institute of research and the lawrence livermore lab in the us, where the elements were discovered. kosuke morita, who led the research at riken, said his team now planned to “look to the uncharted territory of element 119 and beyond”. jan reedijk of iupac, said: “the chemistry community is eager to see the table finally completed down to the seventh row.”the japanese team is considering three names for ununtrium: japonium, rikenium and nishinarium, after the nishina center for accelerator-based science, where the element was found. “they have been thinking about it for a while already,” said polly arnold, professor of chemistry at edinburgh university. “this is painstaking work. the work helps us with our models and with understanding radioactive decay. if we understand it better, hopefully we can improve how we deal with nuclear waste and things that are important in the real world. it also leads to fantastic technological advances in building the kit to make these observations.”along with new names, the scientists must suggest two-letter symbols for the elements. when iupac has received the researchers’ suggestions, they will go to public review for five months. that allows scientists and others to raise any objections. in 1996, the symbol cp was suggested for copernicium, or element 112, but it was changed to cn when scientists complained that cp referred to another substance.to discover the elements, researchers at the three labs slammed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for radioactive decays that should come from the new elements. ununtrium and ununpentium are thought to be metals. ununseptium could be a metalloid. the fourth element, ununoctium, may be a gas, like other elements, helium, neon and argon. it is hard to know for sure because so few atoms of each element have ever been made.paul karol, chair of the iupac panel that verified the elements, said: “it will be a long time before we can find practical uses for the new elements.”
intermediate	a subway system has billions of inhabitants: the bacteria of swiss cheese and kimchi, bubonic plague and drug-proof bugs and human skin. now, for the  rst time, scientists have started to catalogue and map the bacteria in a cityõs subway ð and they have found many interesting results.dr christopher mason, a geneticist at weill cornell medical college, led a team that, for 18 months, tested the new york city subway system for the microscopic life forms that cover its turnstiles, seats, ticket booths and stations. his team found meningitis at times square, a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown manhattan.the team have strongly downplayed the  ndings of plague and anthrax. they say that there is only an extremely small trace of the latter, that rats likely carried the former and that no one has fallen ill with plague in or around new york for years.òthe results do not suggest that plague or anthrax is prevalent,ó the study says. ònor do they suggest that new york residents are at risk.óin fact, most of the bacteria identi ed by the team are either harmless to humans or bene cial in the cityõs thriving world of microorganisms.some of the results were expected and òshould be a gentle reminder for people to wash their handsó, mason said. he also said that they found many bacteria of the same sort as those òthat are bene cial and helpful, like the one used for making cheese.óbacteria appeared to re ect the eating habits of various neighbourhoods. all around the subway, bacteria associated with cheeses ð brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella found on new york pizza ð appeared. the distinctive bacteria of swiss cheese were more limited to midtown manhattan and the  nancial district, and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the  nancial district and bay ridge.bacteria associated with illness and infections were extremely common. species that cause diarrhoea and nausea, as well as e.coli, and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city. the species that produces tetanus appeared in soho and bacteria that cause dysentery appeared at a station in the bronx and another in harlem.mason and his team collected more than 1,000 samples at all of new yorkõs 466 open subway stations. they put the organic materials through a dna sequencer and, then, through a supercomputer. they identi ed 15,152 distinct species, nearly half of which were bacteria.the good news, the researchers said, is that these òpotentially infectious bacteriaó are not spreading sickness or disease throughout new york. they seem to be ònormal co-habitants of a cityó.in short, the researchers conclude, the subway and city are about as safe as everyone thought.mason said people should not be concerned about getting urinary-tract infections from subway seats. òyou should wash your hands,ó he said, òand probably get some sleep, eat salads and go to the gym, and thatõs about the same today as it was yesterday.óòin fact,ó he added, òiõve become much more con dent riding the subway.ómany  findings made sense: stations like grand central and times square, where there are more people, had more bacteria and more diversity among them. the bronx, with its diverse neighbourhoods and stations, had the greatest diversity of bacteria; staten island, with just three stops, had the lowest.the researchers found marine bacteria at south ferry, a station that  ooded during hurricane sandy ð but they were surprised to note the species included some normally associated with antarctica and  fish.the next steps, mason said, are studies of other cities, which have begun in paris, sa_o paolo and shanghai, and continued studies of new york, for instance to see how the results change with the seasons. he said he hoped the research would provide òa baselineó of research for health of cials and geneticists, and could help health of cials to prevent and track diseases and pathogens.
intermediate	brazil’s latest funk sensation, anitta, has won millions of fans by making the favela sound popular, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour.anti-discrimination campaigners and social commentators say the music industry’s fastest rising star has had to give up her blackness to be a success in the predominantly white middle-class market.the controversy began with the publication of then-and-now photographs that show a dramatic lightening of anitta’s skin tone since she signed a deal with warner.in the first photo, when she was quite unknown, she looked darker. in the second – a marketing photo after she became famous – she seems lighter. the contrast has restarted discussion about whether you need to have light skin to get ahead in brazil.jarid arraes, a psychology student and blogger, wrote a post criticizing the discrimination in media and marketing that she felt anitta’s image change represented. “people refuse to accept that they are racist and they think they live in a multiracial democracy, but the statistics show that is far from the case. white is the image of the rich, the nice, the successful, the good, while people see black as the opposite of all that.”born larissa de macedo machado, the diva-to-be was a church chorister in her childhood. in her teens, she made a name for herself in rio de janeiro’s baile funk scene as a dancer and singer.she now has an album and a huge hit single, show das poderosas, which topped the charts and attracted 52 million youtube views.many people love her because she is a pop idol with a strong message and some catchy tunes. her marketing team want people to see her as a cultural bridge between the predominantly black and mixed-race shanty towns on rio’s hillsides and the wealthier and whiter communities below.gangsta references and explicit lyrics of baile funk. now, however, questions are being asked about whether she – or her marketing team – have gone too far in changing her. arraes says that if pop stars have curly hair, they will want to straighten it. if they have a big nose, they will want to make it smaller. it creates a vicious cycle for how you feel about yourself.this is a sensitive topic in this largely mixed-raced nation. brazil – one of the last big countries in the world to ban slavery – has the largest population of african descent outside africa, but race and where your family come from are less important there than colour. there is a clear link between skin tone and inequality.in brazilian cities, white workers earn roughly twice as much as those of african descent. up until 2011, black or mixed-race students also spent two years less at school on average.most business and government executives are white, while most menial jobs are done by black and mixed-race workers. if you walk through ipanema, gávea or other rich districts, you are far more likely to see black nannies pushing strollers with white children than a white nanny pushing a black child.defining colour is complex. people who define themselves as white were in the minority for the first time in the most recent census in 2010. among the 197 million population, 82 million said they were “pardu” (mixed race), 15 million black, two million asian and 0.5% indigenous.sylvio ferreira, a psychology lecturer at the federal university of pernambuco, believes anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it more acceptable to everyone.maycon de mattos batista, a financial analyst who worked with anitta while she was an intern, said there had been a huge change in anitta’s image, but not of her colour.“i don’t believe it’s whitening; it’s more the way they are producing her with makeup, hairstylists and the way she dresses,” he said. “i don’t think that was because of pressure they put on her. she always liked to show off, sing and dance. that was a natural thing for her. i believe that it is because of this naturalness that she is where she is today.”nannannannan
intermediate	‘fit in four minutes’ sounds like a headline from a health magazine or an impossible promise on late-night satellite tv. then you try dr izumi tabata’s training programme – 20 seconds of allout effort, ten seconds of rest, repeat eight times – and, after collapsing on the floor, you realize you were wrong.tabata has seen it all before. “they were dead!” he laughs as he remembers the first time he tried out his system on his university students in the early 1990s. “after four minutes’ hard exercise they were completely exhausted. but after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised. we all were.”he began his research after he watched japan’s speed skating team in the early 1990s – he noticed that short bursts of incredibly hard exercise seemed to be at least as effective as hours of moderate training. tabata tried to prove this with a simple experiment. one group of moderately trained students did an hour of steady cardiovascular exercise on an exercise bike five times a week. the other group did a ten-minute warm-up on the bike, followed by four minutes of tabata training, four times a week – plus one 30-minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of tabata.the results were very surprising. after six weeks of testing, the group following tabata’s plan – exercising for just 88 minutes a week – had increased their anaerobic capacity by 28% and their vo2 max, something that shows your cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power, by 15%. the control group, who trained for five hours every week, also improved their vo2 max, but by 10% – and their training had no effect on anaerobic capacity.”we also measured increases in heart size after three weeks of doing the exercises,” says tabatabut you have to work very, very hard. you can’t sit on a cross trainer, chewing gum and reading the latest issue of hello! the programme demands intensive bursts on a stationary bike or rowing machine; explosive bodyweight exercises, sprints and so on. remember how you felt after doing a 100m sprint at school? imagine doing eight of them with only a tensecond break to recover.“all-out effort at 170% of your vo2 max is the basis of the programme,” says tabata. “if you feel ok afterwards, you’ve not done it properly. the first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossibly hard. in the original plan the aim was to get to eight, but some only managed six or seven.”one person on an online forum wrote: “when done correctly you should meet god. most people are incapable of doing it correctly and shouldn’t even try.” tabata doesn’t completely agree. “everyone can do it but beginners should start with educated trainers so that they can work at the correct intensity for them,” he explains. he adds that his programme burns an extra 150 calories in the 12 hours after exercise, even at rest. so, although it is used by most people to get fit – or by fit people to get even fitter – it also burns fat.it’s slightly surprising, therefore, that only serious athletes follow the programme at the moment. but that may change now that tabata has agreed a deal that will lead to a network of instructors and a dvd range released towards the end of the year. “i decided to do this because i often go on youtube and, while i am pleased that people are doing it, some are doing it wrong because they don’t realize how hard they need to work,” says tabata.so should we all start following this plan? richard scrivener, a former rugby fitness coach, says that while the benefits are clear, tabatas are an addition, not a replacement, to a favoured sport or training method. “runners, for instance, need a high level of running economy, which comes from learning the skills and running for many miles,” says scrivener, “but they could reduce the number of long runs and the overall mileage by introducing tabata training. this will give joints the chance to rest and recover, especially if you have a history of injuries – and you would probably therefore get more benefit from the long runs when you do them.”gym rats can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three tabatas a week. and the rest of us can slowly increase the number of sessions, although we know that it will never get easier because every session needs maximum effort. that’s the cruel genius of the programme: it is hard – and effective.nannan
intermediate	on one day in august, one in seven people on earth, 1 billion people, used facebook, according to founder mark zuckerberg. in ten years, the social network has completely changed peopleõs relationships, privacy, their businesses, news media, helped to end regimes and even changed the meanings of common words.òa more open and connected world is a better world. it brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society,ó wrote zuckerberg.these are just some of the ways his company changed everything ð for better or worse.1 facebook has changed the de nition of òfriendó òto friendó is now a verb. and, unlike in real life, it is easy to òunfriendó someone, a word invented to describe ending a facebook friendship when that person is no longer improving your facebook newsfeed.although the meanings of the words òshareó and òlikeó are basically the same, facebook has made the terms more important to us.school and university reunions are unnecessary ð you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and youõve seen pictures of your schoolmatesõ babies. you wonõt be surprised to see an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyõre dating someone else from the romantic sel es.but, unlike in real life, on facebook, all your friends have the same importance. a classmate from university who you havenõt seen for 15 years, a friend-of-a-friend from a party or a colleague youõve never actually spoken to in person ð they are all facebook friends in the same way as your closest friend or your spouse or your mum.it doesnõt necessarily mean we see them the same way. professor robin dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have about 150 people as a social group. facebook hasnõt changed that yet, he believes. but dunbar says he fears it is so easy simply to end friendships on facebook that, eventually, people may not need to learn to get on with each other.2 we care less about privacy the surprising thing is that facebook users happily hand over their information.pew research center found that most young people are more than willing to hand over their details. ninety- one per cent post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.but, because so much of a personõs life is shared online, facebook gives people a way to create an image and a fanbase. academics have described a new phenomenon: the òfacebook selfó.more than 80% of facebook users list their interests, which allows brands to target them effectively. but most younger users limit who can see their pro les, with 60% allowing friends only.3 facebook has created millions of jobs ð but not in its own of ces facebook provides indirect employment for people whose job it is to make facebook work for their brand.òit is a tool like no other,ó said michael tinmouth, a social media strategist who has worked with brands such as vodafone and microsoft. òmarketers have an understanding of a brandõs customers like they have never had before. the data available is extraordinary. you know who your customers are, who they are friends with and how they engage with your brand.óand advertisers pay a lot for that. facebook reported advertising revenue had increased by 46%, reaching $3.32bn.facebook is also a mine eld for brands. suddenly, customers donõt simply complain on the phone to a customer service representative or on a small specialist internet forum ð angry customers can post their complaints for hundreds of their friends to see or even on the brandõs own page.4 facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by facebook. manchester universityõs olga onuch found facebook had been the key way for reaching half of all the euromaidan protesters in ukraine. many of the people interviewed in onuchõs research said they relied on facebook for the truth about what was happening ð they donõt trust traditional media.5 facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news about 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63% of users overall, according to the pew research center. about a third of facebook users post about politics and government.most people will  rst read an item of breaking news via facebook or other social media, mostly on mobiles.facebook has also changed the ways journalists write stories. it is a resource many reporters cannot now live without. for better or (often) worse, it is a place to  nd information on almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly  nd themselves at the centre of the dayõs biggest news story.6 users are changing facebook it used to be a site for students of top us universities.in 2014, ten years after its launch, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a facebook account. and 39% are connected to people they have never met in person.more than ever, the site is a gateway not just to your friends but to the rest of the internet.we may as well get used to it, said david kirkpatrick, author of the facebook effect. òit might very well go away further down the road but something this big takes a long time to disappear,ó he told bbc radio 4õs today programme. òfacebook has proven its ability to change and it will continue to be a very, very major player.ónannan
intermediate	the manchester united manager, sir alex ferguson, will retire at the end of the season after 27 years as the most successful manager in british football. he will become a director of the club and someone will have to replace a man who has won 13 english premier league titles, two champions leagues, the cup winners’ cup, five fa cups and four league cups.talking about his decision, ferguson said: “the decision to retire is one that i have thought a great deal about. it is the right time. it was important to me to leave an organization in the strongest possible condition and i believe i have done so. the quality of this squad, and the balance of ages within it, bodes well for continued success at the highest level. the structure of the youth set-up will ensure that the long-term future of the club remains a bright one.“our training facilities are amongst the best in world sport and our home, old trafford, is regarded as one of the leading venues in the world. i am delighted to take on the roles of both director and ambassador for the club. with these activities, along with my many other interests, i am looking forward to the future. i must pay tribute to my family; their love and support has been essential.“as for my players and staff, past and present, i would like to thank them all for a staggering level of professional conduct and dedication that has helped to deliver so many memorable triumphs. without their contribution, the history of this great club would not be as rich. in my early years, the support of the board of directors gave me the confidence and time to build a football club, not just a football team.“over the past ten years, the glazer family have made it possible for me to manage manchester united to the best of my ability and i have been extremely fortunate to have worked with a talented and trustworthy chief executive, david gill. i am truly grateful to all of them. to the fans, thank you. it has been an honour and an enormous privilege to have had the opportunity to lead your club and i have treasured my time as manager of manchester united.”the suddenness of ferguson’s departure is exactly how he said he would leave the job. he first mentioned the possibility of retiring during the 2001/2 season but then performed a u-turn. it is understood that he gathered the players in the first-team changing room shortly after they arrived for training. in an emotional speech, he announced he was retiring.joel glazer, joint owner of manchester united, said: “alex has proven time and time again what a fantastic manager he is but he’s also a wonderful person. his determination to succeed and dedication to the club have been truly remarkable. i will never forget the wonderful memories he has given us, like that magical night in moscow.”avie glazer, his brother, said: “i am delighted to announce that alex has agreed to stay with the club as a director. his contributions to manchester united over the last 27 years have been extraordinary and, like all united fans, i want him to be a part of its future.”david gill added: “i’ve had the tremendous pleasure of working very closely with alex for 16 unforgettable years – we have had countless wins and numerous signings. we knew that his retirement would come one day and we both have been planning for it by ensuring the quality of the team and club structures are in first-class condition. alex’s vision, energy and ability have built teams that are among the best and most loyal in world sport.“the way he cares for this club, his staff and for the football family in general is something that i admire. what he has done for this club and for the game in general will never be forgotten. it has been the greatest experience of my working life being with alex and a great honour to be able to call him a friend.”first-team coach rené meulensteen revealed how ferguson broke the news to his backroom staff. “i found out this morning when i came to the club,” he said. “he called us into his office and told us his decision. he’s obviously a man who thinks very, very hard so i’m sure he’s put a lot of thought into making this decision. i wish him well. he’s been fantastic for this club and i hope all the fans give the new manager the same support that he gets.”nan
intermediate	water scientists have given one of the strongest warnings ever about global food supplies. they say that the world’s population may have to change almost completely to a vegetarian diet by 2050 to avoid catastrophic shortages.humans get about 20% of their protein from animal-based products now. however, this may need to decrease to just 5% to feed the extra two billion people expected to be alive by 2050, according to research by some of the world’s top water scientists.“there will not be enough water to produce food for the expected nine-billion population in 2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards diets common in western nations,” the report by malik falkenmark and colleagues at the stockholm international water institute (siwi) said.“there will be just enough water if the proportion of animal-based foods is limited to 5% of total calories.”warnings that water scarcity could limit food production come at the same time as oxfam and the un prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years. prices for items such as corn and wheat have risen nearly 50% on international markets since june. the price increase has been caused by severe droughts in the us and russia, and weak monsoon rains in asia. more than 18 million people are already facing serious food shortages across the sahel.oxfam says that the price increase will have a devastating effect in developing countries that rely heavily on food imports, including parts of latin america, north africa and the middle east. food shortages in 2008 led to fighting and riots in 28 countries.changing to a vegetarian diet is one way to increase the amount of water available to grow more food in a world where the climate is becoming increasingly erratic, the scientists said. animal protein-rich food uses five to ten times more water than a vegetarian diet. one third of the world’s arable land is used to grow crops to feed animals. other options to feed people include stopping waste and increasing trade between countries that have a food surplus and countries that don’t have enough food.“nine hundred million people already go hungry and two billion people are malnourished although per-capita food production continues to increase,” they said. “seventy per cent of all water is used in agriculture, and growing more food to feed an extra two billion people by 2050 will place greater pressure on water and land.”the report is being released at the start of the annual world water conference in stockholm, sweden, where 2,500 politicians, un groups, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries meet to discuss global water supply problems.competition for water between food production and other uses will increase pressure on essential resources, the scientists said. “the un predicts that we must increase food production by 70% by mid-century. this will put additional pressure on our water resources, which are already stressed, at a time when we also need more water to satisfy global energy demand and to create electricity for the 1.3 billion people who are without it,” said the report.overeating, malnourishment and waste are all increasing. “we will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future,” said the report’s editor, anders jägerskog.nannannannan
intermediate	on an average day its outlets host everything from business meetings to reading groups. all these people are looking for that important morning coffee. but starbucks should be careful what it wishes for.the direct action group uk uncut plans to turn dozens of the coffee empire’s uk outlets into crèches, refuges and homeless shelters to highlight starbucks’ tax avoidance tactics.they announced the action as starbucks were questioned by the house of commons public accounts committee. they asked why the company paid no corporation tax in the uk during the past three years, despite the company’s profitable business in britain.when he appears before the committee, starbucks’ chief financial officer, troy alstead, will attempt to repair the company’s reputation.mps accused the hm revenue & customs (hmrc), the uk’s tax department, of having cosy relationships with big businesses. speaking about the arrangements with starbucks, the conservative mp richard bacon said: “it smells. and it doesn’t smell of coffee – it smells bad.”the campaign group uk uncut wants to show a connection between government cuts, in particular those that affect women, and tax avoidance by multinational businesses.sarah greene, a uk uncut activist, said funding for refuges and rape crisis centres would be reduced unless companies paid the fair amount of tax. hmrc estimates around £32bn was lost due to tax avoidance in 2011.greene said the government could easily collect billions that could help pay for necessary services if they were stricter on tax avoidance.the group, which became known because of its protests at vodafone stores, topshop and fortnum & mason, turned its attentions to starbucks beause an investigation discovered the company had paid only £8.6m in corporation tax since launching in the uk in 1998, despite cumulative sales of £3bn.uncut campaigner anna walker said “we’ve chosen to really highlight the impact of the cuts on women. so we’re going to focus on transforming starbucks into those services that the government are cutting, such as refuges and crèches.“starbucks is a really great target because it is on every high street across the country and that’s what uk uncut finds really important: people can take action in their local areas,” she said.several international organizations have been criticized over their uk accounts. amazon, ebay, facebook, google and ikea all pay little or no corporation tax.the coffee store chain, starbucks, insists it pays the correct level of taxes. the group chief executive, howard schultz, has said in a statement: “starbucks has always paid taxes in the uk.“over the last three years alone, our company has paid more than £160m in various taxes, including national insurance*, vat and business rates.”margaret hodge, who leads the public accounts committee, told parliament last month that apple, ebay, facebook, google and starbucks had avoided nearly £900m of tax. the prime minister, david cameron, responded to the claim by saying: “i’m not happy with the current situation. i think [hmrc] needs to look at it very carefully. we do need to make sure we continue to encourage these businesses to invest in our country, but they should be paying fair taxes as well.”a spokeswoman for starbucks said: “while the subject of tax law can be extremely complex, starbucks respects and obeys tax laws and accounting rules in each of the 61 countries where we do business, including the uk. we’ve posted the facts about our tax practices in the uk on our website.“starbucks’ economic impact in the uk goes far beyond our stores and partners [employees]. we spend hundreds of millions of pounds with local suppliers on milk, cakes and sandwiches, and on store design and renovations. when you consider the indirect employment created by starbucks’ investments in the uk, the company’s extended economic impact to the uk economy is more than £80m a year”.nannan
intermediate	as soon as the children at one primary school in stirling, scotland, hear the words òdaily mileó, they put down their pencils and leave the classroom to start running around the school  eld. for three-and-a-half years, all the pupils at st ninianõs primary school have walked or run a mile each day. they do it at different times during the day and, despite the rise in childhood obesity across the uk, none of the children at the school are overweight.the daily mile has done so much to improve these childrenõs  tness, behaviour and concentration in lessons that many other british schools are doing the same. they are getting pupils to get up from their desks and take 15 minutes to walk or run round the school or local park.elaine wyllie, headteacher of st ninianõs, said: òi get at least two emails a day from other schools and local authorities asking how we do it. the thought of children across the country running every day because of something weõve done is phenomenal.one in ten children are obese when they start school at the age of four or  ve, according to the health & social care information centre, and, in the summer of 2015, a study found that schoolchildren in england are the least  t they have ever been. primary schools therefore accept the bene ts of the daily mile. it has been introduced in schools in various parts of the uk and other schools are planning to launch the initiative during the 2015-16 academic year. in stirling alone, 30 schools have already started or will soon start the daily mile.òitõs a common-sense approach to childrenõs  tness, which is free and easy. the most important thing is that the children really enjoy it; otherwise, you couldnõt sustain it. they come back inside bright-eyed and rosy-cheeked, how children used to look,ó said wyllie. at st ninianõs, teachers take their pupils out of lessons to a specially built circuit around the schoolõs playing  eld for their daily mile whenever it best suits that dayõs timetable. only ice or very heavy rain stop them.the extent of the bene ts isnõt known yet but researchers from stirling university have launched a comparative study to look for evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional bene ts of the daily mile. dr colin moran, who is leading the study, said: òthe children donõt seem to have problems with obesity; they seem happier and staff say they settle into lessons faster so we designed a study that would test all of these things.ó st ninianõs pupils will be compared with children from another school in stirling that hasnõt yet started the scheme.kevin clelland, a primary school teacher from leeds, visited st ninianõs and, then, convinced his colleagues it was a great idea. he said: òitõs such a simple thing to do but seems to have such an amazing impact. weõre really committed to improving the  tness of our pupils.ó his school is now building a track.active cheshire, a sports and  tness organization in cheshire, is taking a group of senior people from the local authority up to scotland to assess the results of the daily mile. the hope is to introduce it across the 450 schools in their region if a pilot programme is successful.paralympian, tanni grey-thompson, chair of ukactive, a health organization for physical activity, said: òall children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day, whether in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground. itõs fantastic to see initiatives like the daily mile, showing real leadership from the education sector to improve childrenõs  tness levels and their cognitive behaviour, and make a real difference to schools, teachers, parents and young peopleõs lives. we know sitting still kills; not sitting still helps children build skills that will stay with them for life.óthe scottish government also supports the initiative. a spokesperson said: òlearning in pe is enhanced by initiatives like the daily mile, which can encourage and support parents in fostering healthy habits with their children from a young age. we are pleased to see so many scottish schools are taking part or planning to do so.ó
elementary	a group of experts say that thousands of people are taking unnecessary medicines and have bad diets because of bogus allergy tests. allergies and food intolerances are increasing very quickly but people do not understand the difference between an allergy and a food intolerance – this is causing problems, says the charity sense about science, who have written a guide to allergies.“it’s a big mess,” said tracey brown, director of sense about science. “there is unnecessary action for people who don’t really have allergies and not enough action for people who have allergies.”lots of people tell the waiter or waitress in a restaurant that they have an allergy. but some of these people don’t have an allergy – that have a food intolerance, which is not dangerous. experts fear that restaurants hear so many people say that they have allergies (when maybe that is not true) that they may not be careful enough when they give food to a person who has a real allergy.“it matters very much,” said moira austin of an allergy charity. “if a restaurant thinks somebody just doesn’t want to eat a food because it makes them feel uncomfortable, the restaurant may be less careful. there have been deaths where people have gone to a restaurant, told the waiter or waitress that they have an allergy to a food and the meal has been given to them containing that food.”the guide says most allergy tests bought on the internet or in shops do not work. they include a test people can use at home, which looks for specific antibodies against different foods in the blood. these antibodies are part of the body’s response to infections but “the best medical evidence has shown high antibody levels do not suggest an allergy”, the guide says. the test often shows people have an allergy or a food intolerance when this is not true.another test also does not work. it uses a mixture of acupuncture and homeopathy. testing hair is also pointless, the guide says. “hair cannot show if you are allergic or not so testing hair cannot give any useful information on allergies.”“i often see children who are on very limited diets – their parents believe that they have allergies because they have taken ‘allergy tests’ that do not work,” said paul seddon, an allergy doctor for children. “this needs to stop, which can only happen if we prove these ‘tests’ do not work.”allergies can cause tiredness, headaches and eczema in children. but you need to check if they have an allergy and this takes a long time and many tests. it may seem like a good idea to do just one test and get a quick answer. but, it will be a wrong answer.allergies are increasing in developed countries. there are three times more children with certain allergies now compared to 30 years ago. the sense about science guide lists a number of myths about the sources of allergies, for example the myths that fast food or e numbers in food colourings cause allergies.nan

elementary	a menu scandal at some of japan’s top hotels and department stores is damaging the international reputation of japanese food.one luxury hotel group admitted that it lied about ingredients on its menus. since then, there have been similar stories from restaurants run by famous hotels and department stores in japan.the story began when the hankyu-hanshin hotel group admitted that it gave false descriptions of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and october 2013.for example, the red salmon ‘caviar’ that customers ordered was in fact the eggs of the flying fish.the hotel group’s president, hiroshi desaki, went on television to announce a 20% pay cut for himself and 10% for other executives. but this did not make customers less angry.days later, desaki resigned – he said that the hotel group had betrayed their customers.so far, the company has refunded 20 million yen to more than 10,000 consumers. in total, they will refund 110 million yen.customers who believed they ate expensive kuruma shrimps were told they in fact ate much cheaper black tiger shrimps.complained in a blogpost that a ‘scallop’ dish he ordered at the prince hotel in tokyo contained a similar, but cheaper, type of shellfish.the hotel investigated the complaint and as a result corrected more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants. its report scared hankyu-hanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they, too, lied to customers who believed they were paying high prices for top ingredients.the hotel okura group – where barack obama has stayed – said they also injected beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly described tomatoes as organic.“we apologize for lying to our clients,” it said.the list of fraudulent ingredients gets bigger: orange juice from cartons that was sold as freshly squeezed; mont blanc desserts with korean chestnuts instead of the french ones on the menu; shop-bought chocolate cream that the menu said was home-made; imported beef sold as expensive wagyu beef.the menu scandal has come at the wrong time. japan is trying to persuade south korea and other countries to start to buy japanese food again after the fukushima nuclear accident.food industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 forced luxury hotels to save money.“menu descriptions were created to sound good to the customers, and, when hotels couldn’t get the ingredients on the menu, they just used food from different places,” hiroshi tomozawa, a hotel and restaurant consultant, told kyodo news.nannannannannannan
elementary	the international monetary fund (imf) has asked the usa to manage its money better. hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work after the government shut down for 16 days.us president barack obama said that the us has to be more careful with how it manages its money. the imf’s managing director, christine lagarde, asked for more stability.the senate wrote a peace deal, which included almost nothing that the conservatives asked for. the conservative republicans nearly caused a new financial crisis because they did not agree to obama’s healthcare reforms. the house of representatives agreed the deal at the last minute.the world bank was also pleased that the world’s economy had “avoided a catastrophe”. its president, jim yong kim, asked politicians in all countries to continue to make policies that improve the economy and give jobs and opportunity to all.the shutdown cost the us $24 billion.obama signed the legislation shortly after midnight on thursday. the bill passed easily, with support from all parties in the senate, where democratic and republican leaders wrote the agreement. it is a temporary solution. it gives the government money until 15 january and allows the government to borrow more money if they want to until 7 february.but the president made clear that he did not expect another serious budget fight and shutdown in 2014.at the white house, obama said he hoped the deal would “lift the cloud of uncertainty” that had hung over the country in recent weeks.“when this agreement arrives on my desk, i will sign it immediately,” he said. “hopefully, next time, it won’t be in the eleventh hour. we must manage our money better.”a journalist asked the president if the crisis would happen again in a few months. obama replied: “no.”earlier, the republican senator mike lee said there would be more trouble: “the media keeps asking: ‘was it worth it?’ my answer is, it is always worth it to do the right thing.” he added: “this is not over.”but the political deal on wednesday was one of the worst of all possible results for republicans. they did not achieve any of their goals and most people blamed them for the crisis.nannannan
elementary	james bond films are one of the world’s oldest and most successful film series. twenty-three bond films have been made so far. they have earned more than $6 billion at cinemas around the world. james bond is not slowing down. in fact, the films are more popular than ever – skyfall, which broke all records and became the biggest ever film at uk cinemas in 2012, earned a total of $1.1 billion.so, there was a lot of interest when they announced more details about the 24th bond film – especially its title, spectre. the number one question is: can spectre be as successful as skyfall?charles gant, film editor for heat magazine, thinks it can. “they were very clever when they made skyfall,” he says. “it was both modern and retro. daniel craig fans liked it and, also, older, more nostalgic bond fans, who lost interest over the previous few films. with the new title,” he adds, “it is certain to be a success.”eon productions is the company, started in 1961, that made dr no and all the “official” bond films. the company really wants the next film to be successful so it is using the same people that worked on skyfall in the new film. daniel craig will play bond and the same people have written the script. most importantly, sam mendes will again be the director. according to gant, mendes is the best bond director. gant says: “mendes attracted top actors like ralph fiennes. actors like fiennes will only be in a film if they like the director.”the bond series was not in trouble before the arrival of mendes – and craig – but the films were becoming a bit boring towards the end of pierce brosnan’s time as bond. there were no longer any more original bond stories to adapt and the films no longer had enough energy.this was nothing new: the history of the bond series has been one of constant change, especially of the lead actor: first, sean connery; then, george lazenby, roger moore, timothy dalton, brosnan and, now, craig. each new actor has been different and some have been better than others.lazenby only did one bond film. dalton’s two films, the living daylights and licence to kill, were during a period in the late 80s when more aggressive hollywood action movies were more popular. according to gant, “the period of roger moore’s last films and dalton’s films didn’t excite audiences. brosnan was more successful but craig is the best. on the other hand, the early bond films were sexy and exciting.”skyfall made more money than all the other bond films. but some of the 1960s bond films were almost as successful. with figures adjusted for inflation, the 1965 film thunderball is only a little bit below skyfall. and goldfinger and you only live twice both did better than the other craig films. licence to kill made the least money of all bond films and moore’s final film, a view to a kill, the second least.martin campbell is an experienced british director and he planned one of the most elaborate stunts in bond history. in the famous first scene of goldeneye (released in 1995), bond falls into a light aeroplane without a pilot. this scene helped to make the bond series more modern and popular. also, a very successful goldeneye video game created new, younger fans of bond and made people think that the bond film was no longer boring and old-fashioned.nannannannannan
elementary	the last time she performed, we did not have mobile phones. now, 35 years later, as she performs again, singer kate bush sees a very different world.these days, most concerts are now lit up with phones and tablets, but bush does not want her fans to watch her shows through a screen.in august, before her concerts at the hammersmith apollo in london, bush asked her fans to put down their mobile phones at her gigs.bush wrote on her website: “i have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows. we have chosen a theatre, not a large venue or stadium. please do not take photos or videos during the shows.“i very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iphones, ipads or cameras.”bush is not the first singer or musician to say she doesn’t like phones at concerts. roger daltrey from the who recently said it was “weird” that people looked at their screen and not the artist on stage.he said: “i feel sorry for them, i really feel sorry for them. looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally – if you’re doing that, you’re 50% there, right? it’s weird.”in 2013, beyoncé told a fan, “you can’t even sing because you’re too busy filming. put that damn camera down!”recently, dutch football fans at psv eindhoven protested against the introduction of wi-fi in their stadium. they held up banners that said “no wi-fi. support the team,” and “you can sit at home.” manchester united have also told fans to leave their “large electronic devices” at home.singer jarvis cocker said, “it seems stupid to have something happening in front of you and look at it on a screen that’s smaller than a cigarette packet.”even in the world of classical music, one of the world’s top pianists surprised the audience in june 2013 when he left the stage because a fan was filming his performance on a smartphone. krystian zimerman returned moments later and said: “the destruction of music because of youtube is enormous.”but sam watt says that filming at concerts makes the experience even better. he works for vyclone, a phone app that puts together many videos uploaded by fans to create one long video of a show.“fans filming is now part of the concert experience – that is a just a fact. we take the videos that people are filming at concerts and mix them together with everybody else who was filming. the result is a really fantastic video,” he said.“we think that filming at concerts adds to the experience, and i think that, if kate bush came round for a cup of tea, we could have a really interesting discussion about this,” he added. “people are going to film and they want those memories – you’ve got to accept it.”nannannannannannan
elementary	when larry pizzi first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago, he asked: “why would anyone want to spoil a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it?”it’s a question that some people still ask. many bicycle shops in the us do not sell e-bikes.pizzi is ceo of currie technologies, the number one seller of e-bikes in the us. he believes that things will change very soon. other people who sell bikes agree. familiar brands including trek, raleigh and specialized all offer electric bikes and they believe that the market is going to grow.the us is different from other countries when it comes to electric bikes. nearly 32 million e-bikes were sold in 2014, most of them in china, where people mostly use them for transportation. they are popular in many parts of europe, too. they’re common in the netherlands and switzerland; german postal workers use them and bmw sells one for about $3,000.electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds, which use motors; you pedal an electric bike with – or without – help from an electric motor. riding an e-bike feels like riding a normal bike with a strong wind behind you; the motor just helps you go faster or climb hills. you can usually ride e-bicycles on bike lanes and they can’t travel faster than 20mph.e-bikes are banned in some states in the us, including new york. some bike shops don’t like putting motors on bicycles because it makes them too heavy. some e-bikes weigh nearly 30kg.e-bikes are also expensive. while cheap bikes sell for just $700, you will pay at least $1,500 for a quality e-bike with a good battery. the best bikes cost more than $3,000.but e-bike technology, particularly the batteries, is improving. “batteries are getting smaller, they’re getting lighter, they’re getting more reliable and they are lasting longer,” says don dicostanza, the ceo of pedego, an electric bikemaker and retailer.perhaps most importantly, more cities are building bike lanes so bicycle commuting has become more popular. electric bikes make commuting more practical – and fun – because people don’t have to worry about hills, strong winds, tiredness and sweat.most of our customers are “baby boomers who want to have the cycling experience they had as a kid,” says pedego’s don dicostanza. “the main reason they stopped riding bikes was because of hills.” pedego has opened nearly 60 stores in the us.electrobike has 30 stores in mexico. it opened its first american store in venice beach, california in 2014 and hopes to have 25 us stores in a year. ceo craig anderson says: “we want to help reduce traffic, help reduce our carbon footprint and encourage a healthy lifestyle.” he tells customers: “ride this bike once and try not to smile.”currie’s larry pizzi thinks that e-bikes will become popular in north america. “a lot of young people are using e-bikes for transportation, instead of cars.”there is even a cargo bike with a stronger motor and rack at the back. “you can carry two children,” says pizzi. “you can carry 45kg of shopping. it’s a minivan alternative.”nannannannan
elementary	people today might not hear the sounds of the natural world because they screen out the noises around them, says a us researcher.more background noise can make people oblivious to the uplifting sounds of birdsong, water and trees in the wind. you can often hear these sounds even in cities, said kurt fristrup, a senior scientist at the us national park service.the problem is even worse because people listen to music through their earphones instead of listening to the birds and other sounds of nature. natural sounds are easily drowned out by traf c, music and others noises, fristrup said.òthis learned deafness is a real problem,ó fristrup told the american association for the advancement of science meeting in san jose. òwe are training ourselves to ignore the information that comes into our ears.òthis gift that we are born with ð the ability to hear things hundreds of metres away, all these incredible sounds ð might be lost,ó he said.this is the problem: we hear so many noises that we stop listening.for the past ten years, the us national park service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 parks in the us, including yosemite in california, yellowstone and denali in alaska. there was noise from human activity in all the parks, for example aircraft, motorbikes, motorboats and tour buses.fristrupõs team say that noise pollution more than doubles every 30 years. òitõs not surprising people put on earphones,ó he said.òmore background noise has the same effect on your hearing as fog has on your vision ð you are aware of only a small area around you,ó he said. even in our cities, there are birds and things to appreciate in the environment but we are losing the ability to hear them.people quickly become used to changes in their environments, including more noise. fristrup worries that we will forget how much quieter the world could be. òif  nding peace and quiet becomes too dif cult, many children will grow up without the experience and i think itõs a very big problem,ó he said.other scientists reported health bene ts from listening to natural sounds. speaking at the same meeting, derrick taff, a social scientist at pennsylvania state university, said that listening to recordings from national parks, of waterfalls, birdsong and wind, helped people feel less stressed.òwe know that natural sounds are very important to people. they are some of the main reasons people visit protected areas. they want to hear the natural quiet, the birdsong, and the wind and water,ó taff said. òwe may be losing this as people are listening to their ipods all the time. my advice is to go to your protected areas and experience what you are missing.ónannannan
elementary	mcdonaldõs is the worldõs biggest burger chain and a symbol of american consumer capitalism. but, these days, the golden arches of mcdonaldõs are not looking so golden. the company has got much bigger since 2003 but, now, the numbers of customers are falling. mcdonaldõs says that its worldwide sales have fallen by 3.3%.the company has problems almost everywhere. in china, sales fell by 23%. in europe, sales fell by 4%, mostly because of problems in ukraine and the anti-western mood in russia. health inspectors have investigated around 200 of mcdonaldõs 450 restaurants in russia and they have closed ten restaurants.but the worst crisis is in the us, where mcdonaldõs has around 40% of its restaurants. almost 60 years since ray kroc opened his  rst restaurant in des plaines, illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a big mac and fries. sales have fallen every month for 12 months in the us. many younger diners are eating at rival companies such as chipotle mexican grill. the number of 19-to-21-year-olds who visit mcdonaldõs once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011.another problem is that mcdonaldõs hamburgers were recently named the worst in america in a poll of more than 32,000 american diners ð they said they would rather eat a burger at five guys, smashburger or fuddruckers. many people also believe that mcdonaldõs is less healthy than most of its rivals, especially chipotle. chipotle uses antibiotic-free meat and òlocally sourced, seasonaló ingredients.mcdonaldõs asked customers for their opinions in the us in october. someone asked òhave you ever used pink slime in your burgers?ó ð ôpink slimeõ is the beef  ller that is used for dog food. mcdonaldõs stopped using this meat product in 2012 but mcdonaldõs chief executive don thompson said the company still had to improve peopleõs opinions about the freshness and quality of its ingredients.mcdonaldõs has always had a reputation for fast service at low prices. but, since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, people think it is more expensive than its rivals and many consumers complain that service is slower.but mary chapman at food analysts technomic said that it wasnõt fair to say that mcdonaldõs was more expensive than its rivals. òprices have gone up but they havenõt gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-food chains in the us.ó prices at mcdonaldõs have increased by 4.8% since 2009, much less than the fast-food average (up 19.4%).but people are right when they complain that the queues are longer. mcdonaldõs has a bigger menu than some other restaurants, with more complicated items ð its chicken mcwrap takes 60 seconds to make. òi think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not,ó said chapman.mcdonald managers are promising to improve peopleõs opinions about its food in the us. thompson has promised more organic food and òbuild your own burgersó. but, to reduce queues, he also wants to introduce simpler menus. how can the company have simpler menus and, at the same time, a larger selection of  llings? òthey want to simplify the menu but also offer ôbuild your own burgersõ ð that sounds tricky,ó said consumer expert mark kalinowski. only four out of mcdonaldõs 14,000 us restaurants have tested òbuild your own burgeró, he said. òright now, we are sceptical; we would like to see more detail.ósales are falling but mcdonaldõs continues to expand around the world: by the end of 2014, it expects to open 1,400 new restaurants. kalinowski thinks that mcdonaldõs sales will continue to fall but he thinks it will be number one for many years.nannannan
elementary	the duke and duchess of cambridge have won the first part of their fight for privacy. a french magazine was told to stop selling or reusing photos of the royal couple. the pictures show the duchess sunbathing topless while on holiday in the south of france.it is possible that the magazine editor and the photographer or photographers will also have to go to a criminal court.the french magazine closer was told to give digital files of the pictures to the couple within 24 hours.closer’s publisher, mondadori magazines france, was also told to pay €2,000 in legal costs. the magazine will have to pay €10,000 for every day it does not give the couple the files.the court decided that every time mondadori – the publishing company owned by the ex italian prime minister silvio berlusconi – publishes a photograph in the future in france, they will get €10,000 fine.the couple welcome the judge’s decision. “they always believed the law was broken and that they had a right to their privacy.”the royal couple are pleased with the decision, but they want to have a much more public criminal trial against the magazine and photographer or photographers.under french law, if you do not respect someone’s privacy, you may have to spend a maximum of one year in prison and pay a fine of €45,000.this punishment would send a message to the world and, the couple hope, stop paparazzi taking photos like this in the future.on saturday the irish daily star also published the photos. and the italian celebrity magazine chi published a special edition of 26 pages with the photos of the future queen.nannannannannannannan
advanced	from all across rwanda, and even parts of neighbouring burundi, people  ock to the southern town of butare to a little shop called inzozi nziza (sweet dreams). they come for a taste of the unknown, something most have never tasted ð the sweet, cold, velvety embrace of ice cream.here, at the central african countryõs  rst ice- cream parlour, customers can buy scoops in sweet cream, passion fruit, strawberry and pineapple  avours. toppings include fresh fruit, honey, chocolate chips and granola. black tea and coffee are also on sale.the shop, which has òice cream, coffee, dreamsó across its signage, is milking local curiosity about the dessert ð and òchanging livesó in the process, says inzozi nzizaõs manager, louise ingabire.òice cream is important,ó she says between mouthfuls of a honey- avoured offering. òsome rwandans like ice cream, but itõs a new thing. we still have some work to do, to tell others that theyõll enjoy it.ótrue to inzozi nzizaõs motto, the shop can certainly make dreams come true. òi didnõt have a job before: i just stayed at home. now, i have a vision for the future. i am making money and i can give some of it to my family,ó says the 27-year-old.butare, which has 89,600 residents and is located 135km south of the capital, kigali, is the home of the national university of rwanda. inzozi nziza has become a hub for tired students looking to treat themselves to something cool and different.òitõs something uniting people here,ó kalisa migendo, a 24-year-old agriculture student, says. òif you need to go out and talk to a friend, a girl or a boy, you come to inzozi nziza for an ice cream.ómost of the ingredients are sourced locally and the milk comes from a depot in nearby nyanza. the vanilla beans and cocoa are imported.inzozi nziza was opened by the theatre director odile gakire katese. she met alexis miesen and jennie dundas, co-founders of blue marble ice cream in brooklyn, new york, and formed a partnership to open the shop in 2010.òan ice-cream shop, katese proposed, might help to put the human pieces back together by rebuilding spirits, hopes and family traditions,ó miesen says.at the start, miesen and dundas owned the shop in partnership with its staff and had shares in the business, which is a cooperative and non-pro t. they did not set  nancial targets, but waited for 18 months before they transferred their shares to the women, who had by then proved their business credentials.the shopõs success is no exception, says fatuma ndangiza, deputy chief executive of the rwanda governance board. òsmall businesses are mostly managed by women but when it comes to big business where you have to compete for big tenders, very few women are there. women are newcomers to big business,ó she points out. òwe have more women entrepreneurs. itõs an area where women are taking an interest, both in and outside kigali.óthough ice cream is somewhat new to rwanda, ndangiza is enthused by the idea of the shop. òi think itõs great. it requires a lot of skills and changing peopleõs mindsets because selling and eating ice cream is not part of our culture. i think being able to innovate and introduce this on the market, and the process of making it, is quite interesting.óthe butare shop employs nine women, who spend their spare time practising with ingoma nshya, rwandaõs  rst and only female drumming troupe, which was established by katese ten years ago.the musicians are hutu and tutsi women, some survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million tutsis and moderate hutus were killed.some members of ingoma nshya are widows, some orphans. others have been affected by the massacre in different ways.historically, says ingabire, rwandan women were forbidden to drum and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry. òbut itõs something which brings unity.óingabireõs father, two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide. òsome of us are survivors; some know someone who was killed,ó she says. òwhen iõm drumming with them, it gives me power because weõre still alive and survivors.óthe popular eatery features in a documentary by rob and lisa fruchtman, sibling  lm-makers. sweet dreams, which tells the story of how the women have forged a promising post-genocide future, also includes the female drummers.the  lm, which has been screened in more than a dozen countries, including the us, uk and several african states, premieres in rwanda in 2014. òwe feel the  lm is about resilience, hope, bravery, resourcefulness and the ability to change the course of your own life,ó says lisa fruchtman, who won an academy award for  lm- editing in 1984.
advanced	they are the darkness seekers – and they are growing in number. on black fell, looking down on northumberland’s beautiful kielder water reservoir, a group of people wait in a car park next to a strange wooden building with a minimalist design beamed down from the future. this is kielder observatory, the centre of britain’s nascent astrotourism industry. and those waiting outside were the lucky ones. many more had applied for a night of stargazing at the observatory but numbers are strictly limited.inside, next to a woodburner and under dimmed lights, the observatory’s founder and lead astronomer, gary fildes, a former bricklayer with tarzan hair, delivers a pep talk to his colleagues and volunteers. the team discusses the prospect of seeing the northern lights but fildes is doubtful. instead, they decide to train their powerful telescopes on jupiter and venus and later to pick out stars such as capella and betelgeuse. an additional attraction is the appearance of the international space station.“remember,” fildes tells his team, “it’s about interaction, it’s about entertainment, it’s about inspiring people.” he puts on some music. pink floyd, the jam, the pogues. “by 9.30, the sky is going to be sexy,” fildes says. “it’s going to be epic.”fildes, 49, is at the forefront of the uk’s burgeoning astrotourism industry. the pivotal moment for northumberland came in 2013 when the entire national park housing hadrian’s wall, along with kielder water and forest park, some 1,500 sq km, was awarded dark sky park status, the only one in england. dark sky parks are rare. the 2013 star count revealed that only 5% of the uk population can see more than 31 stars on a good night.the tucson, arizona-based international dark-sky association (ida) confers the status only on places that take major steps to avoid light pollution. recipients must also prove their night skies are sufficiently dark. in northumberland dark sky park, as the area was rebadged, it is so dark that venus casts a shadow on the earth.duncan wise, visitor development officer for the northumberland national park authority, helped to spearhead the campaign for dark-sky status after the council for the protection of rural england found it was one of britain’s most tranquil places. “we tend to look at landscape as everything up to the horizon,” wise said. “but what about what’s above it?” wise and others spent years drawing up their submission to the ida, collecting reams of light readings and forming an alliance of local councils, parks’ bodies and community groups to produce an exterior lighting master plan that influences the construction of new developments in the area.their efforts have been vindicated. many of the 1.5 million who visit northumberland each year are now aware of its dark sky status. “we get a lot of people coming here to see the sky now,” says the man at the car-hire firm in newcastle. “they come in autumn and winter, when it’s darkest. good for the b&bs as they get business all year round now.” local hoteliers now issue guests with night-vision torches and put out deckchairs at night. those who have acquired some knowledge of astronomy can receive a badge confirming that their hotels are “dark sky friendly”.wise acknowledges that northumberland needs to do more to capitalize on its scarce resource and believes the region needs a couple more observatories to ensure that visitors will see what they came for. a £14m national landscape discovery centre, which he describes as the north’s answer to the eden project, will have an observatory when it is completed in a couple of years.fildes has grand designs. he is planning britain’s first “astrovillage”, one that would house the largest public observatory in the world and boast a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, a one-metre aperture telescope, and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes. the multimillion-pound project would feature a hotel and draw in 100,000 people a year, four times the number currently able to use the observatory. fildes is cryptic about his backers but believes the astrovillage will be a reality by 2018.however, northumberland faces competition. galloway forest park in scotland also has dark sky park status. since exmoor was designated europe’s first international dark sky reserve – one notch below dark sky park – in 2011, a range of local businesses offering stargazing breaks and safaris has sprung up. the uk will have to go some way to eclipse northern chile, which boasts more than a dozen tourist observatories and has some of the clearest skies in the world. the teide national park in tenerife is also becoming a major astrotourism destination.so, what is driving the desire to look upwards? the media have helped. tv presenters like brian cox have attracted a new generation of stargazers. “brian cox has made astronomy accessible,” says wise. “it’s no longer seen as the province of professors in studies with brass telescopes.” technology has also played a part. apps such as stellarium now turn smartphones into pocket-size planetariums. ultimately, though, fildes believes people are starting to appreciate what lies above. “if you had to build a visitor attraction from scratch, what could be better than the universe?”
advanced	margaret thatcher, the most dominant british prime minister since winston churchill in 1940 and a global champion of the late 20th-century free market economic revival, has died. the british government announced that she would receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours at st paul’s cathedral.the british prime minister, david cameron, who is cutting short his trip to europe to return to london following the news, said: “it was with great sadness that l learned of lady thatcher’s death. we’ve lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great briton.” he added: “as our first woman prime minister, margaret thatcher succeeded against all the odds, and the real thing about margaret thatcher is that she didn’t just lead our country, she saved our country, and i believe she will go down as the greatest british peacetime prime minister.”in a statement, president barack obama said, “here in america, many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with president reagan, reminding the world that we are not simply carried along by the currents of history – we can shape them with moral conviction, unyielding courage and iron will.”the first woman elected to lead a major western state, lady thatcher, as she became after the longest premiership since 1827, served 11 unbroken years at no 10 downing street.thatcher, who was 87, had been in declining health for some years, suffering from dementia. after a series of mini-strokes in 2002, thatcher withdrew from public life, no longer able to make the kind of waspish pronouncements that had been her forte in office – and beyond.her death was greeted with tributes from across the political spectrum.as labour sources announced the party would suspend campaigning in local elections as a mark of respect, its leader, ed miliband, said: “she will be remembered as a unique figure. she reshaped the politics of a whole generation. she was britain’s first woman prime minister. she moved the centre ground of british politics and was a huge figure on the world stage. the labour party disagreed with much of what she did and she will always remain a controversial figure. but we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength.”the deputy prime minister, nick clegg, said: “margaret thatcher was one of the defining figures in modern british politics. whatever side of the political debate you stand on, no one can deny that as prime minister she left a unique and lasting imprint on the country she served.”describing her as a political phenomenon, the former tory prime minister sir john major said: “her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.”the “iron lady” proved a significant cold war ally of the us president ronald reagan in the final showdown with the soviet union, which broke up under reformist pressures led by mikhail gorbachev, a kremlin leader with whom thatcher famously declared she could “do business”. as a result, many ordinary voters in ex-soviet bloc states saw her as a bold champion of their liberty, a view widely shared across the spectrum of mainstream us opinion – though not at home or among key eu partners.thatcher was an unremarkable mid-ranking conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975. within a decade, she had become known around the world – both admired and detested – for her pro-market domestic reforms and her implacable attitudes in foreign policy, including her long-running battle with the ira, which almost managed to murder her when it placed a bomb in the grand hotel, brighton, in 1984.at home, the emerging doctrine of thatcherism meant denationalization of state-owned industry – the new word “privatization” came into widespread use in many countries – and defeat of militant trade unionists, notably the national union of miners, whose year-long strike (1984– 85) was bitter and traumatic.boosted by the newly arrived revenues from britain’s north sea oil fields, thatcher had room to manoeuvre and change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies – including moderate members of her own party.but she also deployed her notorious “handbaggings”, or verbal attacks, in the european union to obtain a british rebate – “my money” as she called it. she was less successful in fending off the centralizing ambitions of the “belgian empire”, her description of the european commission, especially in the years when it was headed by the french socialist jacques delors.her allies in the tabloid press egged her on. and, as the british economy recovered from the severe recession that her monetarist medicine had inflicted on it – to tame the unions and cure inflation – she briefly seemed invincible.but untrammelled power, with the defeat or retirement of allies who had kept her in check, led to mistakes and growing unpopularity. when sir geoffrey howe, nominally her deputy, finally fell out with thatcher – chiefly over europe – his devastating resignation speech triggered a leadership challenge. thatcher made way for john major rather than risk losing to him in a ballot.in retirement, she wrote highly successful memoirs in two volumes and campaigned energetically on behalf of the thatcher foundation, which sought to promote her values around the world.
advanced	jmw turner, one of britain’s greatest painters, is to be the face of the new £20 note, following a nationwide vote.it will be the first time an artist has appeared on a british banknote, after the governor of the bank of england, mark carney, asked the public to nominate a deceased cultural figure they felt deserved the high honour.turner, renowned for his dramatic seascapes, beat off competition from 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, film-makers and actors put forward by 30,000 members of the public.the list included alfred hitchcock, alexander mcqueen, derek jarman, laura ashley, william morris and vanessa bell, which was then narrowed down by a panel of artists, critics and historians to a final choice of five.the final five – barbara hepworth, charlie chaplin, josiah wedgwood, william hogarth and turner – were selected on the basis of their “unquestioned” contribution to both the visual arts and british society as a whole, as well as their enduring influence.fittingly, the announcement of the new banknote was made at the turner contemporary gallery in margate, which stands on the former site of mrs booth’s lodging house, where turner would always stay when he visited. the announcement was made jointly by carney and the artist tracey emin, who grew up in the town.carney said it had been “so important to get this right and have a proper process that involved the public,” adding that, far from banknotes being purely a practical necessity, “if done properly, they can be a piece of art in everyone’s pocket”.“money is memory for a country and its people,” said the bank of england governor. “banknotes of the bank of england are a celebration of the uk’s heritage, a salute to its culture, a testament to its great achievements, including those of its most notable citizens. in short, money has not just economic value, it has cultural value as well.“the fact that we will have turner on the £20 note shows now that the british people are a nation of people who appreciate creativity and appreciate the arts,” said emin.the note will feature turner’s 1799 self-portrait, which currently hangs in tate britain, as well as one of his most recognizable works, the fighting temeraire, a tribute to the ship that played a distinguished role in nelson’s victory at the battle of trafalgar in 1805.emblazoned on the note will also be a quote from the artist – “light is therefore colour” – as well as his signature, taken from his will, in which he bequeathed many of his works to the nation.the new £20 note, which replaces the one featuring social philosopher and economic theorist adam smith, will enter circulation by 2020. this is the first time the public have been given a say over whose face appears on a british banknote.carney overhauled the process in 2013, following a high-profile campaign to ensure that women, apart from the queen, remained on banknotes, after the bank decided to phase out the elizabeth fry £5 note.historical figures were first introduced onto banknotes in 1970. turner joins winston churchill and jane austen as the significant figures who will feature on the new polymer notes – a plastic-type material that the new notes will all be made from – churchill on the £5 and austen on the £10 note. following in the footsteps of florence nightingale and elizabeth fry, the pride and prejudice author is only the third woman to be the face of british currency.turner was born in 1775 in london, the son of a barber, and he entered the royal academy schools at the age of 14. it was 1786, when he was sent to margate, that his love affair with painting and drawing the north-east kent coast began. he would return to that coast throughout his life and it was where he painted some of his most dramatic oils and watercolours, describing its skies as “the loveliest in all europe”.turner was a particularly prolific artist, producing more than 550 oil paintings and 2,000 watercolours over his lifetime. his life was also the subject of a film, in 2014, by mike leigh, with timothy spall taking on the role of the complex artist.victoria pomery, the director of turner contemporary, said: “the decision to celebrate jmw turner, one of the greatest technical pioneers in the history of british art, is extraordinary, not least because it has proven by a public vote that turner is the nation’s favourite artist. brilliantly, it is an official acknowledgment of the immense historical value of the visual arts to the uk.“but it is also a stark reminder that we must place increasing value on our future as a nation of creative minds. we must invest to support the next great artists and innovators.”
advanced	an international agreement to improve safety in bangladesh’s clothing factories is facing the threat of legal action as factory owners demand compensation for the cost of closures and repair work. with some repair programmes expected to take months, factory owners say they cannot shoulder the costs of paying staff while factories are closed, alongside the expense of some major works needed to ensure buildings are safe. the building overhauls are being carried out in the wake of the collapse of the rana plaza complex in the capital of bangladesh, dhaka, in 2013, in which 1,138 people were killed.the problems come as hundreds of bangladeshi clothing factories per month are inspected for firesafety and structural problems under the accord on fire and building safety in bangladesh, which is backed by over 170 international brands, including primark and marks & spencer, and international trade unions, including industriall.the owner of one dhaka-based factory, softex cotton, has threatened legal action against the accord after his factory was closed down due to structural problems, prompting a demand for a reported $100m in compensation.another factory owner, who declined to be named, said that once a factory closed its doors, even for a few months, it would lose orders and close permanently: “there is no such thing as temporary closure,” he said. the factory owner said that the accord agreement had “pussyfooted” around the issue of who paid for factory closures amid efforts to get as many brands as possible to sign up to a deal in the wake of the rana plaza disaster. he said there was no clear process in place to handle the costs involved.jenny holdcroft, policy director for industriall, which has been closely involved in the accord, said that the agreement ensured that factories would not lose orders during closure because brands had committed to maintain orders with suppliers for two years.while 12 factories have been identified so far by the accord as needing significant work, holdcroft said many of those only needed partial closure in order to reduce stress on the building so production could continue on other floors. the accord also legally binds brands to ensure that workers are paid during factory closures. she said the detail on who would make payments had been left open in order to ensure that all those factory owners who could afford to pay for repairs and compensation for workers made the necessary contribution.“this was always going to be a topic of negotiation. brands don’t want to commit to paying so that rich factory owners who have just pocketed the profits and not been spending on their factories for years continue to do so. there was obviously going to be disruption. if there was no disruption, there would be no change,” she said. a spokesman for the accord said negotiations over payments and even legal action would not hold up its work to improve safety in factories.however, pressure on the accord to contribute to the payment of displaced workers has ratcheted up after a rival factory-safety group backed by us retailers including walmart and gap, the alliance for bangladesh worker safety, set aside $5m to help pay factory workers for up to two months while work is carried out on the buildings it has identified as needing improvement. it has, so far, identified five factories in four buildings where production needed to be suspended.“the alliance is sharing the workers’ salary along with entrepreneurs so now there is a big confusion. we had a big meeting with the accord to make them understand they have to come forward or how will we help our workers?” said shaidullah azim, a director of the bangladeshi garment manufacturers and exporters association.
advanced	tigers are more numerous in nepal than at any time since the 1970s, a new census has revealed, giving conservationists hope that the big cats, whose numbers have been dropping across south asia for 100 years, can be saved.the number of wild royal bengal tigers in nepal has increased to 198 – a 63.6% rise in five years – the government survey showed. “this is very encouraging,” said maheshwar dhakal, an ecologist with nepal’s department of national parks and wildlife conservation.the census is based on the examination of pictures from more than 500 cameras placed in five protected areas and three wildlife corridors. more than 250 conservationists and wildlife experts worked on the survey, which cost about £250,000. dhakal said that a parallel survey was conducted in india and the results from both countries will be published later in 2013. “it will take a few more months for india, which now has 1,300 big cats in several huge protected areas, to finalize the data,” he added. nepal has pledged to double the population of tigers by the year 2022 from 121 in 2009 when the last systematic tiger count took place.increasing prosperity in asia has pushed up prices for tiger skins and the body parts used in traditional chinese medicines. international gangs pay poor local nepali significant sums to kill the cats. the skin and bones are handed to middlemen, who pass easily through the porous border to india, where the major dealers are based.one major problem is complicity between senior officials and mafia networks involved in the trade. conservation experts credit the increase in numbers to the effective policing of national parks, stronger anti-poaching drives and better management of tiger habitats in nepal, where forests cover 29% of the land. but they say nepal needs to do more to protect the habitat and animals on which tigers prey so the big cats have enough space to roam and food to eat.as the number of tigers has increased over the years, so have incidents of conflict with villagers. seven people were killed in attacks by tigers around national parks in 2012 compared to four in 2011, park officials said. villagers are also seeking better protection. “the government is making conservation plans for tigers. but it should also come up with plans to protect people from tigers,” krishna bhurtel, a local village headman in chitwan, told nepali newspaper nagarik. wildlife authorities captured a tiger in chitwan after it killed two people, including a villager who was pulled from his bed in may.thousands of tigers once roamed the forests in bangladesh, india and nepal. but their numbers have dropped to about 3,000, a 95% drop over a century. chitwan national park in central nepal has the highest number of adult tigers, with 120, followed by bardiya national park (50) and shukla phanta wildlife reserve (17).diwakar chapagain, who heads a world wildlife fund nepal unit that monitors wildlife trade, said tiger skins were in demand in tibet, where well-heeled people use them as festival costumes.in nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins in front of stuffed tigers for special occasions. some affluent nepali have mounted tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms. tiger bones are in high demand for use in traditional chinese medicines. “the trade in tiger parts is lucrative and fetches thousands of dollars in illegal markets,” chapagain said, highlighting the threat tigers face.
advanced	the mass collection of telephone records by government surveillance programmes poses a clear threat to the personal privacy of ordinary citizens, according to us researchers who used basic phone logs to identify people and uncover confidential information about their lives.armed with anonymous “metadata” on people’s calls and texts, but not the content of the communications, two scientists at stanford university worked out individuals’ names, where they lived and the names of their partners. but that was not all.the same data led them to uncover potentially sensitive information about some individuals. one man was found to own a rifle, while another had recently been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. other data pointed to a new pregnancy and a person with multiple sclerosis.the results highlight the extraordinary power of telephone metadata – the number called, when and for how long – particularly when it is paired with public information available from services such as google, yelp and facebook. the value of the data, which is not subject to the same legal protections as the content of people’s communications, has long been recognized by the security services. as stewart baker, the former general counsel at the us national security agency (nsa), put it in the aftermath of edward snowden’s revelations: “metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody’s life.”patrick mutchler, a computer security researcher at stanford, said that while the power of metadata was understood by those gathering the information, the public was largely in the dark because so few published studies have revealed how rich the data is. “that makes it difficult for people with strong opinions about these programmes to fight them. now, we have hard evidence we can point to that didn’t exist in the past,” he said.for the study, the researchers signed up 823 people who agreed to have metadata collected from their phones through an android app. the app also received information from their facebook accounts, which the scientists used to check the accuracy of their results. in all, the researchers gathered metadata on more than 250,000 calls and over 1.2m texts.analysts who logged into the nsa’s metadata-gathering system were initially allowed to examine data up to three hops away from an individual. a call from the target individual’s phone to another number was one hop. from that phone to another was two hops. and so on. the records available to analysts stretched back for five years. the collection window has now been restricted to two hops and 18 months at most.writing in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences, mutchler describes how, on a shoestring budget, he and fellow graduate student, jonathan mayer, uncovered a wealth of personal information, some of it sensitive, about people who took part in the study. through automatic and manual searches, they identified 82% of people’s names. the same technique gave them the names of businesses the people had called. when these were plotted on a map, they revealed clusters of local businesses, which the scientists speculated surrounded the person’s home address. in this way, they named the city people lived in 57% of the time, and were nearly 90% accurate in placing people within 50 miles of their home. mutchler believes some of the misses came from people not updating their facebook page when they moved out of their parents’ home, for example, to go to college.the scientists next delved into more personal territory. using a simple computer program to analyse people’s call patterns, they inferred who among the study volunteers was in a relationship. once they knew the owner of a particular number had a partner, identifying the significant other was easy, they report.for the final part of the study, the researchers delved even deeper, to see what sensitive information they could glean from telephone metadata. they gathered details on calls made to and from a list of organizations, including hospitals, pharmacies, religious groups, legal services, firearms retailers and repair firms. from these, they pieced together some extraordinary vignettes from people’s lives.the metadata from one person in the study showed they had a long call from a cardiology centre, spoke briefly with a medical laboratory, answered a number of short calls from a local pharmacy and then made calls to a hotline for abnormal heart-rate monitoring devices. another participant made frequent calls to a local gun supplier that specialized in semiautomatic rifles and later placed a number of long calls to the customer support hotline run by a major gun manufacturer that produced the rifles. the metadata from two others suggested one had multiple sclerosis and the other had just become pregnant.“all of this should be taken as an indication of what is possible with two graduate students and limited resources,” said mutchler, who argues that the findings should make policymakers think twice before authorizing mass surveillance programmes. “large-scale metadata surveillance programmes, like the nsa’s, will necessarily expose highly confidential information about ordinary citizens,” the scientists write, adding: “to strike an appropriate balance between national security and civil liberties, future policymaking must be informed by input from relevant sciences.”ross anderson, professor of security engineering at cambridge university, said the study provided numbers that discussions can now be based on. “with the right analytics running over nationscale communications data, you can infer huge amounts of sensitive information on everyone. we always suspected that, of course, but here’s the data.”
advanced	our new international survey across 33 countries shows just how wrong the world is about a range of key social realities.british people think the top 1% wealthiest households own 59% of their countryõs wealth, when they actually òonlyó own 23%. americans think that 33% of their population are immigrants, when in fact it is only 14%.brazilians think the average age in their country is 56, when it is only 31. russians think that 31% of their politicians are women, when it is only 14%.in britain, people think that an extraordinary 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%. in india, the online population think 60% of the whole country also has internet access, when in fact only 19% do.why are people across the world so often so clueless about these realities?it is partly that we just struggle with basic maths and some of us clearly misunderstand the questions or interpret them differently. for example, most countries hugely overestimate how many people do not af liate themselves with a religion: across the 33 countries, 37% do not, according to respondents, but the average is actually just 18%. this will be partly because we will be thinking of how many people practise their religion, rather than what they put on census forms. people also take mental shortcuts, where they grab for easily available information even if it doesnõt quite  t the question. our huge overestimates of the rural populations in most countries will be affected by how much of the physical landmass rural areas make up, rather than a careful calculation of how unoccupied it generally is. in daniel kahnemanõs terms, answers to these sorts of questions are classic examples of òfastó thinking, rather than òslowó.we are tied to our own perspective and struggle to imagine the variety in our countries, as highlighted by our indian sampleõs massively overestimating their populationõs access to the internet. our study was mostly carried out through an online survey ð and, in developing countries, this will be representative of a more af uent, connected group rather than the population as a whole. in some ways, we may have expected this more educated sample to get closer to reality ð those with higher education levels tend to be more accurate on these types of questions. but what we  nd, throughout the study, is that people grossly generalize from their own situations, forgetting how unrepresentative they are.we suffer from what social psychologists call òemotional innumeracyó when estimating realities: this means we are sending a message about what is worrying us as much as trying to get the right answers. cause and effect run both ways, with our concern leading to our misperceptions as much as our misperceptions creating our concern.for britain, this is likely to be part of the explanation for peopleõs huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own, how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when it is really only 13%, according to of cial estimates). people are worried about the concentration of wealth, the housing pressures facing young people and immigration levels, and this is re ected in them overstating the scale of the issues. but, the survey suggests there are also some issues where people are not as worried as they should be. for example, most countries hugely underestimate how much of their population is overweight or obese. the worst case is saudi arabia, where people think only 28% are, when 71% are. britons think it is 44%, when it is actually nearly half as much again ð 62% are either overweight or obese.and, in many ways, it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study. the top 1% in russia own 70% of the nationõs wealth, while the top 1% in new zealand only own 18%. half of italians aged 25-34 still live with their parents, when it is only 4% in norway. the average age in india is 27; it is 47 in japan. only 10% of politicians are women in brazil, hungary and japan, when 44% are in sweden. when the reality is so strange and varied, it is no wonder weõre so wrong.
advanced	we may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm back to the future ii, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched. experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally altering the transportation landscape. òitõs a very dynamic time,ó said robert puentes, of the brookings institutionõs metropolitan policy program think- tank. òthereõs a focus on a tighter connection between the role of transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people.óas the average us commute lengthens and the countryõs infrastructure ages badly, cities across the us are being forced to rede ne what transportation is. increasingly, urban planners, transportation experts and scientists are realizing that old auto-centric models focused on easing traf c congestion arenõt enough to tackle issues like population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now, more than ever, an integral component of a cityõs larger sustainability efforts.big us cities like los angeles, seattle and chicago are working to make better use of their streets by adding more bus lanes, augmenting pedestrian walkways and expanding their rail options, while at the same time working with the private sector on advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment, essentially making transportation intelligent. òthe most sustainable places to live are those places that have multi-modal transport systems,ó puentes said. òyou canõt be a global competitive city if you donõt have a robust transportation network.óhere are three of the key trends that experts predict will shape the transportation industry over the coming years. connectivity the rise of ride-sharing services like uber and lyft ð essentially taxis booked at the click of a smartphone button ð and apps like waze, which uses real-time traf c data to  nd the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people get around and affecting the very way in which traf c moves through a city. communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era, according to allan clelland, an expert on transportation technology.according to a recent study from the uclaõs institute of transportation studies, vehicle travel has declined among millennials ð individuals born roughly between the early 1980s and early 2000s ð compared to previous generations. according to the study, those born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives.meanwhile, those still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to waze. experts say the traf c app has eased congestion on motorways and reduced travel times for drivers but also led to a problematic rise in cars moving through residential neighbourhoods. this has angered residents, who claim the increased traf c on their quiet roads reduces their quality of life.this trend could continue as vehicle-to-vehicle data communication, as well as communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure, grows. currently, a traf c light can detect when a car is approaching but thatõs about it. companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.automation driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. however, the partial automation of cars is already underway. alexandre bayen of the university of california expects automation will progress in stages:  rst, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: essentially, vehicles that are connected electronically and travel in single  le.the idea of a fully automated transportation system is intriguing because it has the potential to improve safety by removing human error and increase the ef ciency of car owners, who can get on with other tasks during a long commute. it can also help reduce carbon emissions and traf c congestion and allow more people access to cars. but, even if driverless technology were ready to hit the roads now, it would take a long time to get fully automated given the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.to see what driverless cars might look like in action, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.environmental concern as the world races to avoid catastrophic climate change, and countries, states and cities work to meet ambitious emissions goals, these policies could also have a big impact on the future of transportation, spurring everything from zero- and low-emission vehicles to apps that encourage more walking, biking and carpooling.sharon feigon, executive director of the shared use mobility center, envisages a future where a person can use a transit pass that gives them access to numerous modes of transport in a given day. if their train is delayed, for instance, they can access a city bike, take a shuttle or rent a vehicle through a car share programme using the same pass. òweõre going to see these systems packaged together and make it as easy as possible to connect them up with each other so people can transfer seamlessly between them,ó she said.when considering the future of transportation, itõs also important to keep in mind why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. technologies and trends that reduce the need for those trips ð say, virtual meetings or telecommuting ð could also have a big impact on transportation.there was a time when the idea of a  ying car represented the height of innovation but the technologies being imagined and developed now could be seen as even more sophisticated ð and more useful in tackling the social and environmental threats that we face over the coming decades.ó
advanced	europe is to become the first place in the world to force ‘real-world’ emissions tests on car makers, opening up a new front in the fight to tackle air pollution. new regulations will introduce the tests to reveal what cars’ emissions are like when driving on roads and in traffic rather than in ideal, laboratory-like conditions, as is currently the case.green lit by european commission vice president, frans timmermans, the tests are designed to enforce a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre, a level met by only one car out of 16, according to researchers. other countries, such as china and korea, which are also considering real-world emissions tests, will be watching what happens next closely.pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and particulates are thought to be responsible for at least one quarter of the 29,000 annual pollution-related deaths in the uk alone. that figure is likely to rise, when the committee on the medical effects of air pollutants publishes what it calls “strengthening evidence” of damage to public health from nitrogen oxide emissions later in 2015.but the current ‘new european drive cycle’ laboratory test for measuring these emissions is a quarter of a century old and has been outpaced by technological developments in the car industry. studies have shown that the results of lab techniques to measure car emissions can easily be fixed by using techniques such as taping up doors and windows to minimize air resistance, driving on unrealistically smooth roads and testing at improbably high temperatures. campaigners say that car makers also use tricks such as programming vehicles to go into a low emissions mode when their front wheels are spinning and their back wheels are stationary, as happens in such lab experiments.“the commission is finalizing a proposal to introduce a new emissions testing procedure that will allow proper assessment of the vehicles in real driving,” said lucia caudet, a commission spokesperson. the proposal still needs approval from other commissioners and a technical committee but “we don’t expect any major internal hurdles,” a european union (eu) source added.“one key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 citizens annually is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars, causing many times more pollution on the road,” said greg archer, the clean vehicles manager for transport and environment. “the development of a new, real-world driving emission test is an important step forward in tackling urban air pollution. eu states should now support the commission’s proposals and ignore the whingeing from car makers that the rules are too tough.”according to research by the international council on clean transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg/km standard, with some models running at 22 times above the recommended limit. only one car out of 16 met the 80g target. around one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport – mostly diesel – and, in urban areas, concentrations can rise as high as 64%, european environment agency figures indicate.campaigners say that the car industry has tried to delay reforms to car test cycles but industry groups deny this, arguing that a five-year lead-time is necessary for technical and economic reasons. “real driving emissions (rde) is a totally new regulation that will force significant emission control hardware changes that may be demanded in the middle of a vehicle’s production lifetime,” said cara mclaughlin, a spokesperson for the european automobile manufacturers association (acea). “however, acea fully accepts that rde will apply to new types of cars from september 2017.”in an unusual move, the car association sent timmermans a draft regulation of their own for him to consider, after eu representatives finally agreed a regulation to implement the nitrogen oxide limits with beefed-up road trials and strict monitoring of exhaust fumes. acea’s draft regulation would have covered fewer pollutants and further delayed the regulation’s phased introduction until 2020. test distances would have been shortened from 1,300m to below 700m, minimum temperatures would have been raised from -7c to -3c and more rural roads would have been used. “the lobbyists were all over this,” archer said. “this was a real attempt at subversion of the legislative process.”after timmerman’s apparent rejection of the acea proposal, the regulation will now pass to commissioners for a rubber stamp, and member states for final amendments, before an expected introduction in september. by 2017, the first real-world car emissions tests are expected to begin in earnest. with a similar battle already looming over the testing of co2 emissions for cars at the end of 2015 – and with comparable debates in other countries – the introduction of the eu’s new emissions tests will be watched closely.
