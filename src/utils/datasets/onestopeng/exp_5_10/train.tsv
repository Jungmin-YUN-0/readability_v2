intermediate	hundreds of young cubans are using the first known free, open-access internet service in the communist island nation. it has been made possible by one of cuba’s most famous artists. a small cultural centre in the capital city, havana, has suddenly become a rare source of free wi-fi. the internationally known cuban artist kcho is providing the service. perhaps more surprisingly, the service has been approved by the state-owned telecommunications company, etecsa.people say the service is very slow, especially when the centre gets crowded. but, in a country where only about 5% of the population has unrestricted access to the internet, a facility that is both free of charge and free of restrictions is being welcomed.the chance to click on international news websites, communicate with friends and family overseas and use sites like facebook and twitter has created a lot of excitement. “i come as often as i can,” said adonis ortiz, 20, while video-chatting with his father, who lives in the us and whom he has not seen in nine years.as diplomatic and trade relations between the us and cuba improve, american tech giants such as google and apple are expected to enter the cuban market as soon as they are permitted. in the meantime, cuba has installed a high-speed fibre-optic cable under the sea from venezuela and internet users have some access to chinese equipment.another estimate, that a quarter of cubans have access to the internet – still one of the lowest rates in the western hemisphere – in fact measures residents who use a restricted domestic intranet that only features certain websites and has limited email.kcho has offered the public admission to his own personal internet connection. but this is not the action of a counter-revolutionary or free-market rebel. kcho was probably chosen as the acceptable face of a government recognizing the inevitable attractions of the internet.kcho, who has close ties to the cuban government, announced that his actions had been approved by the ministry of culture. the artist said he wanted to encourage cubans to familiarize themselves with the internet. “it’s only possible if you are determined and if you absorb the costs,” kcho told the associated press. “it is expensive but the benefit is tremendous. i have something that is great and powerful. i can share it and i am doing so.”kcho’s real name is alexis leiva machado. he became famous internationally for his painting, sculpture and drawings after winning the grand prize at a prominent art biennial in south korea. he is currently preparing for the havana biennial in may. born on one of cuba’s islands, he is known for contemporary art with rustic, seaside and patriotic themes and imagery.in the centre’s courtyard, tech-savvy young people lounge throughout the day or just sit outside when it’s crowded, tapping away on laptops and tablets or glued to their smartphones.cuba has some of the lowest connectivity rates on the planet, with dial-up accounts closely restricted and at-home broadband almost unheard of except in the case of foreigners – they pay hundreds of dollars a month for the service in a country where the average salary is between $17 and $20 a month. kcho is believed to be paying $900 a month to provide the free wi-fi.since 2013, cuban authorities have opened hundreds of internet salons, where an hour online costs $4.50, at speeds far lower than those at kcho’s studio of around 2mbps. a 2014 report found average internet connectivity speeds to be around 10.5mbps in the us and 23.6mbps in world-leading south korea. globally, the average was about 3.9mbps.with dozens of users at one time, the signal strength of kcho’s wi-fi is diluted. one user said he sometimes visits in the middle of the night, when nobody else is around, and finds it to be unbelievably fast.
intermediate	lego’s profits rose strongly in the first half of 2014, helped by the success of its lego movie, which has stormed box offices in the us and uk.the danish toy firm’s sales rose across europe, the americas and asia as children bought products linked to the film. the film, released in february 2014, took more than $250m in the us and £31m in the uk by the first weekend in april.the movie cost about $60m to make and has been described as an almost perfect piece of marketing. it is entertaining and aimed at consumers who are likely to go out and buy the company’s products.lego’s finance director, john goodwin, said that the lego movie products had a positive effect on profits during the first half of 2014. they are now waiting to see how the products will continue to develop after the launch of the movie on dvd in the second half of 2014.jørgen vig knudstorp, lego’s chief executive, said: “it is a very satisfactory result that shows our significant growth in recent years in a tough economic environment. the result for the first half of 2014 is an outcome of our ability to develop, launch and distribute lego products, which children all over the world put at the top of their wishlists.”lego, based in the small town of billund, started producing its plastic bricks in 1949 and became a popular and well-known children’s toy around the world by the 1970s. but the group lost its way and was on the brink of collapse in 2003. knudstrop took over as chief executive, ending 70 years of family rule, and got rid of hundreds of surplus products. he then refocused the business on its bricks.the company opened its first factory in china in april and opened an office in shanghai to start expansion into the world’s second-biggest economy.nan
intermediate	the controversial auction of a banksy mural that disappeared from the wall of a north london shop was dramatically stopped just moments before it was going to be sold.slave labour is a spray-painted artwork showing a child making british flags and is seen as a critical social commentary on last year’s diamond jubilee. it was expected to sell for about $700,000 in a sale of street and contemporary art in florida.but auctioneer frederic thut, the owner of the fine arts auction miami art house, who had refused all week to give the name of the seller, announced that slave labour, together with a second work by the secretive british street artist, had been removed from sale at the auction.he would not give a reason, but community leaders in haringey, london, who led a campaign to stop the sale of the artwork that was removed from the wall of a poundland shop in wood green, were extremely happy“one of our two demands was that it doesn’t sell and the other was that we get it back again, so we’re halfway there,” said alan strickland, a haringey councillor.“i will be writing to the auction house to clarify what happened and what will happen next, but for now we are really pleased that a community campaign in london has had an impact in the us. it’s a real victory for the people.”claire kober, leader of haringey council, wrote to arts council england and the mayor of miami, tomás regalado, to ask them to stop the sale, but it appears the decision to remove the item from sale came from the gallery owners.several hours after the auction, the auction house said it had persuaded the owners of the two banksys to remove them from the sale. “although there are no legal issues whatsoever regarding the sale of lots six and seven by banksy, faam convinced its sellers to remove these lots from the auction.”critics have accused the auction house of buying and selling stolen property but thut said that the seller, who he described as a “well known collector”, was the rightful owner and that the sale was legal.he added that his gallery had received many emails and phone calls from the uk, but said he supported selling the two pieces of artwork because it would preserve them.the second banksy to be auctioned, a 2007 artwork called wet dog that was removed from a bethlehem wall and is estimated to be worth up to $800,000, was removed from the auction house’s online catalogue, but slave labour was still listed for sale right up to the 3pm start time.thut said the two pieces, supplied to him by separate owners, neither of them british, were important works in the street art scene and deserved buyers “whose first interest is in art and its preservation”.a spokesperson for poundland said it had no idea who removed the 4ft x 5ft mural from the side of one of its shops in london.banksy himself has not commented on the slave labour controversy, but he has previously condemned people who have tried to sell his artwork. he spoke out before five of his pieces were going to be sold at a 2011 auction in new york. none found a buyer.stephan keszler, the dealer at that auction, believes selling banksy’s works without his permission is legitimate.“he does something on other people’s property without asking. the owner of the property can do whatever they want with it,” keszler said.nannan
intermediate	“i got a dyson vacuum cleaner but i don’t even know if i want it. i just picked it up,” louise haggerty, a 56-year-old hairdresser and waitress, said at the end of her trip to the black friday sales at one o’clock in the morning. “it was mental in there. it was crazy. it was absolutely disgusting, disgusting.”haggerty went to a 24-hour sainsbury’s supermarket in north-east london with a friend. she hoped to buy a bargain flat-screen tv. “but so many people pushed in the queue that we didn’t have a chance,” she said. “the poor woman who was second in the queue was pushed out by a crowd of youths. she didn’t get anything. people were behaving like animals – it was horrible,” she said. “i only saw two security guards.”frustrated when she was unable to buy a 40” tv reduced from £299.99 to £149.99, haggerty rushed to pick up a vacuum cleaner, reduced from £319.99 to £159.99. “i don’t even know how much it costs; i don’t know even know if i’m going to buy it. i just wanted something,” she said. “there are lads in there with three, four, five tellies. it’s not fair.”one of those lads was andy blackett, 30, who had two trolleys full of bargains. “i got two coffee makers, two tablets, two tvs and a stereo,” he said. “i couldn’t tell you the prices but i know they’re bargains.” but his friend henry fischer wasn’t as successful. “someone snatched my telly from me – it’s because i’m the smaller one.”blackett, fischer and some friends had driven to sainsbury’s at 12.45am after leaving the “bedlam” of a tesco 24-hour supermarket, where the black friday sale started at midnight. “tesco was scary so we came here instead,” blackett said.more than a dozen police officers went to another tesco store because scuffles began between eager and frustrated shoppers. customers removed cardboard hoardings that were holding back sale items until midnight. tesco delayed the sale of its most popular sale items – tvs – for almost an hour until police brought the situation under control. one officer criticized the manager for not providing enough security and suggested the sale should be stopped altogether.police intervened at several other stores just before the doors opened at midnight. meanwhile, manchester police said that at least two people had been arrested at black friday sales events. south wales police also received a number of calls from staff at tesco stores after they became “concerned due to the number of people who had turned up to sale events”.tv sales at the tesco store began just before 1am. one of the first purchasers of a flat-screen tv was james alled. he bought two and was already trying to sell one of them to someone further down the queue. “i bought them for £250. i’ll sell it to you for £350, £300 cash,” he said. further back in the queue, christine ball, 62, wasn’t impressed. “i got here at 10.15pm and i’m further back now than when i got here,” she said. “these people don’t know what a queue is.”ball had not heard of the us-inspired black friday sales until now, like most of the shoppers. she said she had come out especially to buy her grandson a tv for christmas. “not one of those massive ones; just a normal one at £100 or so,” she said. in her basket was a pint of milk and a loaf of bread. “telly, milk and bread – the necessities,” she said.mel mehmet, 23, had been to black friday sales in 2013 and had expected queues but she said the atmosphere in tesco scared her this time. “it’s crazy having the sale at midnight – the police must have more important things to do at night than come to sales. we’re going to pc world first thing – their sale starts at 8am.”
intermediate	a lonely old man living on the moon is the unusual focus of john lewis’s 2015 christmas advert.there is increasing hype around john lewis’s seasonal ad, which has come to mark the beginning of the christmas shopping season for many. the department store will aim to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for age uk. it will also encourage staff and customers to join up with their local branch of the charity to care for elderly people who might be alone over the holiday.the department store has spent £7m on a campaign that ranges from the tv ad to a smartphone game and merchandise, including glow-in-the-dark pyjamas, as well as making areas that look like the surface of the moon in 11 of their stores.after two years of successful ads with cuddly animals – a bear and hare, then a penguin – this time, the store is tugging at the heartstrings with a story of a young girl, lily, who spots an old man living in a shack on the moon through her telescope. the determined child tries sending him a letter and firing a note via bow and arrow, before floating him a present of a telescope tied to balloons, which finally allows them to make contact.the ad’s message is: “show someone they’re loved this christmas”, which echoes age uk’s own campaign: “no one should have no one at christmas”. profits from three products – a mug, gift tag and card – will go to the charity.rachel swift, head of marketing at john lewis, said that people talk about the charity at this time of year and the ad makes you think about someone who lives on your street that might not see anybody.the campaign features the oasis track half the world away reinterpreted by norwegian artist aurora.the ad cost £1m to make. the moon scenes were shot at the warner bros studios, where the harry potter films were made, and the specially built set was created by one of the team behind the latest star wars film, the force awakens.as in the last few years, john lewis has drummed up interest in their most recent ad with a teaser campaign on tv and social media using the hashtag #onthemoon. a full moon will fall on christmas day 2015 – a complete coincidence, according to swift.in 2014, the retailer also spent £7m on a campaign with a realistic animated penguin and a young boy playing together to the tune of john lennon’s real love, sung by british singer-songwriter tom odell. it had drummed up 22m views on youtube by the first week of january – more than the 16.6m views of sainsbury’s ad with first world war soldiers sharing a bar of chocolate, the uk’s second most popular ad of 2014.swift said that, despite the hype, john lewis had kept the same strategy for the last five years. “it’s all about thoughtful gifting and going the extra mile for someone you love at christmas,” she said. “we don’t go into it thinking, ‘this is going to be huge,’ just getting something right for the brand at this time of year and something we hope customers really love.”sarah vizard, news editor of trade journal marketing week, said john lewis appeared to have simplified efforts this time, with a lower-key presence in stores despite a growing number of competitors. “there are definitely a lot more brands doing christmas ads this year but i think a lot of those brands who tried to compete with john lewis by doing something emotional and creative have gone back to what you can buy in store,” she said. “john lewis still does the emotional piece the best. this campaign is another great way of communicating that in a way that customers can relate to. i think people will think it is really cute.”nannannannan
intermediate	scientists have connected the brains of two animals and allowed them to share sensory information. it is a major step towards what the researchers call the world’s first “organic computer”.the us team fitted two rats with devices called brain-to-brain interfaces that let the animals collaborate on simple tasks to earn rewards, such as a drink of water. in one important demonstration of the technology, the scientists used the internet to connect the brains of two rats separated by thousands of miles – one in north carolina, usa, and the other in natal, brazil.the researchers were led by miguel nicolelis, a pioneer of devices that allow paralyzed people to control computers and robotic arms with their thoughts. they say their latest work could make it possible for multiple brains to be connected to share information. “these experiments showed that we have established a sophisticated, direct communication connection between brains,” nicolelis said. “basically, we are creating what i call an organic computer.”the scientists first demonstrated that rats can share, and act on, each other’s sensory information by electrically connecting their brains via tiny grids of electrodes that reach the part of the brain that processes movement.the rats were taught to press a lever when a light went on above it. when they did the task correctly, they got a drink of water. to test the animals’ ability to share brain information, they put the rats in two separate compartments. only one compartment had a light above the lever. when the rat pressed the lever, an electronic version of its brain activity was sent directly to the other rat’s brain. in tests, the second rat responded correctly to the imported brain signals and pressed the lever 70% of the time.incredibly, the communication between the rats was two-way. if the receiving rat failed at the task, the first rat did not get the reward of a drink, and appeared to change its behaviour to make the task easier for its partner. in further experiments, the rats collaborated on a task that required them to tell the difference between narrow and wide openings using their whiskers.in the final test, the scientists connected rats on different continents and used the internet to send their brain activity back and forth. “even though the animals were on different continents, they could still communicate,” said miguel pais-vieira, the first author of the study. “this tells us that we could create a workable network of animal brains distributed in many different locations.”nicolelis said the team is now working on ways to connect several animals’ brains at once to solve more complex tasks. “we cannot even predict what might happen when animals begin interacting as part of a ‘brain-net’,” he said. “in theory, you could imagine that a combination of brains could find solutions that individual brains cannot achieve by themselves.”anders sandberg, who studies the ethics of neurotechnologies at oxford university, said the work was “very important” in helping to understand how brains encode information. but the potential future uses of the technology are much wider, said sandberg. “the main reason we are running the planet is that we are amazingly good at communicating and coordinating. without that, although we are very smart animals, we would not dominate the planet.”“i don’t think there’s any risk of supersmart rats from this,” he added. “there’s a big difference between sharing sensory information and being able to plan. i’m not worried about an invasion by smart rats.”very little is known about how people encode thoughts and how they might be sent to another person’s brain – so that will not happen any time soon. and much of what is in our minds is a “draft”, as sandberg calls it, of what we might do. “often, we don’t want to reveal those drafts, because that would be embarrassing and confusing. and we change a lot of those drafts before we act. most of the time i think we’d be very thankful not to be in someone else’s head.”
intermediate	sleep deprivation used to be a sign that you were busy and important and very much in demand. sleep was for wimps. now, however, arianna huffington’s the sleep revolution, a book that promises to completely change your life “one night at a time”, is a new york times best-seller.meanwhile, businesses have realized that they can make money from the sleep revolution. a whole range of businesses are reinventing where, when and how we sleep, as well as how much we’re prepared to pay for it. luxury hotels are offering “sleep retreats”; more than $1,000 gets you dinner and a movie about sleep. and, if you’re staying home, you can upgrade your bedroom with everything from a mattress cover with a sensor that monitors your sleep ($249) to a sleeping mask that monitors your brainwaves and lets you nap more efficiently ($299).sleep has not only become big business – it has made its way into corporations. a number of companies already have sleeping areas and huffington predicts that nap rooms in offices are going to become “as common as conference rooms” in the next two years. so, how did this happen? how did sleep, something humans have done since long before huffington, suddenly become so fashionable?many people these days find it normal to pay $10 for green juice and $34 for an indoor cycle class. and getting enough sleep fits into this kind of lifestyle. then, there’s wearable technology. our bodies have become machines that we monitor and optimize for greater efficiency and sleep has become another data set to be monitored. what huffington emphasizes about sleep, after all, is not that it rests you but that it restores you. sleep, she says, is the ultimate performance enhancer and getting eight hours of rest has become the ultimate status symbol.you know how arianna huffington gets her eight hours? well, she has “nine or so” assistants. huffington calls them her “a-team”. they do everything for her. they run her errands, plan her travel and load the huffington post on her computer in the morning. according to the new york times, most of the a-team can only survive about 12 months in the job because it’s so taxing. the low pay also means many of them take second jobs. basically, they don’t sleep so that huffington can … and can sell books about it.getting enough sleep isn’t just a question of valuing sleep enough to go to bed at the right time; it’s a question of going to bed in the right neighbourhood and in the right body. numerous studies show that you’re more likely to sleep badly if you’re poor. it’s hard to sleep if you’re worried about your safety or haven’t had enough to eat. it’s hard to sleep if you’re one of the 15 million american shift workers who work irregular hours. research has also found that there’s a black/white sleep gap. one study shows that white people sleep an average of 6.85 hours but african americans sleep an average of 6.05 hours. they also have a lower quality of sleep. researchers say this is partly due to the stress of racism.do you know who gets the most sleep and the best quality of sleep in america? rich white women. who are probably the same people huffington wrote her book for. huffington describes her promotion of sleep as a “revolution” but, really, it’s a rebranding. the very real sleep crisis isn’t that a few rich people think it’s a waste of time; the problem is the 99% who can’t afford to spend time sleeping.sleep may be a performance enhancer but it’s an inefficient one. the real prize is finding a way to negate sleep deprivation so humans can work on less sleep. unsurprisingly, the military is at the forefront of this research. in 2008, the pentagon published a report called “human performance”. it examined the possibility of a future in which soldiers could perform at their peak with only a couple of hours’ sleep. “imagine that you could make a human who slept for the same amount of time as a giraffe (1.9 hours per night). this would lead to a twofold decrease in the casualty rate. an enemy would need approximately 40% more soldiers to compensate for this advantage.”eventually, humans will find a way to remove the need for sleep completely. spending a third of your life unconscious won’t be a luxury anymore; it’ll be something only the poor will be forced to do. at that point, we may need a whole new sort of sleep revolution.
intermediate	a girl born today in the uk can expect to live nearly to the age of 82 on average and her brother will live to 78. they would have a longer life in andorra (85 and 79 respectively) but will live a little longer than in the us (81 and 76). if they lived in the central african republic, they would die in middle age (49 and 44). however, almost everywhere in the world, with the exception of countries such as lesotho, which have experienced hiv and violence, lifespans are lengthening. and the best news is that small children are much less likely to die than they were forty years ago. there has been a drop in deaths in under-fives of nearly 60%, from 16.4 million in 1970 to 6.8 million in 2010.this last statistic provides justification for the enormous project that the institute of health metrics and evaluation (ihme) in seattle has led over the past five years, involving nearly 500 researchers, to assess the global effects of disease. knowing how many children die and from what cause allows the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive. there are many lessons to be learnt from the enormous database they have put together, which will help global organizations and individual governments to better care for us all.the project was a big task and is not without controversy. ihme has been very radical in some of its methods. where they did not have death registries or medical records, for instance, they have taken evidence from verbal autopsies – deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family. the most surprising result has been the malaria figure. ihme said 1.2 million die of the disease every year – twice as many as previously thought. the big increase is in adult deaths. it is commonly believed that malaria kills mostly children under five.“the way i was taught as a doctor and everybody else is taught is that, in malarial areas, you become semi-immune as an adult,” said dr christopher murray, ihme director. “we originally went with that opinion but there has been a change as we have become more empirical, following the data. african doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot.” but, he adds, their fever could be something else. the findings have led to further studies.although margaret chan, director general of the world health organization, gave the ihme study a warm official welcome, some of the staff are cautious. “we need to be very careful in assessing the validity [of the figures],” said colin mathers, a senior scientist. “we need to wait to be persuaded by evidence.” his colleague dr tiers boerma, director of one who department, added: “people should understand that some of the numbers are very different and the who can’t go with any academic publication that states a different number.” however, said mathers, “ihme has pushed the envelope with some of these analyses and that is stimulating”. one of the main themes, said murray, was “incredibly rapid change in the main causes of death and the speed of that change is a lot faster than we expected it to be”.reduced fertility and longer life have led to a rise in the average age of the world’s population in a decade from 26 years old to almost 30. the change has been dramatic in latin america, for instance, where countries like brazil and paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010. that is a 35-year increase in the average age of death over four decades. “in a place like brazil, the speed of change is so fast that most institutions are not able to deal with it,” murray said.a second factor is the move outside africa from communicable diseases and the common causes of mother and baby deaths to what are sometimes termed “lifestyle” diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer – some of which have significant genetic triggers. that change has been particularly marked in latin america, the middle east and south-east and even south asia, he said.the third big finding was, murray said, “a surprise to us”. there is a lot of disability and it has a big effect on people who are living longer but not healthier lives. “the main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you,” he said. they were mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, and disorders, such as arthritis and lower back pain, anaemia, sight and hearing loss and skin disease. in addition, there was substance abuse. “the numbers for these are not going down over time,” he said. “we are making no progress in reducing these conditions.”
intermediate	it has mapped the world’s highest peaks, the ocean floor, the amazon rainforest and even shown us a bit of north korea. but google’s mission to map the world has mostly stayed away from the inhospitable arctic.now, however, google is starting what might be the most significant update to centuries of polar map making – and one it hopes will help provide a better understanding of life on the permafrost for millions of web users. google has flown a small team to iqaluit, the largest town in the canadian territory of nunavut. they have with them their warmest winter clothes, a stack of laptop computers and an 18kg telescopic camera that they can fix to their backpacks.helped by an inuit mapping expert, and followed around by curious locals, the team spent four days collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on baffin island what people across the globe who live in cities now take for granted.the town of 7,000 people will go on display via google’s popular street view application in july 2013.unlike more accessible parts of the world, which have been mapped using a special camera on a car roof, for google’s iqaluit project mappers walked the town’s snowpacked roads and crossed little-known trails, some of which are made of ice and disappear in the short summer months.the team also walked along part of a 15km dead-end road known as the road to nowhere, despite warnings about the risk from polar bears and other wildlife.john graham, mayor of iqaluit, understands the enthusiasm of the locals who followed google’s digital map makers while they worked. the street view project, he said, follows in the footsteps of the english explorer martin frobisher, who in 1576 sailed into the bay where iqaluit now is while searching for the northwest passage, and the 1941 flight of captain elliott roosevelt, an officer and son of the us president, which led to the site being chosen for a military airbase. his exploration led to the founding of the modern town of iqaluit.what google had already created on their existing map using satellite images was quite accurate, but they were missing one road that had been created in the past year.one difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office, not delivered to their address. putting the po box addresses on the map would mean the map would show all the companies, banks and schools in the same place, around the canada post building in the centre of town.about 30 inuit elders, business people and high-school pupils came one night to help correct such problems. they were provided with a laptop computer and shown how to make sure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up accurately on the map.the project is more than a novelty. arif sayani, the town’s director of planning, said the town would be able to use the maps as a promotional tool for those thinking of visiting or moving to the area. it may also speed up planning decisions in iqaluit.the project leader for google said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns. however, the high costs of moving people and equipment around the vast arctic territory means they might have to use cheaper methods in the future, for example, sending equipment to the area and asking volunteers to complete the map.nannannannannannan
intermediate	will we soon live in a world where drones deliver packages? if you believe amazon, the answer is òyesó. others are not so sure: we need to make more technical progress in this area but there is also the problem of public safety.amazon spokesman paul misener told a us congress hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place. the federal aviation authority (faa) will  nally have regulations on the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by june 2016. but the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines arenõt legal yet ð only drones up to 25kg will be legal. and the faa says that, if youõre going to crowd the skies with radio- controlled  ying robots, they must all use different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack.professor sajiv singh, who runs a cargo delivery company called nearearth, said that, to pilot a state-of-the-art drone, you simply give it some basic instructions: go to this altitude, perform this short task, go back home. but even short  ights from a mobile landing pad could cause serious logistical problems, he said.òtheyõre not going to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; theyõre going to deliver from a warehouse to the consumer, which will probably be an urban area or a suburban area,ó he said. òin those particular cases, there are going to be hazards that the vehicle is going to have to see. maybe there will be terrain that the map doesnõt know about. then, maybe thereõs construction equipment that wasnõt there before but is there now. maybe gps signals are blocked, in which case itõs going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.ó all these problems can be solved, he said ð but itõs dif cult.one major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks. òif you have an off-the-shelf uav [unmanned aerial vehicle], itõll just keep going and crash into the ground,ó said roboticist daniel huber.furthermore, òyou canõt do everything with a 25kg aircraftó, said jay mcconville, director of business development for unmanned systems at lockheed martin. òpeople in the aircraft business have to remind ourselves that the operator doesnõt really care about every little thing about the aircraft and wants instead to focus on the end result,ó he said. òoperators want to see vehicle status information; they want to see video on their handheld device or their laptop.óòtechnologically, most of the things that we need for this are in place,ó said huber. he is working on a program to allow drones to inspect infrastructure ð pipelines, telephone lines, bridges and so on. òweõve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and it will  y around that area and look at every surface and then report back.óhuber, who works on 3d systems imagery, said about amazon: òi have heard them say that many packages are lightweight ð a drone can carry a kilogram for 15 minutes. if you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood, it can deliver from that base. you need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have that distance.ó itõs one way, he said, of making sure the surrounding population is relatively safe. òthe larger you get, the more dangerous you get.óproblems with the use of drones can be solved in some very dramatic ways, huber said. at a recent conference, he said, a disaster relief drone company demonstrated a robot that could take off and, when it got tired, land on its own charging station and exchange its batteries.of course, safety is still a major concern ð singh says that, for a commercial aircraft to be allowed to  y, it has to prove a rate of one serious failure every one million hours. drones, he said, are a long way from that. òthe reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours,ó singh said. but they donõt consider an oil leak a catastrophic failure ð something has to fall out of the sky.part of the reason for this is that air travel is dangerous so standards are much higher. òif you  y commercial airlines, they often say, ôoh, a component has failed ð we have to go back to the gate,õó singh said. òand thatõs an established industry with 60 years of legacy! i hate to think that a drone might come down on a busy road.ó part of the solution, singh said, is planning for every situation: òif things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.ónan
elementary	a fifth of young adults in the uk are staying in the family home until they are at least 26 and a fifth are not paying any rent. a recent survey found that the percentage of adults who live at home was different in different parts of the country – it was less than 9% in the east midlands and more than double that in london, where house prices and rents are highest. many young people pay their parents some money to live at home but 20% pay nothing at all.young adults are suffering from low wages and high rents. the cost of renting is too much so young people who want to buy a house can’t save enough to get on the property ladder. recent research showed half of tenants were unable to save any money for a deposit and a quarter could only save £100 or less each month. mortgages are cheaper than ever before but people who have large deposits still get the best mortgages.as a result of this, more and more young adults are returning to the family home to save money. and, parents who cannot afford to give their children money for a deposit seem happy to let them live at home again. the survey found that 28% of adults live at home because they are trying to save for a deposit. but it also found that 30% are not saving any money.michael day, 30, who lives with his parents in bristol, says it’s difficult to save for a mortgage deposit when rents are so high. rents for a onebedroom home in the city are between £500 and £800 a month. buying a similar flat would cost about £130,000. “i don’t really want to move out to rent because it’s more than a mortgage but you need such a big deposit to get a mortgage.”sue green, who works for saga, a business that sells insurance to people over 50, said most parents did not think their children would live with them in their 20s or 30s. “most will be more than happy to have them in the family home rent-free because it might help their kids get on the property ladder sooner,” she said. “children who don’t pay rent may pay for other things like groceries or they may do odd jobs around the home.”angus hanton, of the intergenerational foundation, said older people caused the housing crisis and we should not blame younger people for staying at home. “the under-30s earn, on average, 20% less since the 2008 downturn. rents and car insurance have never been so high,” he said, “and many jobs – zero-hour and short-term contracts – turn younger workers into second-class citizens.”jenna gavin, 29, lives in the family home where she grew up. she works as a medical receptionist nearby so she wants to stay in the area. but renting a one-bedroom flat would cost more than £420 a month not including bills, which would use a lot of her earnings. “i don’t want to rent – i don’t want to spend all that money and have nothing at the end,” she said. “i’ve thought about buying and seen mortgage advisers but i just can’t borrow enough to get on the property ladder.”she is trying to save for a deposit. “it’s difficult to save enough money – even a 5% deposit is such a lot of money,” she said. her parents are happy not to ask her to pay rent. “they want me to try to save and i do other things – i buy food and i do things around the house.” she gets on with her parents and has the same room that she had when she was 14 but she said she had always imagined she would have her own home before she was 30.nannannan
elementary	thousands of people protested on australiaõs beaches against a shark cull in western australia. they asked the stateõs prime minister to stop the cull, and rspca australia and virgin atlantic owner richard branson criticized it. catching and killing sharks longer than three metres began after a number of shark attacks on western australiaõs coast. a 35-year-old surfer, who was killed in november 2013, was the sixth person to die from a shark attack in two years.but the whole of australia has had, on average, just one shark-related death a year for the last 50 years. kate faehrmann, of the sea shepherd conservation society, said, from a protest in perth, the state capital of western australia: òweõve always said that this idea wonõt work. drumlines, which they use to catch the sharks, kill sharks if theyõre one, two, three metres or more, and also dolphins, turtles and other things. thatõs why we donõt want the cull.óthousands of people protested on beaches in the cities of perth, sydney and adelaide, and at beaches in victoria and queensland. faehrmann said the protests showed that australians wanted sharks to be protected: òwhatõs amazing is that so many people in australia love sharks. this has shown that people are scared but thousands of people are coming out across the country to say, ôthatõs the sharksõ ocean. we respect them, we love them and we donõt want you to kill them.õ anthony joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharkõs mouth, said: òthe number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference.óthe state government will not say how many sharks they have killed, but some people say that sharks smaller than three metres were released after they were caught on drumlines,  oating drums  xed to the sea bed with bait on hooks underneath them. conservationists say there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, because no other cull has only used drumlines. researchers at the university of western australia say the increased number of shark attacks in the state may be because western australia has the fastest-growing population in australia, not because of a rising number of sharks.richard peirce, of the uk-based conservation charity, the shark trust, said that the cull would not work and could bring more predators towards the coast. òthe activity in western australia is adding to the human tragedy of shark attacks. it is very sad that a government has ignored the best advice and chosen a method that is ineffective and counterproductive,ó he said, òand, even if they monitor drumlines through the day, leaving the lines in at night could attract other predators to the area, attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured.óworldwide, in 2012, there were 80 attacks by sharks. seven of the attacks were fatal. this is compared to nearly 100 million sharks killed by humans each year. rspca australia says it believes the cull is wrong. òthere is no evidence that the increase in attacks is a result of increasing shark numbers. we think it is the result of a changing population and changing human behaviour; that is, there are more people in the water,ó it said.richard branson said the idea was not working. òiõm sure one of the reasons western australia premier, colin barnett, did it was because he was thinking it would encourage tourism. itõs going to do the opposite, i think. youõre advertising a problem that doesnõt exist in a big way and youõre going to stop people from wanting to come to perth and your beautiful countryside around it. all youõre going to achieve, i think, is to worry people.ó
elementary	"the age of the big british summer music festival, including glastonbury, is ending, according to the top rock manager harvey goldsmith.he has produced and worked with most of the western worldõs biggest music stars, including the who, the rolling stones, queen, madonna, bob dylan and luciano pavarotti. he says that the biggest problem is a serious lack of major new bands to follow on from the old ones.òthe age of the music festival peaked about two years ago,ó he said, speaking at the hay festival of literature and arts in wales. òthere are too many festivals and there are not enough big bands to headline them. that is a big, big problem for us. and we are not producing new bands that can headline ð like the rolling stones, muse, even the arctic monkeys.óthere were about 900 music festivals in the uk between may and september in 2014, he said, and they cannot all continue. there will be lots of small combination festivals where it isnõt just music but also poetry or books or magic shows.goldsmith, 69, said that he is working with robin de levita, the dutch producer of the whoõs 1970s rock musical tommy. they will bring the  rst stage adaptation of the teen book and movie series the hunger games to a new 1,100-seat theatre in wembley, london, in june 2016.talking at hay, goldsmith also revealed some of the secrets of his long career in the music industry. he said that keith moon put dynamite down a sydney hotel room toilet to unblock it. and, he said that john lennon had stage fright at madison square garden in 1974 ð he vomited and they had to push him onto the stage. òitõs bizarre how common stage fright is among artists. itõs odd how afraid they get but, as soon as the music starts, theyõre  ne,ó he said.he also gave the answer to a rock õnõ roll mystery: why elvis presley never performed outside north america. presleyõs manager, colonel tom parker, told goldsmith that the real reason why elvis never performed in england was because parker was an immigrant.òhe explained that it was because he was an illegal dutch immigrant. he didnõt want to risk leaving the us,ó said goldsmith.and his ultimate rock õnõ roll performer? òfreddie mercury was our most powerful stage performer, the best live performer weõve ever had.óbut there is no group to follow queen, he said. òweõre not producing a new generation of this kind of band. coldplay is probably the last one and that was ten years ago.""so, with no big bands to headline, there are no big shows. glastonbury now canõt  nd any more big bands. the time of big music festivals is really ending.ónannannan"
elementary	a canadian man became famous because he gave a free round-the-world trip to a woman with the same name as his ex-girlfriend. the man has now returned from the trip with the woman he chose. unfortunately, people who followed the story were disappointed because the pair did not fall in love. jordan axani, a 28-year-old from toronto who started a charity, arrived back in canada with elizabeth quinn gallagher and said the pair were like brother and sister.axani became famous in 2014 when he offered an air ticket to any canadian named elizabeth gallagher. he reserved a three-week holiday with his girlfriend but they split up and he was unable to change the name on the tickets.axani’s new travelling companion, was, of course, called elizabeth gallagher. she was a 23-year-old student from cole harbour, nova scotia. this elizabeth gallagher, who calls herself quinn, replied to an online posting from axani and he chose her. before the trip, she already had a boyfriend. but people still hoped that the globetrotters might fall in love. unfortunately, they didn’t.“i’m going to be very clear,” axani said, soon after the pair returned to toronto. “the trip was never a romantic idea. it was completely platonic. i do not think of quinn in a romantic way at all. she is a good friend. i think of her as a little sister – that is all.”but it was difficult to create that brother-sister relationship. “it wasn’t easy and it wasn’t immediate. it took us about a week to really understand each other,” axani said. they made some mistakes as the pair got to know each other. “at the end of the trip, we’d developed a really great rhythm – one second, we had really funny jokes and, the next second, we knew when the other person needed time alone.”the pair did not fall in love, but axani said the trip was “fantastic”. they visited milan, venice, vienna, prague, khao lak (in thailand) and hong kong. a favourite place was prague, axani said, where they met more people than anywhere else on the trip. “during two and a half days, i think we met about 24 people. so that’s a lot of stories, that’s a lot of people and that’s a lot of love for their home city of prague.”people followed the pair on twitter and instagram, axani said. and they were even recognized in the street in hong kong. “it was an adventure. we had a great time. we learned a lot about ourselves and about each other.”axani arrived back in toronto at 3am and went directly to a meeting at his charity, a ticket forward. axani started the charity after his online posting went viral – he plans to offer round-the-world-trips to victims of abuse, cancer and war.axani also wants to turn his story into a television show or film, he said. “there’s been lots of interest from many production companies.” axani said he was not looking for his next elizabeth gallagher yet. “i’m not looking for anything. but we’ll see,” he said. “as always, life is a journey.”nan
elementary	there are many quirky solutions to help make our cities better places to live, such as glow-in-the-dark trees, underground bike sheds and solar-powered bins. city living is good in many ways but it is not always possible to lead a sustainable lifestyle in a city. pollution, traf c and loss of green spaces are just some of the daily problems that people in cities have to live with. we look at ten quirky solutions that could make our cities better places to live.pop-up parks todayõs cities sometimes look like theyõre built for cars and not for people. the pop-up park is a simple idea. you need an empty car park, a small amount of money and a plant or two, and you can make your own private park. the park(ing) project started as an arts experiment in san francisco. it has since spread across the world.underground storage not everyone in a city has a car. bikes are in fashion but there is one problem: where to keep the bike safe? an engineering company in tokyo has a solution: an underground bicycle park. just seven metres wide, the bicycle park goes deep enough into the ground to keep 204 bikes.glow-in-the-dark trees when most people think of trees that glow in the dark, they usually think of christmas trees. not daan roosegaarde. the dutch designer-artist has invented a plant that is like a light. the technology joins dna from glowing marine bacteria with a plant to create a glow like a jelly sh. roosegaarde hopes that this technology could one day replace normal street lighting. pedestrian electricity every day, hundreds of people in the east london neighbourhood of west ham cross a pedestrian walkway close to the underground station. they probably donõt notice the springiness of the walkway. and they probably donõt know that the springy rubber surface powers the streetlights above. the  oor has tiles that capture the energy from pedestriansõ footsteps and turn it into electricity. there is a similar system at londonõs heathrow airport. supertrees singaporeõs gardens by the bay has a group of man-made trees. up to 50 metres high, these steel ôsupertreesõ have  owers growing up them. they collect rainwater and 11 of the 18 trees also have solar panels on their ôbranchesõ.
elementary	a new computer-assisted autopsy system is becoming more and more popular in european hospitals. its inventor says that the system could mean that now there will be no such thing as a ‘perfect murder’.the method, called ‘virtopsy’, is being used at some forensic medical institutes in europe. it was invented by a group of scientists at the university of zurich. instead of cutting the chest, like in a traditional autopsy, pathologists are now able to examine the dead body in 3-d via computer screens.michael thali, the director of zurich’s institute for forensic medicine in europe, and one of the inventors of virtopsy, said it could completely change criminal investigations. “basically there will be no such thing as the perfect murder any more because a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence,” he said.virtopsies use powerful machines. together, the machines are called a ‘virtobot’. virtopsies can find injuries that are not seen during a traditional autopsy, as well as air pockets, heart attacks and even cancer.“the virtopsy could replace the autopsy one day,” said richard dirndorfer, one of the first people to use dna analysis in criminology. “i think we’ll see it happen slowly, just like dna analysis slowly replaced blood group analysis”.the method allows doctors to see deep inside dead bodies. it can see things that cannot be found during traditional autopsies.criminologists from around the world have been travelling to switzerland over the past few years to see the new method. forensic scientists and pathologists think the method can be used together with the traditional autopsy.“in order to analyze the colour of the blood, the thickness of body fluids or smells, we’ll need to use traditional autopsy methods,” said lars oesterhelweg, deputy director of the institute of forensic medicine at the charité hospital in berlin, which is using a version of the virtopsy.he added that the new method was very helpful in re-examining cases where the cause of death was unclear. “it means that investigations can be re-examined and we can try again to find the murderer,” he said.scientists said that relatives of the dead prefer the virtopsy method because, during a traditional autopsy, scientists have to cut and damage the dead body.nannan
elementary	introduction did you know that, in the uk, there is no law that says restaurants have to pass on tips to staff?a new government report asked workers, employers and customers what they thought about tipping. after reading the report, the uk government says it wants to change the rules to make sure that low-paid workers get the tips that customers leave for them.the report said that some waiters are made to pay a 15% administration fee on tips that customers pay by credit or debit card.the government said that it wants customers to know that tips are voluntary. they want the tipping process to be made clearer so that everyone can understand it.we asked waiters around the uk what they think of tipping, including how much money they get from tips and if itõs fair.1. rodri, 37, london: ôaround 50% of a waiterõs income is tipsõ average tips: £60 per eight-hour shift i think they treat waiters best in ... the useverything has got fairer since the tipping scandal in the summer of 2015. this is when lots of restaurants were taking money from tips for administration fees. but you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains.i get about £60 in tips per shift. on a good night, this goes up to over £100 and, on a poor night, itõs around £40. around 50% of a waiterõs income is tips. all restaurants should have to tell customers what they do with tips. american waiters are lucky ð everyone tips in america.2. elle, 22, edinburgh: ôwe never know whether itõs fairõ average tips: £20 per eight-hour shift i think they treat waiters best in ... francei have three part-time jobs. my day job is in a cafe where the staff work both in the cafe and in the kitchen so all our tips go in a pot and we all get the same. my evening job is at a restaurant where we dont get our tips but we get the minimum wage plus an extra £2.50 per hour. my third job is events catering and nobody ever tips.in restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips by card, the staff never see how much the tip is ð so we donõt know if what we get is fair or not. the system seems better in france, where they donõt tip much but being a waiter is seen as a proper job with job security and good wages.3. ashley, 22, london: ôtips go towards customer breakagesõ average tips: £10-15 per eight-hour shift i think they treat waiters best in ... australiai work in a london pub in the evenings and i do day shifts at a local restaurant. in both places, all the tips are collected and shared out at the end of the night. money is taken from the tips to pay for breakages by staff and customers.it is very unfair that our tips are shared out, especially when one member of the team doesnõt work hard enough. itõs really unfair that money from our tips is taken for breakages by customers. the managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without taking our tips. i make around £20 a shift in tips but often i only get £10-15 of that money.i really need tips because i am only paid £7 an hour. iõd prefer to get a good basic wage (like in australia) and not have to rely on tips.4. tom, manchester: ôa big night of tips can help pay the rentõ average tips: £40 per eight-hour shift i think they treat waiters best in ... italywhere i used to work, waiters kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips. the rest went to the other staff in the restaurant.itõs hard to say how much i earn in a shift; maybe about £40. it can make a big difference. sometimes, waiters need a good night to be able to pay their rent.they have got tipping right in italy, where customers donõt add a big tip but usually round up their bill so, if their meal is û19, they leave a û20 note and donõt ask for change.nan
elementary	astronaut scott kelly has just spent 340 days in space. he says that himalayan lakes, spacewalks and the us presidential campaign helped him to stay sane during his mission. it was the longest mission ever. òit seemed like i lived there forever,ó kelly said. he had been on several missions before but said that his biggest surprise was how long this mission felt. òmaybe, sometimes, you go bananas,ó he said.kelly and a russian astronaut, mikhail kornienko, spent nearly a year on the international space station (iss). they studied the effects on humans of weightlessness, radiation and the cramped conditions of space ight. this is research that nasa thinks is very important for a future mission to mars.kelly said the length of the mission was the most dif cult thing. he felt more pain after he returned to gravity than after shorter trips. kelly and his twin brother, mark, a retired astronaut, have spent the last year taking physical and mental tests. the tests will continue, to help nasa learn about what happens to the human body during space ight.kelly described the sense of wonder he felt after he landed back on earth. when the russian capsule opened, he felt the cool air of kazakhstan and smelled òa smell like a plant was blooming in that areaó. it was the fresh air mixed with the burnt, òsweetó smell of a spacecraft that had just re- entered through the earthõs atmosphere.when he left the spacecraft, he said, he began to understand the importance of the mission: 340 days on a 15-year-old space station which is òa million pounds, the size of a football  eld, with the space, some say, of a six-bedroom houseó. the iss, he said, is a place that uses the power of the sun and an international team helped to build it. òthe view is great, too,ó he said.kelly posted amazing photos on social media of the earthõs cities, countryside, oceans and atmosphere. òthe earth is a beautiful planet,ó he said. he described the beautiful waters around the bahamas and the rainbow colours of the lakes of the northern himalayas. but òthe main thing you notice is how thin the atmosphere is,ó kelly said. òit is scary to see the thin atmosphere, together with large areas of pollution.óhe said he could see large areas of pollution: smoke clouds from wild res cover parts of the us, parts of asia have pollution nearly all year. he said the message òwe need to save the planetó was slightly wrong: òthe planet will get better; itõs us that wonõt be here because weõll destroy the environment.óòwe must take care of the air we breathe and the water we drink. and i believe we do have a big effect on that and we have the ability to change it, if we want to.ó kelly was very active on social media so many people follow him online. but he said he didnõt know about it ð instead, he watched the news and especially the 2016 us presidential campaign.the news helped keep him sane, he said, and also work: òi looked forward to the next event ð for example, the next spacewalk, the next science experiment. that made a difference to me.ó being back on earth with everyone still felt strange, he said.kelly said that he would probably not  y again with nasa. òbut i donõt think i would ever say iõm absolutely, 100%  nished,ó he said. maybe he will  y with private space ight companies, which are becoming more and more popular. òthey might need a guy like me someday,ó he said. òmaybe, in the next 20 years, youõll be able to buy a cheap ticket, just go for a little visit.ónannannan
elementary	when two people on a remote pacific island saw a small boat washed up on the beach, they decided to take a closer look. inside the boat, they found a very thin man with long hair and a beard, who said he drifted for 16 months after leaving mexico, more than 12,500km away.the man, who was wearing only underpants, told his rescuers that he drifted in the 7.3-metre boat since he left mexico for el salvador in september 2012. a friend died at sea several months before, he said.“his health isn’t good, but he’s getting better,” said ola fjeldstad, a norwegian anthropology student doing research on ebon island, one of the marshall islands. the man said his name was josé ivan. he said he survived by catching turtles and birds. there was no fishing equipment on the boat, but a turtle was inside when it washed up. “the boat looks like it has been in the water for a long time,” fjeldstad said.according to fjeldstad, the people who found the man took him to a nearby island – which is so remote it has only one phone line and no internet – to meet the mayor. the mayor contacted the ministry of foreign affairs in majuro, the marshall islands capital. people at the ministry said that they were waiting for more details and that the man will probably go to the capital.“he’s staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him,” said fjeldstad. he also said that the man had a basic health check and had low blood pressure but no serious problems and was able to walk. “we’re giving him a lot of water and he’s getting stronger.”fraser christian, who teaches people how to survive at sea, said that if the man’s story was true, it would be amazing but not unique. it was possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand, he said, because “they will come close to a small boat to shelter underneath it”. christian advises people who have to eat turtles to start with their eyes – “lots of fluid” – then drink the blood.the main dangers for castaways are cold and a lack of drinking water. “the basic rule is: no water, no food. you need water to digest protein. if you have no fresh water and it doesn’t rain for a few days, so you can’t collect rainwater, you will die.” also, some people are more able to survive than others.stories of survival in the pacific ocean are not rare. in 2006, three mexicans made international headlines when they were found drifting near the marshall islands, also in a small boat. they said they survived for nine months at sea on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds. but cliff downing, who teaches sea survival to sailors, said he wasn’t sure about the latest story. “it just doesn’t sound right to me. there are 1,001 hazards that would make his survival for so long very unlikely.”
elementary	joseph roche is on the shortlist of astronauts for mars one, a private mission that plans to send humans to live on mars from 2025. he is on the shortlist but he is sceptical about mars one.roche is an astrophysicist at trinity college dublin. he is one of the 100 people on the shortlist for the mission. he has doubts about mars one.the selection process, roche says, did not “reach the standard of more traditional astronaut selection processes”. he also says the dutch mars one team are naive because they believe they can succeed alone in the $6 billion mission. he says they should now accept it will probably not happen.the group plans to send a lander and satellite to mars in 2018, followed by a rover in 2020 and cargo missions starting in 2022. humans will start arriving in 2025 and they will send more crews of four people every two years. the astronauts will not return to earth.gerard ’t hooft is a dutch nobel laureate in physics. he is a supporter of the project but he says he does not believe the mars one plans are realistic. he said: “it will take longer and be more expensive. when they asked me to be involved, i told them: ‘you have to put a zero after everything’.”roche also said that there were not 200,000 people who applied to be astronauts, as mars one said; there were only 2,761.he talked about the selection process in more detail: “i have not met anyone from mars one. at first, they said there would be regional interviews; we would travel there, and they would interview and test us over several days. to me, that sounded like a proper astronaut selection process.“but it changed from a proper regional interview over several days to a ten-minute skype call.”roche says he does not want to give more interviews because he doesn’t want to sound negative about space travel.he said that being involved in the public debate about future missions is one of the most interesting and enjoyable things about his connection with mars one. he then said that, “if a one-way mission to mars ever became possible, i would always volunteer. for an astrophysicist, that is not a difficult decision to make.” but he does not think there will be a one-way mission in his lifetime.nannannannan
advanced	"maria is sitting on a black plastic chair in a community centre on a cold tuesday afternoon waiting for her number to be called. she is number 34.when itõs her turn, maria is called forward to pick up a brown paper bag  lled with essentials including pasta, eggs and corn akes, and is invited to choose between butternut squash or carrots as this weekõs vegetables.maria is the 34th òclientó so far today at east hampton food pantry, a community initiative set up just streets away from some of the most expensive and exclusive properties in the world.by the end of the day, the food pantryõs organizers expect more than 400 families to have followed maria through the doors to collect their weekly food parcel to help them get through the cold, dark long island winter.in the summertime, the hamptons, a collection of historic oceanfront towns and villages 100 miles from manhattan, is a billionairesõ playground. but, come labor day in early september, when the rich and famous shut up their mansions and head back to manhattan or beverly hills, the glitz gives way to the gritty reality of life for the mostly immigrant community who live here all year.òthe people who come here are rich and famous but we who live here are not,ó says maria, who works 14-hour days in the summer cleaning mansions but goes months without any work at all in the winter.maria laughs when asked if she has enough money. òthere is no work in the winter, only in the summertime,ó says maria, who, like many of the workers in the hamptons, is from latin america. òhere, lots of people live in a single room because they canõt pay the rent.óshe says some families with up to  ve children are crammed into basements and still pay more than $1,000 a month in rent. òpeople come here looking for work but, in the winter, there is nothing.ólots of her friends canõt pay for heating or medication and many would go hungry if it were not for the east hampton food pantry, she says, which is just one of several food pantries in the town.vicki littman, chairperson of the east hampton food pantry, which provided more than 31,000 food parcels in 2015, says the number of people seeking out the food pantry is ever increasing.òonce labor day comes and the season is over and peopleõs hours start to be cut back, our numbers go up to about 400 families a week,ó she says. òwhen they come to us on tuesday, they get two to three daysõ worth of food. without us, they would struggle that much more.""littman says it can be hard for outsiders to realize that there are people struggling to get by in a place known the world over for its excess. òwhen i discuss with the summer community that comes out here about the food pantries, theyõre always shocked because there is that glamorous side of the hamptons where there are galas and the beaches and the mansions that are here. òbut, what people donõt realize is that there is that service industry. itõs the landscapers, the nannies, the waitresses ð they are all relying on that summer income to get them through the winter but people donõt see that when theyõre coming out on holiday.òthere are seniors who have to sometimes pick between whether they are going to pay for their medications or pay their bills or buy food, and that shouldnõt be the case.ólittman says the town has lost too many people working key jobs ð such as teachers, police of cers and even doctors and dentists ð because they canõt afford to live in the community and the food pantry board is determined to do more to ensure people have a better shot at staying put.housing is, by far, the biggest cost in the hamptons. at $147m, the nationõs most expensive property is hedge fund manager barry rosensteinõs 18-acre beachfront estate at 67 further lane, a stoneõs throw from maidstone golf club, which is considered òthe most elite, prestigious and dif cult to get intoó of all the hamptons clubs.larry cantwell, east hamptonõs town supervisor and lifelong resident, says homes regularly change hands at more than $25m and the rapid price in ation at the top end has trickled down to even the townõs most modest  ats.òfinding your  rst home is a challenge in an area like this,ó cantwell says. ònot just people who you would characterize as poor ð working- and middle-class families are also having a hard time. if you can  nd a home to buy anywhere in east hampton for $500,000, youõre very lucky.ócantwell says more than half the townõs homes are empty for most of the year, which causes the population to dwindle to as little as 10,000 in the winter months compared with 80,000 in august.òitõs kind of the tale of two cities. thereõs certainly a lot of wealth here but almost all of that wealth is in second homes only used in the summer,ó says cantwell, the son of a  sherman father and a house-cleaner mother. òbut, the rest of us live here year round.òthere are famous and very wealthy people but then you have hard-working and poor people struggling to get by. youõve got to remember that this community was founded as a farming and  shing community of people who lived off the land and the water ð a real working-class community.ócantwell says saving up enough money to buy your  rst house while working as a farmer or  sherman is near-impossible in east hampton today òand itõs not just the poor ð police of cers, teachers, young professionals and others all struggle to  nd a place to live here and many of them cannot afford to own their own home.óbeing homeless in the hamptons means spending a lot of time on a bus. various houses of worship have joined together to ensure there is somewhere for the homeless to spend the night over the winter. churches up and down the north and south fork of long island take on the burden one night at a time and roughly 50 homeless people are bussed between them every day.eddie vallone, 22, is one of those on the bus every night. òpeople look at the hamptons as some sort of rich town and thereõs no problems going on. but there are a lot of problems here, especially drugs.""itõs hard to really grasp ð ôok, the summer is coming to an end. what am i going to do for the winter?õó vallone says at maureenõs haven, a charity that coordinates the homeless shelter programme. òi want to work but thereõs no work to be done.óvallone, who works cleaning pools and doing odd jobs on luxury estates, says that, if he saves well and doesnõt impulse-buy, he can make his summer earnings stretch out until november. òbut, work doesnõt start again until may or the beginning of june.ó"

advanced	it was not so much how hard people found the challenge but how far they would go to avoid it that left researchers gobsmacked. the task? to sit in a chair and do nothing but think.so unbearable did some  nd it that they took up the safe but alarming opportunity to give themselves mild electric shocks in an attempt to break the tedium.two-thirds of men pressed a button to deliver a painful jolt during a 15-minute spell of solitude.under the same conditions, a quarter of women pressed the shock button. the difference, scientists suspect, is that men tend to be more sensation-seeking than women.the report from psychologists at virginia and harvard universities is one of a surprising few to tackle the question of why most of us  nd it so hard to do nothing.in more than 11 separate studies, the researchers showed that people hated being left to think, regardless of their age, education, income or the amount of time they spent using smartphones or social media.timothy wilson, who led the work, said the  ndings were not necessarily a re ection of the pace of modern life or the spread of mobile devices and social media. instead, those things might be popular because of our constant urge to do something rather than nothing.the  rst run of experiments began with students being ushered ð alone, without phones, books or anything to write with ð into an unadorned room and told to think. the only rules were they had to stay seated and not fall asleep. they were informed ð speci cally or vaguely ð that they would have six to 15 minutes alone.the students were questioned when the time was up. on average, they did not enjoy the experience. they struggled to concentrate. their minds wandered even with nothing to distract them. even giving them time to think about what to think about did not help.in case the unfamiliar setting hampered the ability to think, the researchers ran the experiment again with people at home.they got much the same results, only people found the experience even more miserable and cheated by getting up from their chair or checking their phones.to see if the effect was found only in students, the scientists recruited more than 100 people, aged 18 to 77, from a church and a farmersõ market. they, too, disliked being left to their thoughts.but, the most staggering result was yet to come. to check whether people might actually prefer something bad to nothing at all, the students were given the option of administering a mild electric shock.they had been asked earlier to rate how unpleasant the shocks were, alongside other options, such as looking at pictures of cockroaches or hearing the sound of a knife rubbing against a bottle.all the students picked for the test said they would pay to avoid mild electric shocks after receiving a demonstration.to the researchersõ surprise, 12 of 18 men gave themselves up to four electric shocks, as did six of 24 women.òwhat is striking is that simply being alone with their thoughts was apparently so aversive that it drove many participants to self-administer an electric shock that they had earlier said they would pay to avoid,ó the scientists write in science.jessica andrews-hanna at the university of colorado said many students would probably zap themselves to cheer up a tedious lecture. but, she says more needs to be known about the motivation of the shockers in wilsonõs study.òimagine the setup ð a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will deliver a harmless but uncomfortable shock, and they are told to just sit there and entertain themselves with their thoughts,ó she said.òas they sit there, strapped to this machine, their mind starts to wander and it naturally goes to that shock ð was it really that bad?òwhat are the experimenters really interested in? perhaps this is a case where curiosity killed the cat.ó

issued by the queen said: “all the children of the eldest son of the prince of wales should have and enjoy the style, title and attribute of royal highness with the titular dignity of prince or princess prefixed to their christian names or with such other titles of honour.”following tradition, a formal notice was posted on an ornate rococo-style easel – the same used to announce prince william’s birth in 1982 – in the forecourt of buckingham palace shortly before 9pm. within an hour, the numbers had swelled from hundreds to thousands outside the palace, with locals and tourists alike keen to share in the historic moment.new yorker, sharon surloff, was delighted with her phone picture of the royal bulletin, snapped after she and her niece and mother had squeezed through crowds to take a photograph of the easel.“the police were just saying to everyone: ‘ok, 20 seconds and then the next person’. it’s just great to be here, though. we arrived this morning, at nine in the morning, so it has all worked out beautifully.”the palace announced the birth in a press release. minutes later, as crowds of wellwishers outside cheered, “it’s a boy”, the formal medical bulletin was taken from the hospital to a waiting car by ed perkins, prince william’s press secretary. he handed it to a soldier, who then took the notice, which was signed by marcus setchell, the queen’s gynaecologist, to buckingham palace under police escort.the prime minister was one of the first to offer his congratulations. speaking outside 10 downing street, david cameron said: “it is wonderful news from st mary’s, paddington, and i am sure that, right across the country, and, indeed, right across the commonwealth, people will be celebrating and wishing the royal couple well.“it is an important moment in the life of our nation but, i suppose, above all, it is a wonderful moment for a warm and loving couple who have got a brand new baby boy. it has been a remarkable few years for our royal family: a royal wedding that captured people’s hearts, that extraordinary and magnificent jubilee and now this royal birth – all from a family that has given this nation so much incredible service.”congratulations came from the white house, too, from barack obama and his wife. the president said: “michelle and i are so pleased to congratulate the duke and duchess of cambridge on the joyous occasion of the birth of their first child. we wish them all the happiness and blessings parenthood brings.”the archbishop of canterbury, the most rev justin welby, tweeted: “delighted for the duke and duchess of cambridge. may god bless them all with love, health and happiness.”the labour leader, ed miliband, said: “many congratulations to the duke and duchess of cambridge. i wish them and their son all happiness and good health.”the campaign group, republic, which launched its born equal initiative calling for every child to be born equal in political status and rights, said the royal birth raised questions about britain and democratic values. chief executive graham smith said the baby should be able to grow up without “constant interference and intrusion”. he said: “here is a new baby whose career, religion, even personal relationships have already been mapped out. meanwhile, this is an opportunity for the rest of us to consider whether this circus is the best way to run things.”
advanced	a day that began with a fresh round of dawn raids on the baur au lac hotel in zurich ended with 16 football officials being indicted on corruption charges in the us, including five current or former members of fifa’s executive committee. they included the notorious former brazilian federation chief ricardo teixeira and his successor, marco polo del nero, who has recently stepped down from the fifa executive committee.they were among 16 individuals accused of fraud and other offences by the us department of justice as it set out a series of kickback schemes in a new 240-page indictment that superseded the previous one in may 2015. it takes to 27 the number of defendants charged by the us with a further 24 unnamed ‘co-conspirators’ including former fifa executive committee members. “the betrayal of trust set forth here is outrageous,” the us attorney general, loretta lynch, said. “the scale of corruption alleged herein is completely unacceptable.”on a day when fifa’s executive committee had hoped to present new reforms in the midst of an ongoing corruption crisis, swiss police led away the president of the south american football confederation, the paraguayan juan ángel napout, and alfredo hawit, the head of the north and central american and caribbean governing body. hawit only succeeded jeffrey webb in may 2015, after webb was arrested as part of the us operation that threw fifa into crisis and precipitated the downfall of sepp blatter. webb’s predecessor, the controversial jack warner, was also seized in may.the swiss federal office of justice said of the latest arrests: “they are being held in custody pending their extradition. according to the us arrest requests, they are suspected of accepting bribes of millions of dollars”. webb and the colombian former executive committee member luis bedoya were among those whose guilty pleas were entered in the us. lynch said that eight individuals, five of them unnamed in the original indictment, had come forward with guilty pleas since may.eleven current and former members of fifa’s executive committee have now been charged in the investigation, which alleges $200m in bribes, mainly as kickbacks from tv and marketing contracts but also fifa’s development programmes. the last three presidents of the regional bodies concacaf and conmebol have all been indicted.“the message from this announcement should be clear to every culpable individual who remains in the shadows, hoping to evade our investigation: you will not escape our focus,” said lynch. teixeira, the former son-in-law of the longstanding fifa president joão havelange, was charged alongside del nero and his predecessor, josé maria marin, who was charged in may.fourteen men had been charged in may 2015, when four additional guilty pleas were entered. days later, blatter won a fifth term as president but later agreed to step down as the crisis grew. he was then provisionally suspended alongside the uefa president, michel platini, over an alleged £1.3m “disloyal payment” to the frenchman. both men face possible life bans when their case is heard by the fifa ethics committee in december if they are found guilty of the charges.among those also charged on thursday were rafael salguero, a guatemalan who left the executive committee in may; the former south american confederation secretary general, eduardo deluca; peru’s former football federation president, manuel burga; and bolivia’s football president, carlos chaves, already jailed in his own country.lynch said: “the department of justice is committed to ending the rampant corruption we have described amidst the leadership of international football – not only because of the scale of the schemes alleged earlier and today, or the breadth of the operation required to sustain such corruption, but also because of the affront to international principles that this behaviour represents.”the acting fifa president, issa hayatou, refused to comment on the detail of the latest arrests. but he maintained neither he nor the organization was corrupt. appearing for the first time before the media since taking the role in september 2015, when blatter was suspended, hayatou responded in a similar way to his predecessors in improbably claiming the current crisis was down to a handful of errant individuals.“fifa is not corrupt. we have individuals that have shown negative behaviour. do not generalize the situation,” said hayatou, president of the confederation of african football for more than 25 years. “there are lots of people who have been in fifa for more than 20 or 30 years that have not been accused of anything.”
advanced	to a master traditional navigator like tua pittman from raratonga in the cook islands, a canoe is much more than just a means of transport. òthe canoe is our island, the crew members are the community and the navigator is the leader,ó pittman says. he continues, explaining that the converse is also true. òan island is our canoe, the community are the crew members and the politicians and leaders are the navigators. on a canoe, you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds. navigation is using the philosophies of being a leader to show your crew members the light of life.óit has been a whirlwind week for the crews of the  otilla of four sailing canoes since arriving in sydney for the start of the world parks congress. tuaõs journey began at the cook islands on 25 september. the  rst leg took the islanders to samoa, then fiji, vanuatu and onto the gold coast, before heading south to sydney. around 100 crew members were involved in the various stages of the voyage and they aimed to travel using only traditional navigation techniques. unfortunately, said tua, the crews were forced to rely on modern navigation equipment on some occasions to reach australia in time for the congress.the of cial title of the expedition is the mua voyage and it is a partnership between the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) oceania regional of ce and  ve paci c island countries: samoa, tonga, new zealand, the cook islands and fiji. the main goal of the 6,000-nautical-mile (11,000km) trip was to deliver a special message to the world parks congress.in part, the message said: òwe see the signs of overexploitation. we no longer see the  sh and other marine creatures in the size, diversity or abundance of the past. we witness the change as foreign  shing  eets ply our waters in a race to strip our resources. our coral reefs, the greatest in the world, and our mangrove and wetland spawning grounds are disappearing. our ocean is vast but not limitless. growing global populations and the relentless pursuit of unsustainable development are reducing the ability of our ocean to sustain life.óin spite of the effort and urgency behind the paci c islandersõ message to the delegates of the congress, much of the  nal days of the marine part of the congress were taken up with trying to set a revised target for the amount of the ocean that needs to be protected in marine sanctuaries. according to the iucn, as of 2013, the amount of the worldõs oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is ôno takeõ. this was despite a target of 20-30% no-take areas set by the last world parks congress held in south africa in 2003.world-leading marine scientist professor callum roberts from the university of york was one of the scientists who helped set the 20-30% target in 2003. but he said it was not enough. òthe iucn should now lift its target from 30 to 33%. new research strengthens the case for the 30% target set previously to now be raised. any reduction in efforts at this stage and moment in history would be disastrous for our oceans.óafter dif cult negotiations, the world parks congress delegates passed a motion that will dramatically shift the goals for global marine management. instead of the 20-30% aspirational target, the iucnõs new of cial position is to òurgently increase the ocean area that is effectively and equitably managed in ecologically representative and well-connected systems of mpas [marine protected areas] or other effective conservation measures by 2030; these should include strictly protected areas that amount to at least 30% of each marine habitat and address both biodiversity and ecosystem services.ótua pittman was delighted with the news that a strong resolution on the planetõs oceans had passed the congress. òitõs just like a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here and to be heard. to hear they made that resolution is fantastic. itõs a step in the right direction.ó he says that, while much of the traditional navigational aids were things such as the sun, moon and stars that never changed and would, at least on a human scale, always be there, other impacts of environmental degradation were becoming clearer when voyaging across the paci c.he said he was 55 and, in his lifetime, he was already beginning to see that it was much harder to catch  sh on the open ocean. he also said that pollution was worsening, particularly as the canoes approached big cities such as sydney. and the effects of climate change were already beginning to impact seriously on paci c islanders. òthe decisions of the big countries have twice, thrice, four times the impact on the small countries than on developed, large nations. many times, people donõt even know where our islands are and, from the eyes of a traditional navigator, our people have a very, very deep concern because we are talking about decisions made far away that impact on our homes.ó the mua voyage had been a massive logistical undertaking, said tua. years of preparation and navigational planning went into such a trip and it was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and acted. the leaders of wealthy countries, he went on, need to start to think more like traditional navigators who recognize their vessels are mere specks in an enormous sea. most importantly, and spoken like a true navigator, tua says politicians must seek a different route to avoid the pending ecological crises that are beginning to befall the small island nations. òthe world needs to  nd a different path.ó
advanced	they call it the richie rich club and it is about to get even richer. india’s wealthiest will quadruple their net worth between now and 2018, a report says, with hundreds of thousands of new entrepreneurs and inheritors becoming multimillionaires. the survey, based on interviews with 150 ultra-high-net-worth individuals, comes amid signs of returning business confidence in the world’s biggest democracy.recent years have seen lacklustre growth, rising prices of basic foodstuffs and a weakening currency. but the bharatiya janata party (bjp) won a landslide victory in may 2014 on a pledge to reinvigorate the ailing economy. despite the slowdown, there are nearly a sixth more indians worth in excess of $3.75m than in 2013, the report for the kotak mahindra bank notes. “cities are mushrooming, the middle class population growing, opportunities have increased manyfold and the political environment has improved greatly in recent months,” according to murali balaraman, a co-author.between them, india’s rich hold assets worth a trillion dollars, which is around a fifth of the total wealth in the country. by 2018, that total is likely to reach $4tn, the report says, making three times as many people multimillionaires.serving the new rich – and the old money – is a booming luxury market. “they really want to show or talk about their wealth in a really subtle way and consumption of luxury goods is a nice way to do it,” balaraman said. abhay gupta, the ceo of brand consultancy luxury connect, said the market for top-end goods and experiences would “only get bigger”. “there is a huge aspirational class who look up to what the very wealthy are doing and then copy it,” he said.cars are among the most popular items bought, the report says. whereas, in 2009, locally made suvs were shown off by the wealthy, now only foreign cars will turn heads. mercedes saw a 47% surge in sales in india in 2013. bmw has launched a new $200,000 model in delhi.india’s appalling infrastructure restricts demand, however. lamborghini’s chief executive, stephan winkelmann, admitted, in 2013, that the traffic and roads in india “are not so suitable” for the $450,000 sports cars. in india, lamborghini sells two models: the gallardo and the aventador, which has a top speed of 217mph. winkelmann said lamborghini’s indian customers were much younger than those in europe, with a typical buyer being in his 30s. however, the most popular investments remain real estate – mainly within india – and jewellery.india’s super-rich have long raised eyebrows around the world with their spectacular spending. mukesh ambani, the country’s wealthiest man, has built the world’s most valuable home in mumbai, the commercial capital. the 27-storey tower, complete with helicopter pads, indoor cinemas and a staff of more than 600, is worth an estimated $1bn.the three-day wedding of the niece of lakshmi mittal, the uk-based steel tycoon who is worth an estimated $16bn, was reported to have cost $80m. hundreds of guests were flown to barcelona for the ceremony and party, which took place in a museum in the city.but buyers of luxury goods searching for the psychological satisfaction of exclusivity are becoming increasingly demanding, the kotak mahindra report says. one ordered nine cases of japanese whisky costing over $750 a bottle for a wedding reception. the attraction of the imported whisky was that no one who attended the wedding would find out how to source the same drink in india, the report adds. another big spender systematically bought identical pairs of louis vuitton bags, then cut up half of them to make clothes that would match her accessories.even the traditional wedding is evolving fast. presents such as silver plates, dried fruit or sweets once sent with wedding invitations are being replaced by gifts by top western designer brands. “these days, it’s rolex watches and louis vuitton bags,” says gupta.almost half new ultra-high-net-worth individuals live in smaller provincial cities. a high proportion give substantial amounts to charity, though the report notes that the “growth of philanthropic spends in india has not been proportional to overall growth in ultra-high-net-worth individual wealth”.co-author balaraman says that growth in the number of rich people would not result in social tensions as a wide gap in incomes and wealth is an “accepted norm” in india. “people know that someone is rich and someone is poor and they carry on with their lives,” he explains.
advanced	a canadian man who sprang to fame after offering a free round-the-world trip to a woman with the same name as his ex-girlfriend has returned from the jaunt with his chosen namesake, although, to the dismay of those following the story, love did not blossom between the pair. jordan axani, a 28-year-old toronto real-estate developer turned charity founder, made it back to canada with elizabeth quinn gallagher but said the pair had “forged a brother-sister-like relationship”.axani had made headlines in 2014 after offering an air ticket to any canadian named elizabeth gallagher. he had booked a three-week vacation with his ex-girlfriend but, after they split up, he was unable to change the name on the flights.that’s where axani’s new travelmate, a 23-year-old student from cole harbour, nova scotia, came in. gallagher, who goes by the name quinn, replied to a reddit post axani had submitted – along with other hopeful elizabeth gallaghers – and was selected. gallagher had made it clear before the trip that she had a “pretty serious” boyfriend but that had not stopped romantics, and journalists, from hoping the globetrotters might fall for one another. unfortunately, it was not to be.“i’m going to be explicitly clear,” axani said, shortly after the pair returned to toronto. “this was never a romantic endeavour. it was strictly platonic. i do not think of quinn in a romantic light in the least. there is no future for us romantically. she is a good friend. i think of her as a little sister but that will be it. and her feelings are entirely mutual in that regard.” it took work to establish that brother-sister, good-friend, no-future-for-us-romantically relationship, however.“it wasn’t easy and it certainly wasn’t immediate. it took us about a week to really figure each other out,” axani said. there was a certain amount of “natural stumbling” around “the dos and don’ts of travelling together” as the pair got to know each other. “at the end of it, we’d developed a really great rhythm of, one second, having really funny inside jokes, and, the next second, knowing when the other needed space.”although the pair failed to fall for one another, axani said the trip, which took in milan, venice, vienna, prague, khao lak (in thailand) and hong kong, was “fantastic”. a favourite place was prague, axani said, where they “had the largest groundswell of people reaching out”.“over the course of two and a half days, i think we met about two dozen people. so that’s a lot of stories, that’s a lot of individuals and that’s a lot of love for their home city of prague.”people were following the pair on twitter and instagram, axani said, and they were even recognized in the street in hong kong. “it was a real adventure. we had a blast. we learned a lot about ourselves and about each other. i think, coming out of it, i can’t imagine it going much better than it did.”axani made it back to toronto at 3am on monday, 12 january, when the holiday came to an abrupt halt. he went straight into a board meeting with fellow board members at his charity, a ticket forward. axani started the non-profit organization after his reddit post went viral and intends to offer round-the-world-trips to survivors of abuse, cancer and war.alongside that, axani is also in talks to spin his story into a television show or film, although he would not comment on what form those productions might take. “suffice to say there’s been significant interest from many production companies. we’re well advanced.” in terms of his love life, axani said he was not looking for his next elizabeth gallagher just yet. “i’m not looking for anything, per se, but life happens and we’ll see,” he said. “as always, life’s a journey.”
advanced	that millennials rely heavily on technology is no secret. more than eight in ten say they sleep with a mobile phone by their bed, almost two thirds admit to texting while driving, one in  ve has posted a video of themselves online and three quarters have created a pro le on a social networking site.compared to other generations, millennials are the most active on social media, according to a 2010 report, with 75% of them having created at least one social media account. in contrast, only 50% of generation x, 30% of baby boomers and 6% of those aged 65 and older use social media. but there is a small percentage of millennials who donõt use social media at all. meet the millennials bucking the trend.celan beausoleil, 31, oakland, california beausoleil is a social worker and has had an òon and off, more off than onó relationship with facebook. she last deactivated her account in december 2015 after  nding the amount of personal information shared by others òtoo heavyó to deal with on top of her work demands.òa lot of my job is listening to peopleõs lives all day, every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybodyõs life, including people that i donõt really have a relationship with,ó she said. òit feels almost like intimacy overload.ó she added: òiõm holding a lot in my work life for people and sometimes it felt like it was too heavy to do in my personal life also.óbut beausoleil does love the way social media connects the world in a truly unique way, citing it as one of her only reasons for staying on facebook for as long as she did. òone thing i really liked about facebook was that i could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and one of their friends and one of their friends and literally end up on someoneõs facebook page from the other side of the world,ó she said. òi used to do that all the time.ójason mathias, 26, baltimore, maryland òone day, i realized iõm spending so much time doing this. these little seconds add up. i wonder what it would be like if i didnõt spend these seconds here and spent them doing something else. what if i was doing other things with these seconds? what would they become? would i enjoy it?ómathias, who works for the baltimore city government, had facebook and twitter accounts for years before deleting them both in november 2012. but he òquickly forgot that facebook existedó after his impromptu decision to end his social media presence. he can still appreciate the bene ts that come with having social media accounts, like when he met his girlfriendõs friends for the  rst time and realized òhumanizing 20 people youõre meeting at a partyó is much easier if you can connect their faces, hometowns and jobs to a photo later on. or how easy it is to organize large events online. mathias relies on friends for party invites and is sure there are times he òslips through the cracksó.but, now, he relishes the time thatõs freed up. he spends his lift rides and spare moments at work reading news articles and books rather than scrolling through a newsfeed. and with no friendsõ accounts to follow online, he has to òpick up the phone and call themó, something heõs come to òde nitely enjoyó.lauren raskauskas, 22, naples, florida raskauskas describes herself as a òpretty privateó person. so social media, which can open you up to the scrutiny and analysis of others, is not that appealing to her. òiõm more privacy-minded and have concerns about giving out my data,ó said raskauskas, who is currently looking for a job.she recently deleted her twitter account and deactivated her facebook account two years ago after realizing she òdidnõt like everyone knowing what i was doingó. but raskauskas, who was late to the facebook game because her òparents were really strict with technologyó, can see the positive sides of social media. when a friend of hers that sheõd lost track of moved to naples for a month, raskauskas didnõt even realize she was there until after sheõd left, which the 22-year-old said òwas a bummeró.but in the end, her privacy concerns outweighed any bene ts social media could provide and she saw a de nite upside when she went through a recent break-up. the last time a relationship of hers ended and she was online, it was not pleasant. òone time, i did break up with somebody while i was on facebook and i was like ôoh my gosh, should i change my pro le photo? should i change my status?õ and, this time, i donõt have to worry about any of that because that kind of stuff is pretty hard,ó she said.hariharan rajagopalan, 18, boston, massachusetts rajagopalan, a student at boston college, doesnõt see any drawbacks to abstaining from social media. he claims that he òhasnõt seen any effect at this pointó. even though classmates post about parties and events on facebook, they make sure to send him a text message, too, he said. òsince i was young, i was always a step behind on that kind of thing so it never really mattered to me,ó he said.in fact, the only time rajagopalan made use of social media was when it was unavoidable: it was the only way to reach his new roommate at college. before starting his  rst year at college, he signed up for his  rst, and only, social media account. he joined facebook in order to contact his future roommate and talk about their plans for that year.months later, he still has the account but he admits: òi donõt use it. i donõt check it or anything like that.ó the most activity it sees is when his two sisters tag him in family photos. he has avoided social media accounts in all other situations, though he has felt the draw of twitter. as a sports fan, he acknowledged that òitõs where most of the news breaks outó. but he refused to get an account, stating: òi donõt really need one to read tweetsó.
